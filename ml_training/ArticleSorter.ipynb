       "['The following irresponsible police action reported by KHOU’s Rucks Russell should scare many. Here is the story as reported.A young 13 year old dancer Landry Thompson came to Houston from Oklahoma. She travelled with her two dance instructors over the weekend. The intent of their visit was to train all weekend with some of the best in dance industry.When they left the studio Saturday night they stopped at a gas station very exhausted as they searched for their lodging. They were trying to locate their hotel on the GPS. Out of nowhere they were surrounded by the Houston police.The Houston police dragged them out of the car and handcuffed them all.“I was kind of freaked out and surprised by it” said Landry Thompson.“They just pulled us out of the car. Put our hands behind out backs like we were criminals” said Landry’s dance instructor Emmanuel Hurd. “He asked me; who is the girl? She is my student. I said I have a notarized letter from her parents stating that I have full guardianship over her while we are here.”Landry Thompson and the instructors said they pleaded with the police and told the police their story repeatedly. It did not matter to the Houston police. Landry Thompson said “They still put handcuffs on me. And it really scared me. And they put me in the back of the cop car. I was terrified.” Landry Thompson was taken to Protective Services.“I was horrified. She was with the people I wanted her to be with. She was with people who were safe who I knew would take care of her” said Her mother Destiny Thompson. “Yet they had taken her away from those people and now she was in a shelter wherever she was with people I didn’t know.”Protective Services told Destiny Thompson that she would have to fly to Houston to get her daughter. After many phone calls with various officials Landry Thompson was released back into the custody of her dance instructors.“I would love an apology” said Landry Thompson’s mother. “They owe her an apology.”Soon after the trio was back at the dance studio. They intend to leave Houston on Monday afternoon.The Houston police (HPD) has not been responding to inquiries as to what happened.Were Landry Thompson and dance instructors victims of stereotyping and racism?Why did the Houston police believe they had to react as they did? Does it have anything to do with the young dancer being a young white girl and the two dance instructors being young black males? If the two instructors were white males would the police officers have reacted in the same manner? The dance instructors had notarized document detailing that they were the young girl’s guardian. What else were they expected to do to ensure they would not be treated like common criminals but the productive human beings they are?LIKE My Facebook Page – Visit My Blog:EgbertoWillies.comFollow @EgbertoWillies',\n",
       " \"Story highlights Senior officials say Biden apologized to Obama on Wednesday Obama responded that Biden was speaking from the heart they say Biden's weekend remarks spurred Obama to announce his support for same-sex marriage(CNN) —Vice President Joe Biden has apologized to President Barack Obama for putting him in a tough position that led to Obama’s announcement that he now supports same-sex marriage senior administration officials said Thursday.Obama said in an interview that aired Thursday on ABC that he made his decision public earlier than he had planned after Biden’s weekend remark that he was “absolutely comfortable” with letting gays and lesbians marry.Two senior administration officials said Biden and Obama met Wednesday morning and Biden apologized for putting Obama in a tough spot. Obama responded by saying that he knew Biden was speaking from the heart said the officials who didn’t want to be named discussing private conversations between the president and vice president.Biden’s remarks on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday launched a controversy that led to Obama announcing that his position on same-sex marriage which he had previously called “evolving” had shifted to support. When Obama’s full interview aired Thursday he said his disclosure came sooner than planned as a result of Biden’s comments.“I had already made a decision that we were going to probably take this position before the election and before the convention” Obama said on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” Biden “probably got out a little bit over his skis but out of generosity of spirit” he said.He added that he would have “preferred to have done this in my own way on my own terms” but “all’s well that ends well.”Separately Biden spokeswoman Kendra Barkoff said Obama “has been the leader on this issue from day one and the vice president never intended to distract from that.”Once Biden’s comments drew attention to the issue Obama made plans to announce his support next week on a previously scheduled appearance on the ABC talk show “The View” a senior administration official said Thursday. The president and his advisers knew Obama would be asked about the issue in the wake of Biden’s NBC interview said the official who didn’t want to speak publicly about internal administration discussions.Ultimately they decided to move up the timeline and have him announce his support during the ABC interview at the White House the official said. And a top Democrat told CNN that Obama knew the issue would come up at the convention partly because of a push for support for same-sex marriage to be included in the Democratic Party platform and in debates.Multiple top Democrats told CNN the president’s senior aides are annoyed with Biden for forcing the conversation on same-sex marriage now. One source said Biden has in the past counseled the president against coming out for same-sex marriage making this move that much more frustrating.But the sources said they don’t believe it will create a lasting rift between the two leaders. Biden is known to go off-script something Obama knew when he selected his vice president.In explaining to ABC how his position has evolved Obama noted that his daughters Malia and Sasha have “friends whose parents are same-sex couples. It wouldn’t dawn on them that somehow their friends’ parents would be treated differently. And frankly that’s the kind of thing that prompts a change of perspective not wanting to somehow explain to your child why somebody should be treated differently when it comes to the eyes of the law.”Asked about whether his new position is a calculated move in an election year Obama said it would “be hard to argue that somehow this is something that I’d be doing for political advantage. Because frankly you know the politics – it’s not clear how they cut.”The interview aired the same day Obama attended a fundraiser in Los Angeles where support for same-sex marriage is strong. Movie star George Clooney hosted the event which is raking in $15 million according to a top Democratic source. And on Monday openly gay singer Ricky Martin is hosting a fundraising event for Obama in New York.But some in the African-American community have expressed strong disapproval of Obama’s endorsement of same-sex marriage. A Democratic official said the White House has been actively reaching out to African-American community leaders and pastors and will continue to do so in the wake of the president’s decision but the official noted that even the president’s base won’t always agree with him on everything. “There are going to be issues you don’t agree on” the official said.And Obama told ABC he won’t spend much time talking about the issue because he’s focused on the economy. The announcement puts Obama squarely at odds with presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney who has since reiterated his opposition to same-sex marriage.“And I do not favor civil unions if they are identical to marriage other than by name” Romney said during a Wednesday visit to Fort Lupton Colorado. “My view is the domestic partnership benefits hospital visitation rights and the like are appropriate but that the others are not.”The issue is a divisive one in American politics but it’s uncertain how the development might play out at the voting booth.A Gallup Poll released Tuesday indicated 50% of Americans believe same-sex marriages should be recognized by law as valid with 48% saying such marriages should not be legal – a dramatic shift from a few years ago. A Gallup poll in 2009 found 40% supported same-sex marriage and 57% were opposed.But a CNN/ORC International poll taken in late March indicated policies toward gays and lesbians were tied for last in people’s opinions of the most-important issues facing the country.Obama said he supports states deciding the issue on their own but added that he was “disappointed” by Tuesday’s vote on the issue in North Carolina where a ban on same-sex marriage was added to the constitution. Obama called the amendment discriminatory against gays and lesbians a spokesman said earlier Wednesday.Six states – Massachusetts Connecticut Iowa Vermont New Hampshire and New York – and the District of Columbia issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples while 31 states have voted in favor of constitutional amendments that seek to defend traditional definitions of marriage as a heterosexual union.In February Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire signed a bill that would legalize same-sex marriage beginning in June but opponents there have pledged to block the bill and called for voters to decide the issue. Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley signed into law a bill that permits the state’s same-sex couples to wed as of January 1 and state residents may vote to affirm such a law.Minnesota will vote on a state constitutional amendment similar to the one in North Carolina while Maine will have a referendum on allowing same-sex marriage. Meanwhile two cases seeking to overturn laws forbidding the practice one from California and another from Massachusetts could be headed to the U.S. Supreme Court in coming months.CNN’s Josh Levs Phil Gast Bill Mears Dan Gilgoff and Jim Acosta contributed to this report.\",\n",

       " 'Now the immigration debate is really getting juicy.Rep. Steve King an Iowa Republican has always been a bit of a melon head but he outdid himself in an interview that came to light this week in which he described “DREAMers” — people brought to this country illegally as children — as misshapen drug mules. “For every one who’s a valedictorian there’s another 100 out there that — they weigh 130 pounds and they’ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they’re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert” the honorable gentleman said.Cantaloupe calves? This was a rotten tomato tossed at Latinos who were already suspicious of Republicans before the insult was added to the injury of House conservatives such as King blocking action on bipartisan immigration legislation.“Hateful” said House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio).“Inexcusable” said Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.).1 of 171 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Republicans View Photos A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Caption A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Tom Toles Wait 1 second to continue.King kept on throwing. “It’s not something that I’m making up” he told Radio Iowa on Tuesday evening hours after a Democrat who had discovered the recent interview with Newsmax read the offending comments aloud at a congressional hearing. “We have people that are mules that are drug mules that are hauling drugs across the border and you can tell by their physical characteristics what they’ve been doing for months going through the desert with 75 pounds of drugs on their back. And if those who advocate for the DREAM Act if they choose to characterize this about valedictorians I gave them a different image.”King certainly gave his colleagues a different image: that of a Republican Party driven into extinction in coming decades because it antagonized what is becoming the most important voting bloc. Even his usual conservative partners moved to isolate him.“Irresponsible and reprehensible” Rep. Raul Labrador (Idaho) said at a luncheon gathering with reporters called Conversations with Conservatives. “I think what he said was out of touch with the [GOP] conference.”In lieu of a defense of King Labrador scolded the assembled journalists for their reporting on King’s out-of-his-gourd remark but not the favorable things other Republicans say about immigrants. “Shame on you. Shame on the media” he lectured. “Make sure that your article talks about what every Republican said” Labrador proposed “not what one outlier said.”This is similar to scolding the media for focusing on the one plane that crashes and not giving equal attention to all the planes that land safely. More to the point it’s not at all clear that King is such an outlier.Certainly his zany remarks are low-hanging fruit for journalists. Just last week he got into a heated exchange with a Univision host who asked about a speech in which King likened immigrants to a litter of puppies. “You want a good bird dog?” he asked. “Pick the one that’s the friskiest. . . . You get the pick of the litter and you got yourself a pretty good bird dog. Well we’ve got the pick of every donor civilization on the planet.”But if Republicans think King is a fruitcake they don’t show it on the House floor where last month they approved along party lines an amendment King offered that would force the Obama administration to resume deportation of the DREAMers who immigrated as children. “If this position holds no amnesty will reach the president’s desk” the congressman said in a celebratory statement after the vote.1 of 171 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Republicans View Photos A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Caption A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Tom Toles Wait 1 second to continue.And King’s position is holding. Boehner responding to House conservatives is refusing to take up the Senate legislation. Because he has chosen a strategy of passing legislation through the House without Democratic votes the speaker can’t afford to lose more than a handful of Republicans. This empowers “outliers” such as King.“The reason we’re in a bottleneck here in Congress is because of a few like him” Rep. Rubén Hinojosa (D-Tex.) chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus told me Wednesday afternoon at a caucus event outside the Capitol. “Evidently there’s enough to be able to force the speaker of the House to stall and not be able to do this immigration reform.”Republicans say their objections to the immigration bill have nothing to do with racial or ethnic discrimination and that’s surely the case for most of them. But King makes it easy for Democrats to tar the Republicans with sinister motives. Rep. Ben Luján (D-N.M.) one of several speakers denouncing King on the House floor Wednesday said his slur shows why “the American people continue to see House Republicans as out of touch.”That’s not quite fair. But when one of their own is talking about cantaloupe calves Republicans aren’t in a strong position to complain about cherry-picking.Twitter: @MilbankRead more from Dana Milbank’s archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON — President Obama expanding his push to curtail severe penalties in drug cases on Thursday commuted the sentences of eight federal inmates who were convicted of crack cocaine offenses. Each inmate has been imprisoned for at least 15 years and six were sentenced to life in prison.It was the first time retroactive relief was provided to a group of inmates who would most likely have received significantly shorter terms if they had been sentenced under current drug laws sentencing rules and charging policies. Most will be released in 120 days. The commutations opened a major new front in the administration’s efforts to curb soaring taxpayer spending on prisons and to help correct what it has portrayed as inequality in the justice system.In a statement Mr. Obama said that each of the eight men and women had been sentenced under what is now recognized as an “unfair system” including a 100-to-1 sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine offenses that was significantly reduced by the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010.“If they had been sentenced under the current law many of them would have already served their time and paid their debt to society” Mr. Obama said. “Instead because of a disparity in the law that is now recognized as unjust they remain in prison separated from their families and their communities at a cost of millions of taxpayer dollars each year.”',\n",

       " 'Bill Maher’s New Rules on the plea to raise the minimum wage is on point. It is hard to understand anyone’s objection to it. A country cannot frown on citizen’s using public assistance if it does not create an economy that pays a living wage to all its citizens that are working.The following snippet with the most relevant bullets from his New Rules segment on the minimum wage is on point.Bill Maher’s New Rules Snippet On The Minimum Wage When it comes to raising the minimum wage Conservatives always say it is a non-starter because it cuts into profits. … You might think that paying people enough to live is so self-evident that even crazy people could understand it. But you would be wrong. … Michele Bachmann is not only against raising the minimum wage she is against having one at all. She wants said “… if we took away the minimum wage … we could … virtually wipe out unemployment … because we would be able to offer jobs at whatever level.” … And naturally Ted Cruz agrees. Ted Cruz thinks it’s a good thing that when his Cuban father came to America he was paid fifty cents an hour to work as a dishwasher. … When did the American dream become this pathway to indentured servitude this economic death spiral where workers get paid next to nothing so they can only afford to buy next to nothing so businesses are forced to sell cheaper and cheaper shit? Consider the fact that most fast food workers whose average age by the way is 29 … are on some form of public assistance which is not surprising. When even working people can’t make enough to live they take money from the government. This is the question the Right has to answer. Do you want smaller government with less handouts or do you want do you want a low minimum wage because you cannot have both. If Coronel Sanders isn’t going to pay the lady behind the counter enough to live on then Uncle Sam has to. And I for one is getting a little tired of helping highly profitable companies pay their workers.Bill Maher makes a very important statement. The average American citizens are subsidizing McDonald’s. Americans are subsidizing all companies that are paying below subsistence level wages.The viral story of a McDonald’s employee calling a McDonald’s help line is probative. McDonald’s gave her information necessary to get government assistance and charity. This was a full time worker. What she really needs is an increase in the minimum wage. What she needs is the dignity of pay she can live on.Bill Maher is late to the party. George Carlin figured out long time ago that the American Dream had become a pathway to indentured servitude. He laid it out in his “The American Dream” standup skit. The minimum wage is part of the problem. However the problem of the poor and working middle class is much deeper.The problem is income and wealth disparity that is getting worse. Income and growth is extracted from the poor and the middle class with policies to ensure the incessant steady growth of the wealth and income of a very few.LIKE My Facebook Page – Visit My Blog: EgbertoWillies.comFollow @EgbertoWillies',\n",
       " 'My connection to her comes from the darkest days of Occupy Wall Street when activists were being arrested and brutalized the city was engaged in illegal shenanigans to harass folks at Zuccotti Park and even Netroots New York was nearly cancelled because of our association with occupiers. As a leader in the National Lawyers Guild Kurland was tireless in defending the civil and political rights of New Yorkers and earned a respect in all the circles she traveled in - labor lgbt civil rights healthcare neighborhood activists and the legal community.Two communities she failed to impress include real estate and Wall St. So no one was surprised with Corey Johnson a hollow candidate if there ever was one entered the race with Christine Quinn\\'s blessing. Reading his resume you might be impressed with his public track record of activism. One thing stands out though: no mention of how he earns a living.It\\'s easy to understand why. As CityCouncilWatch.net reports\"What it turns out he is covering up and scrubbing from his Internet presence is his work as Director of Governmental Relations and Community Affairs for GFI Development Company beginning in July 2008. GFI Development is the real estate development branch of GFI Group which according to the company website “has been at the forefront of credit derivative brokerage services leadership that we are now leveraging to help establish an active liquid Exotic Credit Derivative market.” Exotic credit derivatives for those among us with short memories are those quaint financial instruments that enable banks to make massive bets on the failure of loans without having to actually own any of the underlying debt. Credit derivatives caused a minor kerfuffle in the markets in late 2008. GFI Group “handled as much as 40 percent of the credit-derivatives trades between the world\\'s banks in 2007” according to Bloomberg. Well Corey Johnson had nothing to do with any of that of course…he worked for the real estate development arm of GFI. And real estate development firms are wholesome salubrious entities. Which must be why after I asked Johnson’s campaign manger about his work there his speaker bio at the Gay Center website was scrubbed. (Compare here and here.) And his LinkedIn profile was closed.To recap not only is Kurland a fantastic candidate worthy of our support but she\\'s running against the recession era caricature of pure unadulterated evil: a real estate lobbyist in Manhattan working for the leader in the \\'exotic derivatives\\' industry. A starker choice could not be made.Visit Yetta Kurland for Council.Full disclosure: I don\\'t live in Kurland\\'s district but I love her.

       " 'In the public relations push for his takeover of the American health care system President Obama promised that those who like their insurance could keep it premiums would decrease and no one would lose their doctor. We know now those were all lies told repeatedly and never questioned by a media that is still looking the other way. Another promise Obama made was that ObamaCare would not fund abortions. LifeNews reports that this was also a lie:The ObamaCare statute specifically requires the issuers of Exchange plans that cover abortion to “collect from each enrollee in the plan” a “separate payment” for the type of abortions for which funding is prohibited under the Hyde Amendment (which is all abortions other than in cases of life of the mother rape or incest) and a separate payment for all other services. [42 U.S.C. 18023(b)]. These separate payments are then to be deposited into separate accounts.During the regulatory process commenters questioned HHS on how this was to be implemented and according to HHS the commenters “recommended that HHS clarify . . . whether [Exchange plan] issuers may satisfy the separate payment provision by providing each enrollee with an itemized bill and whether an enrollee’s coverage would be terminated for failure to comply with the separate payment provision.” Rather than doing so HHS merely said that the comments would be taken into consideration in any future guidance. [77 Fed. Reg. 18430 (March 27 2012)].Now despite the clear language of the ObamaCare statute it appears that the separate check requirement is not going to be enforced by the Obama Administration. Gretchen Borchelt director of state reproductive health policy at the National Women’s Law Center told the Huffington Post that “we used to talk about it as being two checks that the consumer would have to write because of the segregation requirements but that’s not the way it’s being implemented.” (Huffington Post Sept. 3 2013).Likewise a spokeswoman for Rhode Island’s Exchange told PolitiFact Rhode Island that “the customer is not billed a separate fee.” (Politifact Oct. 2 2013. The Rhode Island Exchange will handle the billing not the plan issuers). As PolitiFact notes “it turns out to be a hidden fee.”There is nothing the media is willing to make Obama pay a political price for. Not even repeatedly lying to millions who are about to lose their insurance or forcing people to violate their conscience over the abomination of abortion.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC',\n",
       " 'I promised one graph - but lets look at one more. Let\\'s compare labor\\'s share of income to the S&P 500 since 2000.Two things to note - the stock market is going up while labor\\'s share is going down. I don\\'t think is a a real surprise but the graph shows the cause pretty well. But there is a second point I want to make as well. In addition to a lack of demand a world where the rich have too much money is a world that is going to be subject to asset bubbles. If the rich don\\'t spend their money it is going to go somewhere. That somewhere is in part various financial markets. But because financial markets are prone to panic I think you can predict that we will see more bubbles build and then burst.The graph suggests at least in part that my second point is true is well.There are many conclusions you can draw on this. Some here will say that this is a house of cards that will all come crashing down. I don\\'t think this is really right for a variety of reasons. But I DO think that until something happens to change the balance of power between labor and capital the economy will not perform as it could and the fruits of that economy will be very unequally distributed.I close with Marriner Eccles\\' (the head of the Fed under FDR) famous explanation of the cause of the Great Depression. His words ring true today:As mass production has to be accompanied by mass consumption mass consumption in turn implies a distribution of wealth -- not of existing wealth but of wealth as it is currently produced -- to provide men with buying power equal to the amount of goods and services offered by the nation\\'s economic machinery. [Emphasis in original.] Instead of achieving that kind of distribution a giant suction pump had by 1929-30 drawn into a few hands an increasing portion of currently produced wealth. This served them as capital accumulations. But by taking purchasing power out of the hands of mass consumers the savers denied to themselves the kind of effective demand for their products that would justify a reinvestment of their capital accumulations in new plants. In consequence as in a poker game where the chips were concentrated in fewer and fewer hands the other fellows could stay in the game only by borrowing. When their credit ran out the game stopped.Since this is on the reclist I thought I would point people to a very wonkish - but still important piece by Brad Delong this morning. Delong is pretty much required reading if you want to understand the economy - he was one of the leaders of the attacks on Reinhart and Rogoff.He notes in part about the incredible gap between corporate profits and the Treasury rate:\"Right now the profit share in the US economy is at levels far and away higher than I at least ever imagined I would see. And given the high profit share and the extremely low return on Treasury notes the stock market is far and away lower than I at least ever imagined I would see. With downward pressure on real wages from elevated unemployment making it more likely that profits will grow faster than the economy rather than shrink the 9% point gap between the S&P earnings yield of 7% and the Treasury note real yield of -2%--I never thought I would see anything like this in my lifetime.\"',\n",

He predicted that a system that is launched using photos would later be expanded to include other identifiers people might see as more problematic including iris scans and fingerprints. But he said the \"knitting together\" of available sources of photographs into a single database is itself a concern.\"I’m standing down on the horizon waving my arms saying  \\'Hey hey this is a national ID system!\" he said. \"It\\'s big government at it\\'s worst.\"Still many immigration advocates have shelved their long-time opposition to E-Verify believing it one piece of a necessary compromise that will also allow a path to citizenship for those now in the country illegally. The system they believe is necessary to convince wary conservatives that the nation will not face a new flood of illegal immigrants once a path to citizenship is provided for many who are already here.Frank Sharry executive director of America\\'s Voice said a new system to reduce incentives for employers to hire illegal immigrants — and make it harder for them to do so — is a key piece of any broad-based overhaul of the system.\"It\\'s the essential trade-off: legalization and a path to citizenship for employer verification\" he said. \"That is really the heart of every comprehensive immigration reform package ever put together.\"',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON — The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was conceived by a Harvard professor embraced by the Obama administration and pushed into law by Congressional Democrats determined to expand the federal government’s authority to protect borrowers from abusive lending practices — all in the space of just three years.But even after the agency opened its doors in July 2011 almost exactly two years ago its legal authority remained uncertain so long as Republicans prevented the confirmation of a director to lead the agency as required by law.That barricade collapsed on Tuesday.

       " 'TUCSON — An Arizona law that put an end to ethnic studies courses in Tucson schools has been largely upheld as constitutional by a federal judge but supporters of the program say their legal fight to restore the program will continue.U.S. Circuit Court Judge Wallace Tashima on Friday found most of the law that bans public schools from teaching certain race-related courses such as Mexican American studies constitutional with one small exception. Tashima ruled that the portion of the law that prohibits courses designed for certain ethnic groups was unconstitutionally vague.AdvertisementTashima ruled that the provision’s wording was “broad and ambiguous” raising serious constitutional concerns that threaten “to chill the teaching of legitimate and objective ethnic studies courses.”Still Arizona Atty. Gen. Tom Horne this week called the ruling on HB 2281 a “victory for ensuring that public education is not held captive to radical political elements and that students treat each other as individuals — not on the basis of the race they were born into.”AdvertisementHorne who wrote the law and those who support it said the Mexican American Studies Program in the Tucson school system promoted resentment toward a race or a class of people and advocated ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of people as individuals.Defenders of the program rejected that characterization and said it taught often neglected aspects of U.S. history and inspired Latino students to excel in school.AdvertisementTrustees of the Tucson Unified School District discontinued the program in January 2012 after state officials determined the program violated the new law.The Save Ethnic Studies group based in Tucson declared the case “not over.” Richard Martinez an attorney who filed suit against the law acknowledged Tuesday that the legal road ahead would probably be long and steep.AdvertisementStill he said the group would forge ahead.“Too much is at stake. The right of every student to learn and teacher to teach the history literature and culture of Latinos in Arizona is currently prohibited” the group said in a statement Monday. “Mexican American Studies proved to be a valuable educational program.”AdvertisementIn his ruling Tashima stated that the arguments made against the law “do not meet the high threshold needed to establish a constitutional violation.”Although the judge said the program’s defenders failed to show discriminatory intent he found that several aspects of the law and the public debate about it “may be viewed to spark suspicion that the Latino population has been improperly targeted.”Advertisement“This single-minded focus on terminating the [Mexican American studies] program along with Horne’s decision not to issue findings against other ethnic studies programs is at least suggestive of discriminatory intent” Tashima wrote.Several students and teachers in the district challenged the law on several grounds including that it violated free speech and is unconstitutionally vague.Advertisementcindy.carcamo@latimes.comALSO:AdvertisementNew York’s ‘cannibal cop’ is convictedJudge blocks NYC ban on large sugary drinksAdvertisementHarvard faculty outraged after administration spies on emails',\n",
       " 'In a commencement address in Atlanta on Sunday to graduating seniors at Morehouse College President Barack Obama told graduates to fulfill the “special obligation I felt as a black man like you.” The all-male historically black liberal arts college was also the alma mater of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. among other famous graduates.The president told the graduating students that their background meant they had a duty “to create greater justice both in your own community but also across our country. To make sure everyone has a voice; everyone gets a seat at the table; to make sure that everyone – no matter what they look like or where they come from or who they love – gets a chance to walk through those doors of opportunity if they want it bad enough.”Obama cited his own life as an example several times during his speech touting his success as a father while also acknowledging some “bad choices” he made in his youth–a veiled reference to his admitted past drug use which Obama has often acknowledged in books speeches and debates.He also admonished Morehouse graduates who aimed to join the professions that they ought to serve the poor:So yes go get that law degree. But ask yourself if the only option is to defend the rich and powerful or if you can also find time to defend the powerless. Yes go get your MBA or start that business. But ask yourself what broader purpose your business might serve in putting people to work or transforming a neighborhood….Some of you may be headed to medical school to become doctors. But make sure you heal folks in underserved communities who really need it too.(Here the president did not mention his own rather unique career path as an attorney which included defending landlords in large urban housing developments who had evicted tenants in winter or failed to provide necessary services.)In one portion of his speech the president touted Obamacare–and encouraged the graduates to sign up for the new health insurance exchanges created by his signature legislation.Obama seems to have been carrying out the advice of Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel brother of Obama’s former chief of staff who argued recently in the Wall Street Journal that young Americans would have to be targeted by a propaganda campaign if the system were not to be dangerously underfunded: “Every commencement address by an administration official should encourage young graduates to get health insurance” Dr. Emanuel wrote.Obama advised the graduating class that racism could no longer be leaned upon as a reason for failure: “We’ve got no time for excuses” he said. He also acknowledged that the U.S. had become tolerant enough to elect a black president. And yet Obama described a nation in which discrimination is still rampant:See as Morehouse Men many of you know what it’s like to be an outsider; to be marginalized; to feel the sting of discrimination. That’s an experience that so many other Americans share. Hispanic Americans know that feeling when someone asks where they come from or tells them to go back. Gay and lesbian Americans feel it when a stranger passes judgment on their parenting skills or the love they share. Muslim Americans feel it when they’re stared at with suspicion because of their faith. Any woman who knows the injustice of earning less pay for doing the same work – she sure feels it.The premise of Obama’s claim is at odds with recent global survey data which indicates that the U.S. is among the least racist countries in the world. It is also at odds with the record of his own political career. In the recent past President Obama has been guilty of many of the sins described above–touting deportations of illegal immigrants; opposing gay marriage until a year ago; moving Muslims out of campaign photographs for fear of arousing prejudice; and most notoriously paying women less than men in both his Senate and White House offices.Overall President Obama’s remarks repeated a pattern of recent graduation speeches in which he minimized individual achievement in favor of collective obligation.Curiously he barely mentioned government which he has been at great pains to defend in some recent addresses–speeches that have drawn wider criticism in the wake of recent scandals involving abuses of government power.The word “government” appeared five times in his recent Ohio State commencement speech but not once in the Morehouse address where the only mentions of government careers were his own presidency and the Atlanta mayoralty of Maynard Jackson.Obama’s emphasis at Morehouse was on voluntary service to the community–a theme closer to the American philosophical tradition albeit reformulated to suit the policies and prerogatives of the administration and the Democratic Party.',\n",
       " \"Highlighting the importance of the African American vote in the May 21 mayoral runoff Wendy Greuel and Eric Garcetti held dueling news conferences in South Los Angeles on Thursday to tout new endorsements from highly sought black leaders. At various points some of the participants even got a little testy.Basketball legend Magic Johnson backed Greuel saying that he selected the city controller because of her broad range of experience in the public and private sectors her longtime ties to the African American community and the historic nature of her candidacy to be the city’s first female mayor.Advertisement“We love this woman because she loves us. We love this woman because she’s been in our community many many years and the fact that she’s going to get the job done” Johnson said standing alongside a broad cross-section of religious civic and elected leaders at a church on Crenshaw Boulevard.L.A. ELECTIONS 2013: Sign up for our email newsletterAdvertisement“Wendy I am in your campaign ready to go door-to-door with you” he said. “We want to make sure you are the next mayor. We’re going to make history like we did for President Obama.”Garcetti meanwhile picked up the backing of City Councilwoman Jan Perry who said she chose her fellow council member because of his track record — and to send a message to special interests that spent millions of dollars supporting Greuel in the primary.Advertisement“There has been and there will be a tremendous amount of money donated to one candidate in this race from various special interests and I believe that we need to take a stand to let everyone know that the city of Los Angeles cannot be bought” said Perry who unsuccessfully ran for mayor this year.FULL COVERAGE: L.A.'s race for mayorAdvertisementAlthough Perry did not mention Greuel by name in her remarks she could not hide her disdain for the controller as she took questions from reporters. During the primary Greuel slashed at Perry’s personal financial background in the closing days of the race. Greuel called her after the primary and Perry said she did not return the call. She paraphrased poet Maya Angelou in explaining why: “Dr. Angelou says ‘Thank you for letting me know who you are.’ So I’m clear. I understand. I got the memo. It was clear to me that I didn’t need to engage in any false pretenses because that’s not who I am” Perry said.“The memo says I do not respect you and that I respect you so little that I would delve into your personal background and then mischaracterize it to boot and then buy time with my own campaign money and put it on websites all over the country” Perry said. “Instead of dealing with substance she went to the personal. That was not necessary.”AdvertisementGreuel brushed off the criticism.“We are public figures. Everything we are doing is [an] open book as people are making choices about the future” she told reporters after her news conference. “I received a lot of blows during this campaign during the beginning. This is for the public to decide.”AdvertisementEarlier while thanking Johnson for his endorsement she flubbed the sport played by the former Lakers point guard who is now part-owner of the Dodgers.“It is so important to me be endorsed by Magic Johnson who has been giving back to this community all his life” she said. “We know a lot of celebrities come and go. This celebrity this leader has been a person who has stayed in this community and given back.”Advertisement“I grew up Magic watching you play baseball” Greuel said as the crowd interrupted to correct her that Johnson had played basketball.“You did everything right I thought baseball too. See I was thinking Dodgers today. Yay Dodgers!” she said clapping her hands. “He can do everything. So five NBA championships new ownership for the Dodgers millions invested in our community and an inspiration for Angelenos all across Los Angeles on dealing with the issue of AIDS. And [he has] been an amazing friend particularly here in South Los Angeles. You have never forgotten.”AdvertisementGarcetti said he was “so very proud” to receive Perry’s nod saying that the councilwoman brought a strong independent voice to the mayoral primary and the two shared a passion for revitalizing communities block by block.“There’s a clear difference in this race. While others are running on rhetoric we’re a campaign of results. Voters can see the results themselves” Garcetti said. “No matter how many attacks people made against Jan or me just walk the streets of our districts just see the jobs on the streets the cranes downtown the cranes in Hollywood…. That’s what Jan Perry and I are going to do together when I am mayor … in South Los Angeles and citywide.”AdvertisementPerry came in fourth in the primary receiving nearly 16% of the vote with heavy support among African American voters in South Los Angeles. If those supporters vote as a bloc in the runoff it could place Garcetti or Greuel within grasp of victory.Since the March 5 primary the candidates have been heavily competing to roll out endorsements with Greuel snagging former President Bill Clinton on Monday. Garcetti and Perry on Thursday questioned the value of Greuel’s big-name endorsers such as Clinton and Johnson questioning what kind of influence they have with city voters — church groups neighborhood councils and the like — as they make a decision.Advertisement“I admire Magic Johnson very much. He’s a great role model he’s a tremendous athlete he’s a great businessman he’s a very wealthy man a member of the Guggenheim organization. And you know I don’t know if I’d call that grass-roots but it’s OK” Perry said. “And I’m happy that he’s wealthy. I have a lot of love for him.”Johnson bristled at this remark saying that he has deep long-standing ties to South Los Angeles.Advertisement“I’m not a celebrity. I’m a man of this community and a businessman and so people know that” he told reporters. “I’m the one who started all this business. When you look on Crenshaw I started that with that Starbucks down there.”“I’m the one who started redevelopment in South Los Angeles not Jan Perry. I did it” he said. “I love Jan. She’s a good person and she did a wonderful job with what she did downtown but in L.A. South L.A. I’m the one.”AdvertisementLate in the day primary contender Kevin James — who finished third just ahead of Perry — emailed his backers asking them to recommend whom if anyone he should endorse.seema.mehta@latimes.com\",\n",
       " 'Arizona officials said they will continue to use state voter registration forms that require a prospective voter to prove citizenship despite a Supreme Court ruling that struck down the requirement on federal forms.Hours after voting rights advocates were hailing Monday’s Supreme Court decision officials indicated that Arizona will take advantage of a provision in the ruling allowing the state to seek to continue requiring the added documentation while it appeals to a federal agency. In effect the Supreme Court’s ruling which was viewed as a step forward in national voter registration law could have a less of an immediate impact within the state.Advertisement“The next step is going to the EAC” Arizona Atty. Gen. Tom Horne said of the federal Elections Assistance Commission the agency that developed the federal form. After that agency the state can go back to the courts where the state believes it can win and get to keep the requirement of added documentation on citizenship Horne said in a telephone interview with the Los Angeles Times.“The state form will not change only the federal form” Matthew Roberts director of communications for Arizona Secretary of State Ken Bennett said in a telephone interview. Roberts said officials will continue distributing the Arizona form which is used for about 95% of all voter registration. Only about 5% of the registrations come via the federal form he said.AdvertisementThe decision by state officials was expected since Arizona has been fighting for the tougher requirements for years. Local advocates however had earlier said they hoped to work with the state to revise the Arizona registration form in light of the Supreme Court ruling.“We certainly hope our election officials would not continue to fight this” said Sam Wercinski executive director of the Arizona Advocacy network one of the groups involved in seeking to overturn the Arizona citizenship requirements. “This is a very clear decision” he said in a conference call by several groups involved in the case.AdvertisementEarlier Monday the Supreme Court announced that it had had thrown out Arizona’s requirement that a prospective voter show proof of citizenship. It ruled against Arizona 7-2 in Arizona vs. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona Inc. The court said that the state policy approved by voters as Proposition 200 in 2004 was at odds with the 1993 National Voter Registration Act also known as the “motor voter” law.The federal law was designed to increase participation particularly among minorities by making it more convenient for people to sign up to vote by filling out a form when getting a driver’s license for example. On the federal form the applicant has to swear that he is a citizen under penalty of perjury. But Arizona went one step further requiring proof of citizenship such as a passport or birth certificate.AdvertisementAdvocates sued arguing that the federal form didn’t require such documentation and should be the standard. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that National Voter Registration Act is the controlling law rather than Proposition 200. The case eventually went to the Supreme Court.Federal law “precludes Arizona from requiring a federal form applicant to submit information beyond that required by the form itself” Justice Antonia Scalia wrote for the court’s majority. In his ruling however Scalia said the state could continue to make a case before the federal agency and depending on that ruling again appeal to the courts.Advertisement“I think the court has given us a clear path to victory” Atty. Gen. Horne said. He argued that the court affirmed the right of states to set their own standards for voting.Opponents of the Arizona law said they see it as an effort to limit participation by minorities and immigrants. In the conference call they said more than 31000 potential voters were blocked from registering. Voter registration through community-based drives dropped by 44% in Arizona’s largest county Maricopa according to Maldef the Latino civil rights group.Advertisement“We don’t think it will be successful” Nina Perales Maldef’s vice president for litigation said of Arizona’s continuing effort to fight for its law. She argued that the state had a chance to provide documentation that the added requirements were needed but had failed to do so.“Proposition 200 was a new starting point in the war on voters in Arizona” Wercinski said.Advertisement“Individuals want to register and vote” he said during the conference call. “Opponents have tried to increase barriers over and over again.... When people register they will vote.”For groups opposed to the Arizona law including the ACLU and the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law Monday’s ruling was major step forward.Advertisement“Today’s decision is a significant victory for U.S. citizens and their ability to register to vote without burdensome requirements” said Wade Henderson president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. “In our democracy if you don’t vote you don’t count and the Arizona law was a blatant effort to keep some citizens from making their voice heard in our elections.”ALSO:AdvertisementNYU denies it is evicting Chen GuangchengWorst is over in Colorado fires officials sayAdvertisementWhitey Bulger trial resumes with an ex-hit man due on standmichael.muskal@latimes.com',\n",
       " 'Blow\\'s final two paragraphs which come immediately after referencing Bibeau read as follows:That is because as Talking Points Memo says “Obama voters would have received almost exactly 3/5 of the electoral vote compared to their actual population — 30.7 percent of the electoral vote over 51 percent of the popular vote.” This is not where we should be in 2013 debating whether to pass bills to reduce urban voters to a fraction of the value of other voters and hoping that someone with the power to stop it thinks it’s a “bad idea.”The bill will not become law in Virginia. A key Republican state senator opposes it so it might not even get out of committee in the state senate; the Lt. Gov opposes it and since he has already said he will not break 20-20 ties that are strictly partisan (and the senate is split 20-20 between the two parties) even if it reached the floor he seems committed to killing it; and the Governor opposes it so even were it to reach his desk he seems committed to vetoing it.It is worth noting that unlike the two states that now distribute electoral votes by Congressional district (Maine which has never split and Nebraska which in 2008 gave on e EV to OBama) and as far as I know ALL other current proposals rather than giving the two EV votes equivalent to the two senators to the candidate winning the statewide total the Virginia proposal would award the final two EVS to the candidate winning the majority of the Congressional districts not the majority of the state\\'s votes. Those districts were heavily gerrymandered because in 2008 the Dems had won 6 of the state\\'s electoral votes and even though Glenn Nye and Tom Perriello and Rick Boucher were defeated in 2010 the Republicans were taking no chances and redrew the CDs to make them more Republican friendly. Obama actually won one CD represented by a Republican.The proposal came from a state senator whose intention seems racist - he wants rural (for which you can read \"white\") voters not to be outvoted by urban (for which you can read \"black\" and to a lesser degree \"Hispanic\") voters.It will not go anywhere.It is ironic that the vote distribution turned out to so closely match the ratio of the 3/5 Compromise.But then part of the pushback against Obama has from the beginning been because he was Black.Odd that the ratio would now increasingly include young people and women as well as people of color.Again it won\\'t happen in Virginia.It seems like the parallel in Florida is also dead because the Republican heads of the two chambers of the state legislature are opposed to splitting the electoral vote.But let\\'s be clear - the intent of such proposal is not merely to steal states for Republicans that they might not otherwise win it is to diminish the value of the votes of minorities and expand the power of angry old white men.Like the attempts this past cycle at voter suppression through voter-id laws and limiting access to early voting this will produce a backlash.Perhaps those pushing such proposals really do want to make Obama voters count for only 3/5.In the process what they might be demonstrating is that they themselves have only 3/5 the intelligence and moral character of those whose votes they seek to diminish.',\n",

       " 'Tom Edsall on politics inside and outside of Washington.Although there was plenty of discussion during the 2012 presidential campaign about the Hispanic vote and how intense black turnout would be the press was preoccupied with the white vote: the white working class white women and upscale whites.Largely missing from daily news stories were references to research on how racial attitudes have changed under Obama the nation’s first black president. In fact there has been an interesting exploration of this subject among academics but before getting to that let’s look back at some election results.In the 16 presidential elections between 1952 and 2012 only one Democratic candidate Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 won a majority of the white vote. There have been nine Democratic presidential nominees who received a smaller percentage of the white vote than Obama did in 2008 (43 percent) and four who received less white support than Obama did in 2012 (39 percent).In 2012 Obama won 39 percent of the white electorate. Four decades earlier in 1972 George McGovern received a record-setting low of the ballots cast by whites 31 percent. In 1968 Hubert Humphrey won 36 percent of the white vote; in 1980 Jimmy Carter got 33 percent; in 1984 Walter Mondale took 35 percent of the ballots cast by whites. As far back as 1956 Adlai Stevenson tied Obama’s 39 percent and in 1952 Stevenson received 40 percent – both times running against Dwight D. Eisenhower. Two Democratic nominees from Massachusetts Michael Dukakis in 1988 (40 percent) and John Kerry in 2004 (41 percent) got white margins only slightly higher than Obama’s in 2012 — and worse than Obama’s 43 percent in 2008. In other words Obama’s track record with white voters is not very different from that of other Democratic candidates.Ballots cast for House candidates provide another measure of white partisanship. These contests have been tracked in exit polls from 1980 onward. Between 1980 and 1992 the white vote for Democratic House candidates averaged 49.6 percent. It dropped sharply in 1994 when Newt Gingrich orchestrated the Republican take-over of the House averaging just 42.7 percent from 1994 through 2004. White support for Democrats rose to an average of 46.7 percent in 2006 and 2008 as public disapproval of George W. Bush and of Republicans in Congress sharply increased.How can the percentage of people holding anti-black attitudes have increased from 2006 to 2008 at a time when Obama performed better among white voters than the two previous white Democratic nominees and then again from 2008 to 2012 when Obama won a second term?In the aftermath of Obama’s election white support for Congressional Democrats collapsed to its lowest level in the history of House exit polling 38 percent in 2010 — at once driving and driven by the emerging Tea Party. In 2012 white Democratic support for House candidates remained weak at 39 percent.Despite how controversial it has been to talk about race researchers have gathered a substantial amount of information on the opinions of white American voters.The political scientists Michael Tesler of Brown University and David O. Sears of UCLA have published several studies on this theme and they have also written a book “Obama’s Race: The 2008 Election and the Dream of a Post-Racial America” that analyzes changes in racial attitudes since Obama became the Democratic nominee in 2008.In their 2010 paper “President Obama and the Growing Polarization of Partisan Attachments by Racial Attitudes and Race” Tesler and Sears argue that theevidence strongly suggests that party attachments have become increasingly polarized by both racial attitudes and race as a result of Obama’s rise to prominence within the Democratic Party.Specifically Tesler and Sears found that voters high on a racial-resentment scale moved one notch toward intensification of partisanship within the Republican Party on a seven-point scale from strong Democrat through independent to strong Republican.To measure racial resentment which Tesler and Sears describe as “subtle hostility towards African-Americans” the authors used data from the American National Election Studies and the General Social Survey an extensive collection of polling data maintained at the University of Chicago.In the case of A.N.E.S. data Tesler and Sears write:The scale was constructed from how strongly respondents agreed or disagreed with the following assertions: 1) Irish Italian Jewish and many other minorities overcame prejudice and worked their way up. Blacks should do the same without any special favors. 2) Generations of slavery and discrimination have created conditions that make it difficult for blacks to work their way out of the lower class. 3) Over the past few years blacks have gotten less than they deserve. 4) It’s really a matter of some people not trying hard enough; if blacks would only try harder they could be just as well off as whites.The General Social Survey included questions asking respondents to rate competing causes of racial discrimination and inequality:The scale was constructed from responses to the following 4 items: 1) Irish Italian Jewish and many other minorities overcame prejudice and worked their way up. Blacks should do the same without any special favors. 2) A 3-category variable indicating whether respondents said lack of motivation is or is not a reason for racial inequality. 3) A 3-category variable indicating whether respondents said discrimination is or is not a reason for racial inequality. 4) A three-category variable indicating whether respondents rated whites more less or equally hardworking than blacks on 7 point stereotype scales.Supporting the Tesler-Sears findings Josh Pasek a professor in the communication studies department at the University of Michigan Jon A. Krosnick a political scientist at Stanford and Trevor Tompson the director of the Associated Press-National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago use responses from three different surveys in their analysis of “The Impact of Anti-Black Racism on Approval of Barack Obama’s Job Performance and on Voting in the 2012 Presidential Election.”Pasek and his collaborators found a statistically significant increase from 2008 to 2012 in “explicit anti-black attitudes” – a measure based on questions very similar those used by Tesler and Sears for their racial-resentment scale. The percentage of voters with explicit anti-black attitudes rose from 47.6 in 2008 and 47.3 percent in 2010 to 50.9 percent in 2012.Crucially Pasek found that Republicans drove the change: “People who identified themselves as Republicans in 2012 expressed anti-Black attitudes more often than did Republican identifiers in 2008.”In 2008 Pasek and his collaborators note the proportion of people expressing anti-Black attitudes was 31 percent among Democrats 49 percent among independents and 71 percent among Republicans. By 2012 the numbers had gone up. “The proportion of people expressing anti-Black attitudes” they write “was 32 percent among Democrats 48 percent among independents and 79 percent among Republicans.”At the moment the population of the United States (314 million) is heading towards a majority-minority status in 2042.The American electorate on the other hand (126 million) is currently 72 percent white based on the voters who cast ballots last November.Obama’s ascendency to the presidency means that on race the Rubicon has been crossed (2008) and re-crossed (2012).What are we to make of these developments? Is the country more or less racist? How can the percentage of people holding anti-black attitudes have increased from 2006 to 2008 at a time when Obama performed better among white voters than the two previous white Democratic nominees and then again from 2008 to 2012 when Obama won a second term?In fact the shifts described by Tesler and Pasek are an integral aspect of the intensifying conservatism within the right wing of the Republican Party. Many voters voicing stronger anti-black affect were already Republican. Thus in 2012 shifts in their attitudes while they contributed to a 4 percentage point reduction in Obama’s white support did not result in a Romney victory.Some Republican strategists believe the party’s deepening conservatism is scaring away voters.“We have a choice: we can become a shrinking regional party of middle-aged and older white men or we can fight to become a national governing party” John Weaver a consultant to the 2008 McCain campaign said after Obama’s re-election. Mark McKinnon an adviser to former President George W. Bush made a similar point: “The party needs more tolerance more diversity and a deeper appreciation for the concerns of the middle class.”Not only is the right risking marginalization as its views on race have become more extreme it is veering out of the mainstream on contraception and abortion positions that fueled an 11 point gender gap in 2012 and a 13 point gap in 2008.Given that a majority of the electorate will remain white for a number of years the hurdle that the Republican Party faces is building the party’s white margins by 2 to 3 points. For Romney to have won he needed 62 percent of the white vote not the 59 percent he got.Working directly against this goal is what Time Magazine recently described as the Republican “brand identity that has emerged from the stars of the conservative media ecosystem: Rush Limbaugh Sean Hannity Bill O’Reilly Ann Coulter and others.”It is not so much Latino and black voters that the Republican Party needs. To win the White House again it must assuage the social conscience of mainstream moderate white voters among whom an ethos of tolerance has become normal. These voters are concerned with fairness and diversity even as they stand to the right of center. It is there that the upcoming political battles — on the gamut of issues from race to rights — will be fought.',\n",
       " 'Blow\\'s final two paragraphs which come immediately after referencing Bibeau read as follows:That is because as Talking Points Memo says “Obama voters would have received almost exactly 3/5 of the electoral vote compared to their actual population — 30.7 percent of the electoral vote over 51 percent of the popular vote.” This is not where we should be in 2013 debating whether to pass bills to reduce urban voters to a fraction of the value of other voters and hoping that someone with the power to stop it thinks it’s a “bad idea.”The bill will not become law in Virginia. A key Republican state senator opposes it so it might not even get out of committee in the state senate; the Lt. Gov opposes it and since he has already said he will not break 20-20 ties that are strictly partisan (and the senate is split 20-20 between the two parties) even if it reached the floor he seems committed to killing it; and the Governor opposes it so even were it to reach his desk he seems committed to vetoing it.It is worth noting that unlike the two states that now distribute electoral votes by Congressional district (Maine which has never split and Nebraska which in 2008 gave on e EV to OBama) and as far as I know ALL other current proposals rather than giving the two EV votes equivalent to the two senators to the candidate winning the statewide total the Virginia proposal would award the final two EVS to the candidate winning the majority of the Congressional districts not the majority of the state\\'s votes. Those districts were heavily gerrymandered because in 2008 the Dems had won 6 of the state\\'s electoral votes and even though Glenn Nye and Tom Perriello and Rick Boucher were defeated in 2010 the Republicans were taking no chances and redrew the CDs to make them more Republican friendly. Obama actually won one CD represented by a Republican.The proposal came from a state senator whose intention seems racist - he wants rural (for which you can read \"white\") voters not to be outvoted by urban (for which you can read \"black\" and to a lesser degree \"Hispanic\") voters.It will not go anywhere.It is ironic that the vote distribution turned out to so closely match the ratio of the 3/5 Compromise.But then part of the pushback against Obama has from the beginning been because he was Black.Odd that the ratio would now increasingly include young people and women as well as people of color.Again it won\\'t happen in Virginia.It seems like the parallel in Florida is also dead because the Republican heads of the two chambers of the state legislature are opposed to splitting the electoral vote.But let\\'s be clear - the intent of such proposal is not merely to steal states for Republicans that they might not otherwise win it is to diminish the value of the votes of minorities and expand the power of angry old white men.Like the attempts this past cycle at voter suppression through voter-id laws and limiting access to early voting this will produce a backlash.Perhaps those pushing such proposals really do want to make Obama voters count for only 3/5.In the process what they might be demonstrating is that they themselves have only 3/5 the intelligence and moral character of those whose votes they seek to diminish.',\n",
       " 'First says Attorney General Greg Abbott the redistricting is not about race. Oh no. It\\'s about not allowing DEMOCRATS to vote. White Democrats too.From their brief:DOJ’s accusations of racial discrimination are baseless. In 2011 both houses of the Texas Legislature were controlled by large Republican majorities and their redistricting decisions were designed to increase the Republican Party’s electoral prospects at the expense of the Democrats....The redistricting decisions of which DOJ complains were motivated by partisan rather than racial considerations and the plaintiffs and DOJ have zero evidence to prove the contrary. It is perfectly constitutional for a Republican-controlled legislature to make partisan districting decisions even if there are incidental effects on minority voters who support Democratic candidates.Translation:\"So basically we just want to fuck over all Democrats and if the Black and Brown people are also hurt well they shouldn\\'t vote for Democrats should they? It\\'s only collateral damage\"You know having them actually come right out and say it--that they don\\'t want Democrats to vote--is somehow not surprising. But it\\'s good that they\\'re doing it at last.But wait! There\\'s more. To address the actual accusations of racial bias and discrimination Texas is using the argument that \"Yeah there may be an isolated incident or two but it\\'s NOTHING like it was in 1965\".From the article which says it better than I can:Furthermore the state claims even if Texas did discriminate and the state stresses that it did not it was nothing as bad as “the ‘pervasive’ ‘flagrant’ ‘widespread’ and ‘rampant’ discrimination that originally justified preclearance in 1965.” So as long as Texas skies aren’t alight with flames from burning crosses what’s the big whoop?So according to this Texas is arguing that Section 2 and in fact the entire reasons for preclearance are all based on conditions in 1965. And that since \"things are better than in 1965\" then Section 2 is null and void.I think the fact that Texas is second only to Mississippi in Section 2 lawsuits is the basis for this particular argument.However there is a danger here. Texas is arguing that ONLY conditions that existed in 1965 would justify Federal supervision of the elections process. Sort of like an \"originalism to the extreme\" argument.And that can be dangerous because there are those on the Supreme Court that would like nothing more than the total eradication of the Voting Rights Act.Not to mention the 13th 14th and 15th Amendments but that\\'s another story.',\n",
       " 'So I am overjoyed about what happened in Texas not the least because it was so unexpected and so....freaking great. I loved every minute of it and can\\'t tell you how happy I am to have a new Democratic hero in Wendy Davis.I want to make this very clear so people will understand what is in my heart as I write this diary. I watched the breathless news tonight on MSNBC and I saw Kos\\'s effort to draft MS. Davis to run for governor and I\\'m all over it all.But there was a part of me that felt SO sad too. I remember when Wisconsin\\'s capitol was filled w/that kind of crowd for WEEKS ON END. I remember when Democrats and progressives in Wisconsin filled not only the rotunda of their capitol but all the real estate they could in every direction OUTSIDE the capitol for WEEKS ON END.And most here at the DK supported the effort and it was thrilling. Then came the recall and we lost. I could say why I think this happened but it doesn\\'t matter. It just did. And since then despite all those thrilling hopeful days things have only gotten worse in Wisconsin.And one of the biggest ways that has happened is the Wisconsin republican answer to seeing THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN as long as they\\'re in power. They have made endless laws to make sure of that. And now what happened in Texas last night will be very difficult for Wisconsin to match. It\\'s crazy. Possible in Texas almost impossible in Wisconsin.Those of us caught up on the new laws and restrictions regarding what is allowable in the state house and who can be there and under what conditions know how fast after the loss of the recall the GOP clamped down on seeing to it that nothing like the anti Walker uprising would happen again on their watch. I could go on for many paragraphs here telling you how specific and restrictive those new laws are. I could roll your socks back as to the totalitarian and successful cap the Wisconsin GOP has put on anything like what happened in Texas yesterday and what happened in Wisconsin week after week at one time not so long ago.Recently the Republican Wisconsin legislature voted to pass a law similar to what was at stake in Texas. The \"gallery\" was highly restricted. Women w/tape over their mouths---to signify protest to the new rules of their being there---were told to remove the tape or be arrested. They removed the tape and covered their mouths w/their hands. Some Democrats in the chamber tried to shout their way into their right to be heard.But in the end Mike Ellis broke his gavel telling everyone to shut the fuck up they would NOT be heard. This disgraceful behavior was shown here a bit on video and God bless her on Rachel Maddow\\'s show. Other than that crickets. The nation has left the story of Wisconsin behind. We tried we lost and journalism is not about losers.I CHEER what happened in Texas yesterday with all my heart. BUT beware of the media story on your side today. Because it can be gone tomorrow. And don\\'t underestimate the response of republicans when they have been so challenged. I\\'ll bet you the little money I have in the bank that Texas too will soon have a bunch of laws that make it impossible for what happened yesterday to happen again. The only reason they aren\\'t there now in Texas is because what happened surprised the hell out of them. Don\\'t doubt for a minute that they\\'re gathered in back rooms as I write this figuring out to make sure it never happens to them again.I cheer every minute of attention Texas gets w/this and I cheer Wendy Davis. I don\\'t want it to go away. But I know it will. My message here is not about cynicism or about \"don\\'t bother.\" IT. IS. NOT.My message is that we are on the brink of so much in this country and we have to find a way to stop letting them get away with this. And that means in Wisconsin too no matter how gerrymandered it is. I frankly don\\'t know how to do this. But I do know the answer is NOT to bow out from the fight in a heap of disappointment and anger. And I don\\'t for a minute suggest that\\'s what Wisconsin Democrats are doing. BUT everything is so much harder for them now.Wisconsin must find a way to rise again and Texas must find a way to hold on to this win. And part of that is seeing what\\'s coming. And I\\'m telling you what\\'s coming in Texas. Somehow some way we must stop this. And that means we have to decide our priorities as Democrats. And there in lies the rub. And I have no answer for it.',\n",
       " 'During the 11 years she spent as labor minister in her state Ms. Dreyer — a trained lawyer who served as a state prosecutor in Bad Kreuznach before entering politics as the mayor of that same city — became known for tackling problems at the source. She held roundtable meetings to discuss the issue of caring for the elderly in nursing homes so that workers could participate. Her own experiences as the mother of a patchwork family with three children and resident of a publicly sponsored social living project have contributed to her image of being straightforward and someone to whom average people can relate.Bettina Munimus a researcher with the European Academy for Women in Politics and Economics based in Berlin said that Ms. Dreyer’s more consensus-oriented approach is indicative of an overall shift visible in the other states where women are now in charge — including the biggest North Rhine-Westphalia as well as Saarland and Thuringia.“In the previous generation the old male politicians used the ‘basta’ style of politics to outwardly demonstrate power and the need for the final word” Ms. Munimus said. Not so the female governors. “They know that power is needed to bring about policy but along the way it is important to cooperate to create policy with others. That is the identifying factor of this style.”Since 2010 another Social Democrat Hannelore Kraft has governed North Rhine-Westphalia Germany’s most populous state and one known for decades as much for its old boys’ political network as for its heavy industry.Ms. Kraft was forced to settle right after her election for a minority government that relied on the support of political foes to pass legislation. Together with the deputy governor Sylvia Löhrmann from the Greens Ms. Kraft dubbed her government the “invitation coalition” and got to work.Two years later her fragile constellation collapsed and Ms. Kraft faced off against a former minister from Ms. Merkel’s conservative party in fresh elections last May. Not only did Ms. Kraft retain her governorship; she won a clear majority in the state legislature for government with the Greens.Many Germans would have liked to see Ms. Kraft run as the Social Democratic candidate challenging Ms. Merkel for the chancellorship in September elections. A recent survey by Statista pollsters showed the 51-year-old the third most popular politician in the country after Ms. Merkel and Joachim Gauck the German president.',\n",

       " 'U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is alleged to be one of the great intellects of conservative jurisprudence but his comments during oral arguments over a challenge to the 1965 Voting Rights Act displayed all the mental acuity of a third-tier talk radio bozo.Shelby County Ala. is making the case against the voting law. Section 5 of the act empowers the federal government to negate new local and state voting rules if they would lead to discrimination against minority voters. It has been enforced primarily in Southern states that had a long dismal history of preventing African Americans from voting. Shelby County contends that the problem has been remedied and so Section 5 is no longer justified.Rep. John Lewis of Georgia begs to differ. Lewis was severely beaten in Selma during the 1965 “Bloody Sunday” police riot directed against peaceful civil rights marchers. The horror of that scene as it played out on America’s television screens led directly to congressional approval of the Voting Rights Act.In an interview with USA Today Lewis talked about the methods used to bar blacks from voting back in 1965 and insisted that more subtle impediments still are being employed to undercut voting rights today.Advertisement“You may not have what we had such as the literacy tests or asking people to count the number of bubbles in a bar of soap or the number of jelly beans in a jar” Lewis said. “It may not be the overt acts of violence that we had and witnessed during the ‘60s. But the result is the same.”As recently as 2006 both houses of Congress agreed with Lewis. After extensive testimony lawmakers determined that a long list of problems still exists and they renewed the Voting Rights Act for an additional 25 years. The vote was overwhelming in the House unanimous in the Senate and was hailed by President George W. Bush as a victory for American democracy.In court on Wednesday however Scalia mocked that vote. He said the Senate’s unanimity simply proved the law had not been given serious consideration. The senators were afraid he said to cast a vote against a law with a “wonderful” name. He went on to assert that the reauthorization of the act was merely “a phenomenon that is called perpetuation of racial entitlement.”That sort of legal reasoning may be good enough for someone sitting on a bar stool well into his third pint but it is not good enough for the highest court in the land. Scalia makes self-serving assumptions about what was on the minds of senators in 2006 -- afraid not serious enamored with a name -- with no facts to back up his barbs.AdvertisementTossing actual statistics back at Scalia Justice Elena Kagan cited a string of continued voting-rights violations. As to the state of mind of the senators she said the unanimous vote was pretty good proof that the evidence of contemporary abuses was convincing even to conservative Southerners.“It was clear to 98 senators including every senator from a covered state who decided that there was a continuing need for this piece of legislation” Kagan said.Undeterred Scalia opined that a law governing voting rights is “not the kind of question you can leave to Congress.” Oh really? The right to vote is the core of our constitutional democracy. It is not as Scalia says “a racial entitlement” it is an American entitlement. It seems that might be a very useful thing for Congress to watch over and protect. It was eminently important in 1965 and remains important today.One need only consider the outrageous voter suppression measures attempted in Ohio Pennsylvania Florida and other states in the 2012 election cycle to see that the right to vote is still something certain Americans must fight for. It is true that impediments put in the way of black and Latino voters now are not so much about racial animosity as they are about the fact that those racial groups overwhelmingly vote for Democrats but the effect as Lewis says is the same.AdvertisementGiven the weirdness of his comments it might not be wrong to assume Scalia’s true concern is less about “racial entitlement” than it is about making sure his fellow Republicans are entitled. Entitled that is to manipulate elections when they can no longer win fair and square.',\n",
       " 'Gary May is a history professor at the University of Delaware and the author of “Bending Toward Justice: The Voting Rights Act and the Transformation of American Democracy.”In the debate over the future of the Voting Rights Act  it sometimes becomes apparent that certain members of the Supreme Court are either oblivious to our nation’s recent history or willfully ignore it. Justice Antonin Scalia made this abundantly clear in his comments during the Feb. 27 oral argument in Shelby County v. Holder  statements that he repeated in a speech on April 15.To Scalia the Voting Rights Act — especially Section 5 which requires covered states to submit any changes in voting practices to the Justice Department or a Washington court for approval — is a “racial entitlement” and a violation of state sovereignty. In his view it unfairly and unnecessarily treats seven Southern states plus Alaska Arizona and parts of six others differently from states not covered by the act. This month according to the Wall Street Journal he called the act a form of “racial preferment” that affected only African Americans while ignoring the white population.Such statements indicate that Scalia is woefully ignorant of the legislation’s history. Because of our nation’s painful legacy of racial injustice the Voting Rights Act of 1965 has often been used to safeguard black voters specifically but its protections extend to all Americans regardless of skin color as was vividly demonstrated in the period after its passage.Enactment of the Voting Rights Act also led to the abolition of the poll tax. So in May 1966 African Americans were able to vote freely for the first time in an off-year primary election. Across the South many blacks sought a host of elected offices from county sheriff to seats in state legislatures. In Alabama a Democratic candidate for governor Attorney General Richmond Flowers vigorously campaigned for black votes. If elected he promised he would appoint blacks to positions in his administration — men and women active in the civil rights movement he pledged not “just a few Uncle Toms.”1 of 16 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws the Supreme Court View Photos A collection of cartoons about the high court.

June 27 2013 Tom Toles Wait 1 second to continue.The favorite to win in Alabama however was Flowers’s opponent Lurleen Wallace a stand-in for her husband George the gubernatorial incumbent who was ineligible to run because of term limits. A vote for the Wallace ticket would be a vote for segregation; George Wallace had been the scourge of the civil rights movement in Alabama and had actively incited racial hatred to obtain the support of white voters.On Election Day the turnout was extraordinary. In Selma the polls opened at 8 a.m. but black voters started lining up hours before. In Birmingham a blistering sun caused one older man to faint but when an ambulance arrived he refused to go to the hospital until he had cast his ballot. “This is the first time I’m voting” he said. “It might be my last.”Voting continued far into the night. In Montgomery the polls were supposed to close at 6 p.m. But at 8:30 1100 African Americans were still waiting at the polls and refused to leave before they had voted. At that same hour in Birmingham 700 voters had waited patiently for more than five hours. “It made me think I was sort of somebody” Willie Bolden the 81-year-old grandson of slaves told a reporter.For African Americans the outcome was disappointing. Few black candidates were elected and Mrs. Wallace won a resounding victory with 399024 votes nearly twice as many as her husband had won four years earlier. Few had doubted that Wallace would win but the size of her victory was what was truly surprising. And it was due in part to the Voting Rights Act.Analysts later discovered that while their projections had accounted for the historic enfranchisement of Alabama’s blacks they had missed an equally important development: the even greater expansion of the white vote. By eliminating the literacy tests and other impediments such as the poll tax the Voting Rights Act gave many poor whites the opportunity to register and cast ballots. A skillful get-out-the-vote campaign by Wallace’s staff added 110000 new voters to the white majority decreasing black influence even as the number of black voters grew. Nor was this phenomenon limited to Alabama. Throughout the South many of the new registrants were white.This election indicates that Scalia is wrong when he calls the Voting Rights Act “a racial preferment” that provides no protection for white voters. The act protects all voters especially in the states and districts covered by Section 5 from any obstacles that might be put in their way. That was true in 1966 and remains true today as efforts to suppress the minority vote continue. Scalia needs to do his homework before the court determines the act’s future.',\n",
       " 'The Justice Department on Monday sued North Carolina over the state’s restrictive new voting law which requires photo identification for in-person voting and cuts back on early voting and same-day registration — all of which will disproportionately affect black voters. The suit which follows similar litigation against Texas is the latest effort by the department to go after voting discrimination in the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling in June striking down part of the Voting Rights Act.Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. called the North Carolina law “an intentional attempt to break a system that was working” and he said that it was clearly intended to discriminate on the basis of race.But North Carolina and Texas represent only one front in the continuing battle to protect voting rights. Twenty years after Congress passed the “motor voter” law to make it easier for Americans to register to vote numerous states keep trying to make it harder relying on vague and dubious claims of voter fraud to push through misguided and harmful legislation.The 1993 law formally known as the National Voter Registration Act established a uniform federal form that requires only that voters attest under penalty of perjury that they are citizens.

       " 'WASHINGTON — After pushing through one of the most significant rule changes in Senate history Majority Leader Harry Reid struck a solemn tone: “This is not a time for celebration.”But behind closed doors in a room off the Senate floor some of the newer Democratic senators couldn’t help themselves gathering for a quick party to congratulate one another. They were the ones largely responsible for pushing the veteran Nevada lawmaker to pull the trigger on ending filibusters against most presidential nominations.The partisan revelers were part of a new breed of Democrats emerging in the Senate. Mostly elected after 2006 these relative newcomers have only known a Democratic-controlled Senate and have little experience with successful bipartisan cooperation due largely to the tea party’s grip on the Republican Party.Now they are hoping to become a new power center in the party nudging the old guard to adopt more aggressive tactics in pursuit of legislative goals and largely brushing aside Republican threats of retaliation and obstruction. They see the rules and traditions of the Senate as having stifled the will of the majority and stalled President Obama’s agenda.Advertisement“The Senate is a graveyard for good ideas” Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) who along with Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon led the filibuster reform effort and won over veteran colleagues in a body where seniority was once the most valuable currency.PHOTOS: 2013’s memorable political momentsThis newer class of Democrats came to Washington not unlike the tea party Republicans with a strong commitment to their ideals and policy goals. But while the tea party rule in the House has been characterized by attempts to stifle the president’s agenda Democrats see their goal as helping to implement it.Thursday’s action to limit the use of filibusters — seen as so drastic it was termed the “nuclear option” — shows they are willing to carve out a different path to get there.Advertisement“There’s a time to reach across the aisle and there’s a time to hold the line” said Sen. Christopher S. Murphy (D-Conn.) the body’s youngest member at 40 who was elected in 2012. “And I think so far this year Democrats in the Senate have done a very good job of mixing across-the-aisle compromise with some heretofore unseen spine-stiffening.”The time has come for Democrats to take a harder stance against the tea party Republicans he said.“These folks have come to Washington to destroy government from within and will use any tool at their disposal” Murphy said. “To the extent that we have the ability to take tools away from the tea party we should do it. And one of the tools was the filibuster. Another was the belief that Democrats would cave in the face of another shutdown or debt default.”For Murphy the failure of the Senate gun control bill earlier this year was the final straw. He took on the issue of gun violence after the Newtown school shooting in his state in 2012. A bipartisan bill crafted by Sens. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) had 55 votes but failed to advance.Advertisement“I was a proponent of filibuster reform coming into the Senate but I became a revolutionary on this issue when we lost the gun bill” Murphy said.The group also includes Elizabeth Warren elected last fall in Massachusetts. Her firebrand style and unabashed liberalism have energized the party’s left wing.The senators’ influence has already been seen in other fights most recently in the 16-day shutdown when new Democrats lobbied party leaders to stand up to Republicans — a tactic that seemed to shock many on the other side of the aisle who were betting that Democrats would blink first.Next on their agenda is extending the filibuster rule change from presidential appointments to legislation which would enable the Senate to move on issues including gun control and climate change.AdvertisementPHOTOS: The battle over ObamacareAt times their advocacy has presented challenges to the administration. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) elected in 2006 circulated a letter among his colleagues urging the president to appoint Janet Yellen — not Lawrence H. Summers — as Federal Reserve chair because Summers’ banking policies were viewed as having contributed to the financial meltdown. About a third of the party including Merkley and Warren signed it. Yellen is now on track to take the post after advancing this week from the Senate Banking Committee with Brown and Warren’s support.And Senate confirmation is virtually assured thanks to the new rule change against filibusters.“The Elizabeth Warren wing of the Democratic Party definitely are showing that they have growing influence in the caucus and in government in general” said Matt Wall of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee a group that works to promote progressive candidates and issues in Democratic primaries. On Friday Warren circulated a fundraising letter to supporters on behalf of Merkley and Udall thanking them for their role in changing the rule. Both men face reelection in 2014.AdvertisementThe changing Democratic tactics may reflect a generational shift occurring in the Senate. It’s almost certain that by the start of the next Congress in 2015 more than half of the Democratic caucus will have been elected since 2008 when gridlock reached new heights. But nine of the new Senate Democrats are former Congress members all of whom served at least part of their time under Republican majorities. Three were governors who served with Republican legislatures.The shift among Democrats has at times confounded Republicans particularly on the filibuster issue. Aides to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) the third-longest-serving Republican said they had felt that Reid’s most recent moves telegraphing the nuclear option were a bluff.Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Thursday railed against the actions of “uninitiated newcomers in the Democratic caucus” reminding them they had never served in the minority in the Senate. Those who have a longer memory “should know better” he added.Six-term Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan was the only Democrat to speak out against his party’s move citing the late institutionalist Sens. Edward M. Kennedy and Robert C. Byrd in arguing against tinkering with long-standing rules.Advertisement“Before we discard the uniqueness of this great institution let us use the current rules and precedents of the Senate to end the abuse of the filibuster” said Levin who will retire after next year.But those pushing for the rule change won over one Democratic stalwart.“There are many of us that really wanted to keep things the way they were because that’s the way they were” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). “One thing I know: that you learn from history. And right now we can’t let the present be the future. So you’ve got to make the change or this becomes a body that doesn’t mutate.”Reid’s thinking has also evolved. When Merkley as a prospective candidate first met with Reid ahead of the 2008 election he told the leader that filibuster reform was one of his top priorities. Reid put his head in his hands a Merkley aide recalled. “It’s not about the filibuster” Reid admonished the younger man. “It’s about the culture. We’ve got to change the culture.”AdvertisementSix years later the culture is the same and the filibuster is gone.michael.memoli@latimes.comTwitter: @mikememoli',\n",

There is a reason the GOP or CPAC or any of the other wingnut outfits can\\'t win over anyone other than screaming white guys who cheered George W Bush on and suddenly got pissed off when President Obama was first inaugurated. The incestuous amplification of white Republicans telling white Republicans that race no longer matters only works on white Republicans the root of the problem is that the entire GOP as a structure is rooted around demonizing everyone who isn\\'t white or privileged and that by nature excludes everyone else. I mean it\\'s hard to put \\'Mr. Obama is a Kenyan Trump\\' on stage and then wonder why you can\\'t win black people.I guess you don\\'t have to be a poor demented honky to vote Republican but it helps.The floor is now yours . . .Surprise the white guy screaming in this video is a Brietbart hack check out the diary posted by bluebarnstormer http://www.dailykos.com/...Another note Republicans have convinced themselves that there is no racism for the same reasons they claim there is no such thing as Global warming or that the problem is that we don\\'t have enough guns on the street Republicans pretend these problems don\\'t exist and take offense if you claim they do because Conservatives and their wealthy financial backers are the chief beneficiaries of racism and pollution and the flooding of America with high power war rifles. Saying racism doesn\\'t exist then allows you to turn a blind eye to it because of course it doesn\\'t exist so what\\'s the problem. That is why Republicans tell themselves that black people would only vote GOP if they really knew what the GOP was about. As if that isn\\'t insulting.If they admit the problem exists they have to offer a solution so they don\\'t. Instead they insist that the problem of racism pollution and other things don\\'t exist at all unlike socialism.And there you have it. Republicans can\\'t admit racism exists because they are the sole beneficiaries of it keeping poor white people voting for rich white people is only possible if the strawman of the Sherriff is black.And the media will never state that because they are owned by the corporations who stand to gain the most if Republican racism remains the Elephant in the Room pardon the pun.Magical thinking doesn\\'t fix these problems. And magical thinking is all the GOP has left that and fear./peace',\n",

       " 'Story highlights Not everyone is a fan though Mayor Bloomberg vows to help with the transition Biracial family of New York Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio influences his campaign Increasing visibility of de Blasio clan resonates with New Yorkers(CNN) —Throughout Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio’s campaign for New York’s top political act his backup band seemed to overshadow the headliner.His son Dante a sophomore at a public high school in Brooklyn appeared prominently in campaign ads his soaring Afro a topic of conversation in political circles. Daughter Chiara a college freshman out-danced the rest of the telegenic family at the West Indian Day Parade with a move they called “The Smackdown.”Watch the de Blasios dance “The Smackdown”A virtual unknown nationally despite 25 years in New York politics de Blasio defied critics who questioned whether his experience as a city councilman from Brooklyn and most recently as public advocate – a sort of civic watchdog – sufficiently prepared him to run the Big Apple. He also ran Hillary Clinton’s first U.S. Senate campaign.But his biracial family’s increasing visibility resonated with residents of a city coping with a 21% poverty rate and increasing racial divisiveness brought on by the controversial “stop-and-frisk” policy allowing police to search people in high-crime areas.“His family just because of the racial mix represents a big and increasingly large part of the city and speaks to certain sensibilities” said Harold Ickes a veteran Democratic Party operative who advised the campaign and has known de Blasio for two decades. “The family is very important to Bill… From the outside this family represents a part of the city not represented in city government.”The de Blasio clan was featured prominently in commercials and campaign events. Dante then 15 appeared in his own ad over the summer that highlighted his father’s stance against “stop-and-frisk.” Dante and his hair immediately became a social media sensation – and de Blasio began to surge in the polls.In addition Chirlane McCray a political activist who once identified herself as lesbian before marrying de Blasio emerged as a top campaign strategist.5 things to know about New York’s new mayorDeBlasio 52 portrayed himself as the “unapologetically progressive alternative to the Bloomberg era” saying that the current mayor’s polices favor the rich. He repeatedly used the Dickensian phrase “a tale of two cities” to describe New York City under billionaire Mayor Michael Bloomberg.The wealth inequality message appeared to have struck home with minority and low-income voters on Tuesday giving de Blasio an advantage over Republican candidate Joe Lhota among black and Latino voters compared to white voters.“The city is much more racially mixed than when Bloomberg took office” Ickes said. “A lot of people having a hard time economically are black Hispanic and Asian and Bill spoke elegantly to that.”De Blasio’s critics accused him of dividing the city along economic and racial lines and credited “stop-and-frisk” with a sharp crime reduction during Bloomberg’s tenure.Appearing on CNN’s The Lead with Jake Tapper on Wednesday Bloomberg said he had a meeting with de Blasio and vowed to help with the transition.“Keep in mind I have a big vested interest in making Bill de Blasio an even better mayor than I was” Bloomberg said. “We built a lot. We’ve given them a lot to work with… But the bottom line is I’m going to live in New York City and I want Bill de Blasio’s administration to be successful and our administration to do everything to transfer everything we’ve been doing over.”De Blasio who has a bachelor’s degree from New York University and a master’s in international and public affairs from Columbia University met McCray while working in the administration of David Dinkins the city’s first black mayor.When de Blasio delivered his acceptance speech late on Election Day he was surrounded like most of the campaign by his family.The strapping politician the first Democratic mayor in the largely-Democratic city in two decades hugged son and daughter and planted a firm kiss on the lips of his wife before going on to thank the many people behind his triumph.“The people I’m most grateful to and most grateful for are standing next to me” he said amid cheers and applause. “My partner in life my best friend in the world: she is brilliant and every bit as compassionate as she is tough the love of my life Chirlane McCray.”He added “Of everything I have to feel fortunate about I am most lucky most blessed to be the father of two extraordinary children: Chiara and Dante. They make me proud every single day. And my fellow New Yorkers they are very stylish.”De Blasio greeted his supporters in both Spanish and Italian. McCray introduced him: “From our family to your family I give you the next mayor of New York City.”',\n",
       " 'The Kansas secretary of state announced Wednesday that he and his Arizona counterpart are suing the federal government in an effort to ensure that anyone registering to vote shows proof of citizenship.A lawsuit filed by Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) and Arizona Secretary of State Ken Bennett (R) asks that the United States Election Assistance Commission include state-specific requirements for proof of citizenship on all federal voter registration forms in the two states the Kansas City Star reported.In June the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Arizona\\'s law allowing proof of citizenship requirements on state forms unconstitutional since federal forms did not require it. But the court also said that states with proof of citizenship requirements could ask the federal government to note those requirements on federal registration forms distributed in their states.The recent lawsuit comes days after the American Civil Liberties Union told Kobach that it intended to sue him over the state requirement citing 15000 voter registrations being held up due to lack of proof. But Kobach said his suit could preempt the ACLU suit since it addresses the ACLU\\'s concerns the Topeka Capitol-Journal reports.Doug Bonney the legal director for the ACLU of Kansas and Western Missouri told The Huffington Post that Kobach and Bennett\\'s lawsuit was expected. At the same time Bonney said he disagrees with Kobach\\'s analysis that this will end his group\\'s lawsuit to overturn the Kansas law.Bonney said that citizens are not able to register to vote because they cannot display proof of citizenship or because of bureaucratic issues. He said laws requiring people to attest to being citizens when registering to vote have worked well to prevent fraud.\"There is no proof of people fraudulently registering to vote\" Bonney said. \"For scores of years the attestation requirement has been perfectly find. This law makes it difficult for those who are citizens to vote because they cannot get properly registered.\"Kobach a tea party favorite who has written controversial immigration laws in Arizona and Alabama said that the citizenship proof is needed. \"Every time an alien votes it effectively cancels out the vote of a U.S. citizen\" Kobach said at the press conference on Wednesday.Opponents of the citizenship requirement told The Huffington Post that the suit is \"fear mongering\" and unnecessary. Former Kansas state Rep. Ann Mah (D-Topeka) Kobach\\'s most vocal critic said that she is not surprised by the suit. At the same time she stressed that every voter fraud investigation in Kansas has turned up minimal cases in the last decade. She said the real problem is the 15000 voter registrations being held up.\"There is no evidence out there at all\" Mah told HuffPost. \"Why do we have 15000 Americans who can\\'t vote because of the hoops they have to jump through?\"She said that since most voters register at state motor vehicle offices which are not equipped to process birth certificates to meet the state law voters would need to also visit an election office to complete the process.Arizona state House Minority Leader Chad Campbell (D-Phoenix) told HuffPost that he believes this is a way for Bennett to draw tea party votes for his 2014 Republican gubernatorial primary. Campbell who is seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination agreed with Mah that there is no voter fraud in the state.\"We\\'ve gone down this road time and time again we hear about all this supposed fraud from the tea party all the time\" he said. \"Every analysis shows there is no voter fraud taking place. It is political grandstanding and fear mongering from the tea party movement.\"',\n",
       " 'Let\\'s not let revisionism discolor what this was really all about. In it\\'s letter of Secession which was sent immediately after the Election of President Abraham Lincoln even before he took Office Texas stated the following:We hold as undeniable truths that the governments of the various States and of the confederacy itself were established exclusively by the white race for themselves and their posterity; that the African race had no agency in their establishment; that they were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race and in that condition only could their existence in this country be rendered beneficial or tolerable. That in this free government all white men are and of right ought to be entitled to equal civil and political rights [emphasis in the original]; that the servitude of the African race as existing in these States is mutually beneficial to both bond and free and is abundantly authorized and justified by the experience of mankind and the revealed will of the Almighty Creator as recognized by all Christian nations; while the destruction of the existing relations between the two races as advocated by our sectional enemies would bring inevitable calamities upon both and desolation upon the fifteen slave-holding statesIt was merely theof a President from a Party that endorsed Abolition even if that President at the time DID NOT make accomplishing that party of his platform or an agenda item of his administration - that drove the South in ato begin to dismantle the nation State by State.And now today we see more and more Tea Partiers - while also overreacting to an election they lost - slowly endorsing the legitimacy of a new secession and further - of ABSOLUTE rights of the BUSINESS OWNER over their EMPLOYEES (as well as CLIENTS) in everything from denying them a living wage and working conditions to Dictating Whether they can have access to Preventive Services in their HealthCare impose llfetime caps and openly discriminate against those who had the temerity to previously GET SICK.Apparently Modern Confederate Tea Partiers think the cruelty of that system is just \"Fine\".Wither is Freedom then eh?In the last few years there have been a rising of Pro-Confederacy Groups who\\'ve written such amazing revisionist history such as this.Southerners have less reason to be loyal to the collective enterprise that is the United States than does any group of citizens. The South was Invaded laid waste and conquered when it tried to uphold the original and correct meaning of the Declaration of Independance and the Constitution.Yeah right the South was \"\" - so much for those pesky letters of Secesion and that little Ft Sumter thing. Sure.And this happened merely because they felt they had the economic Right to continue practices such as this.Slavery was Evil. It was pure Economic Evil. Human Cruelty for Wealth and Profit. The Confederates were trying to Protect and Continue that system of Cruelty of The THEFT of Freedom Free Will and Choice for their own enrichment.But this is what they are what they\\'ve always been. They know it in their hearts and this is why they truly FEAR - deeply in their bones - an African American President such as Barack Obama. It is beyond their comprehension that he isn\\'t racked with a deep desire for Vengence against Whites.How could it not be?It was this type of deep atavistic fear that even affected Barack Obama\\'s own grandmother Toot. In his bookhe recounts how his grandmother while working in Texas following WWII had befriended a black janitor Mr. Reed who worked in the same building. They had a cordial friendship yet another - white - secretary working in the building proceeded to angrily scold them both for their familiarity telling Toot she should never ever \"call no\\'Mister\\'\".Years later in Hawaii when Barack was a boy living with his grandparents to attend High School in the U.S. while his mother worked overseas his grandmother encountered a particularly aggressive beggar who frightened her. A black beggar. Despite knowing the character of Barack\\'s father and of Barack himself - she was still terrified of him because she knew and had seen in Texas the kind of cruel mis-treatment people like him had received. She had a understanding of the righteous anger that that person could potentially feel and she feared it.That beggar was not Mr. Reed. But another 20 years later it very well could have been - and he would have be duly justified in his outrage. Gramps - Toot\\'s husband - angrily scolded her for her reaction to the beggar his feeling had always been the individuals are individuals not some collective mass of angst not some open racial sore that refuses to be healed. For all of this Barack had a ring-side seat. He witnessed both Yin and Yang.Unlike Toot who was sympathetic to those who suffered from bigotry identified with their outrage - and recognized it\\'s legitimacy - what the Modern Tea Party-Confederate feels is something worse.Guilt!No not their own personal guilt but the collective guilt of centuries of cruelty. They constantly try to wipe it away ignore it deflect it disguise it but it continues to come right back because they in their own heart of hearts simply don\\'t believe that any Nigger should ever EVER be called \"Mr. President\".It\\'s fear driven by that guilt that also drove the Confederates as it drives the Tea Party and now- the Republican Party.So of course they have to Do Anything Necessary to prevent this cruel retribution from being inflicted on the Good White people... um I mean the American People. They have to SHUTDOWN THE GOVERNMENT because that is the limited leverage they have with a majority in the House.They have to rail that Obamacare is a Complete and Total Failure even as Hundreds of Thousands successfully send in their applications despite initial website glitches and are finding they can get better care for far less than they were previously spending.They have to DENY Reality again and again and again.Obama was never a Slave. None of his Ancestors on his father\\'s side were Slaves. Most of what he knows about what it means to be historically \"Black In America\" came from his White Grandparents and their experiences during the 40\\'s and the 50\\'s as recounted to him. He has studied Langston Hughes and Baldwin and W.E.B. Debois to better understand the \"Black Experience\". He lived it within his own skin in LA whlie attending Occidental College in New York while working for a Non-Profit in Chicago working with communities to help incrimentally improve their lives. He\\'s seen it from just about every possible angle and he\\'s not racked with AngerHe\\'s not driven to seek Devine Retribution against the Ills of the White Race.ObamaCare is not Punishment for the Wickedness of Long Dead White People. Some of those White people going all the way back to the Revolutionary War are his own Ancestors.Obama is not a Kenyan. Not a Socialist. Not a Muslim. Not a Mau Mau Anti-Colonialist. Not a Fist Pumping Black Power Enthusiast. He\\'s not Mr. Reed nor is he the Beggar.He\\'s our American President. He\\'s doing the best he can under his power to improve the lives of All American Citizens. As did President Lincoln before him.Some day the Tea Party-Confederates will learn that lesson.

       " '8 years agoWashington (CNN) - Saying \"we will respond to the threat of climate change\" President Barack Obama used his second inaugural address to put the divisive issue back on the front burner. But according to a new national survey Americans are divided over whether global warming is a man made phenomenon.The president also used his speech to highlight the controversial issue of illegal immigration and a CNN/ORC International survey released Tuesday also indicates that a bare majority of the public says the main focus of the federal government should be on developing a plan that would allow undocumented immigrants to become legal residents rather than deporting them.[twitter-follow screen_name=\\'politicalticker\\']The president warned in his Monday address that failure to respond to climate change \"would betray our children and future generations. Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires and crippling drought and more powerful storms.\"According to the poll which was conducted last week 49% agree with the White House that global warming is a proven fact and is due to emissions from cars power plants and factories. That\\'s twice as high as the number who say that global warming has not been proven as well as the 24% who say that it is a proven fact but is not due to manmade sources. But the 49% figure is down seven points from 2007.There\\'s an expected partisan divide on the question with two-thirds of Democrats saying global warming is man made. That number drops to 48% among independent voters and is at 28% among Republicans.The president tried and failed in his first term to get a climate change bill through Congress. The president also came up empty during his first four years in the White House in trying to pass comprehensive illegal immigration reform though Congress.But Obama has put the issue on his to-do list this year and in his inaugural address he said \"our journey is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving hopeful immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunity; until bright young students and engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather than expelled from our country.\"By a 53%-43% margin people questioned in the poll say that main focus of the federal government should be on developing a plan that would allow undocumented immigrants to become legal residents rather than deporting them.That\\'s a switch from 2011 when by a 55%-42% margin Americans said that deporting undocumented residents and stopping more of them from coming into the country should be the main focus of U.S policy on illegal immigration.As expected the poll indicates a partisan divide on the issue as well as a generational divide with younger people saying allowing undocumented immigrants to become legal should be the top priority and a slight plurality of those 50 and older saying the emphasis should be on deportation and border security.One of the president\\'s biggest domestic accomplishments in his first term was passing a sweeping health care bill through Congress in 2010. In his inauguration address Obama acknowledged that there is still much work ahead on this issue saying \"we must make the hard choices to reduce the cost of health care.\"According to the poll 51% favor all or most of the provisions in the Affordable Care Act the official name of what many people refer to as \"Obamacare\" with 44% opposed to all or most of the provisions in the law.\"That\\'s a switch from 2011 when a CNN poll indicated that a majority opposed all or most of the provisions in the health care bill\" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.Minutes after his inauguration speech the president signed documents making official his nominations for some top Cabinet posts including former Sen. Chuck Hagel as defense secretary. The Nebraska Republican\\'s nomination has been met with reservations and even outright opposition by some senators of both parties who point to past positions he has taken on Israel Iran and the war in Iraq.According to the poll 48% think the Senate should confirm Hagel.\"That\\'s twice as high as the number who oppose his confirmation but with three in ten uncertain of how they feel about the issue the White House might breathe a little easier if support for Hagel were just over 50% rather than just under that mark\" adds Holland.The poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International on Jan. 14-15 with 814 adults nationwide questioned by telephone.

[…] But now the secret is out. On May 29 the Romney Readiness Project the Republican candidate’s transition organization known as R2P published a 138-page report detailing how it prepared for a potential Romney victory.“The White House staff is similar to a holding company” read one PowerPoint slide which would have been presented to President-elect Romney as part of an expansive briefing on the morning after Election Day. It went on to list three main divisions of the metaphorical firm: “Care & Feeding Offices” like speechwriting “Policy Offices” like the National Security Council and “Packaging & Selling Offices” like the office of the press secretary.Among the recommendations for the Romney administration: • Corporate-style training seminars were planned for appointees and nominees before the inauguration to teach management skills.• A plan to restructure White House operations to suit Romney’s corporate management style with clear deliverables.• Detailed flow charts delineating how information and decisions were disseminated through the administration to achieve “unity.”Oh God no. No no no. The actual document is horrifying. It\\'s horrifying in exactly the way you\\'d expect it to be horrifying coming from Mitt Freaking Romney\\'s camp.

It was a cunning plan to murder comedy outright.Once you get past the inherent terror of someone trying to think of the White House as a \"holding company\" and whatnot most of the supposed details of the plan seem simplistic at best for something allegedly the product of a 500 person team—for example a long series of slides explaining how the White House is organized written with words like \"COO\" and \"Selling\" in an apparent attempt to explain these things to whatever executive business critters were going to be brought on board to run those things. The policy prescriptions are broad and consist almost entirely of the same one-sentence vows Romney was making in various campaign forums. (Given that more than a few tax dollars helped pay for them to come up with this stuff charging the general public $24.95 to see the depressing end results seems a bit insulting.)The White House as holding company though–gonna be seeing that one in my nightmares.

I’m telling you anything that is against nature is not right.You know to be quite honest I know this is not politically correct. I never bought in that you are born that you are born gay. I can’t imagine it.When I say that it’s … behavioral preference they say that \"No you’re born with it.\" But I never bought into that.I think it’s just disgusting just to even think about.In strategizing on how to oppose the anti-discrimination ordinance Chan decided to have her staff draft an op-ed to appear in a local paper. “Can you guys come up with a draft?” she asks her aides. “Come up with draft with all the good those arguments we talk as a speaking point in terms of we’re addressing an issue that is not an issue. This is national politics again at the council level. “This is another layer of bureaucracy that we have not heard any discrimination” she continues. “And then add in the family value in there. … Maybe I’ll use the industries that we have a trend that is maybe I’ll use we have water rates and CPS rates to worry about.” “Maybe what we can do can we maybe throw some questionable confusions like OK this ‘transgender’ because the definition is so broad…”Perhaps even more interesting is how far she\\'s willing to go to cover up her obviously antiquated views from the public.Listen to the horrifying recording yourself:Chan\\'s then-chief of policy Jeff Bazan is the one on the recording who warns that we\\'re on a slippery slope toward incest and bestiality (how original right?) and tells Chan to be a \"culture warrior\" on the issue. Well he\\'s now working for pro-gay Democrat Ron Nirenberg who was just elected to the City Council as his chief of staff. Can somebody say awkward? Bazan released the following statement yesterday:I was basically explaining the viewpoint that some people have on the gay marriage issue. What I said was wrong and I deeply regret it. I can say that those comments which were intended to be purely political do not reflect my heart. Councilman Nirenberg whom I currently serve and support has made it clear that discrimination is not negotiable and I am proud to work for him.Right.As for Chan she acted as if she didn\\'t know Stevens at first when confronted about the recording. Then she had this to say:I think that\\'s in a private setting and I don\\'t know if that\\'s — I need to hear that recording to know. I\\'m not quite sure what you\\'re talking about so maybe you can play that back to me. We talk a lot of things in the staff meetings so I wanted to know also under what context.There is apparently a rumor that Chan is planning a run for Mayor in 2015 which she wouldn\\'t confirm or deny.

Since it has one thing should be clear. Liz has always believed in the traditional definition of marriage. She has also treated her sister and her sister's family with love and respect exactly as she should have done. Compassion is called for even when there is disagreement about such a fundamental matter and Liz's many kindnesses shouldn't be used to distort her position.Looks like there's trouble in the Cheney clan. Liz Cheney is running for something and in the Republican party running for something means you're against gay marriage even though her own sister is gay. Her father Dick is not running for anything anymore which means he has been freed to have a non-scummy opinion on the subject—and really when noted torture-of-prisoners advocate Dick Cheney is not a gigantic asshole about something it stands out. So now we get to watch the spectacle of Dick and Lynne Cheney releasing a public statement distancing themselves from their campaigning daughter. I like how they preemptively defend Liz from the notion that she's just pretending to be an intolerant ass on the subject.

       " 'In my Sunday column I explored the possible consequence of the Supreme Court’s impending rulings on gay marriage: a patchwork of different laws in different states making life very complicated for gay couples who want to move from one part of the country to another.But the general trend of public opinion toward greater acceptance of same-sex couples is clear. And there’s one subset of the population that’s especially intriguing: people who say homosexuality violates their religious beliefs yet are nevertheless inclined to allow gay unions as a matter of civil law. Call them “libertarian traditionalists”: culturally conservative in their own lives but upholding equal rights for those who don’t share their values.How big is this group? Perhaps surprisingly more than 1 in 4 Americans hold those seemingly conflicted opinions – at least when it comes to the general principle of equal rights for gay couples.AdvertisementTIMELINE: Gay marriage chronologyIn an invaluable series of recent polls the Pew Research Center has not only tracked the sea change in public opinion on homosexuality but has broken it down into constituent parts.AdvertisementPew polls in 2012 and 2013 found that 48% of Americans now favor allowing allowing gays and Lesbians to marry legally compared to 43% who are opposed. (Surveys performed more recently find even higher numbers in favor. An ABC News-Washington Post poll last month for example found 58% supporting gay marriage.)The value in the large-sample Pew surveys is the level of detail they offer. Pew found that majorities of both Democrats (61%) and independents (53%) favor gay marriage; self-identified Republicans (25%) are distinct outliers by comparison.AdvertisementPew found that “cross-pressured” opinion – people who oppose gay marriage in principle but support equal rights for homosexuals in practice – is more than a blip. Most respondents in the Pew polls (56%) say same-sex marriage conflicts with their religious beliefs; but half of the people in that group (28% of the public overall) also believe that same-sex couples “should have the same legal rights as heterosexual couples.”That means more than 1 in 4 Americans are holding two seemingly contradictory ideas: that gay marriage conflicts with their religious beliefs but same-sex couples should have the same rights as others. That pattern holds true for 29% of Republicans and 29% of evangelical Christians too.AdvertisementBut maybe that view isn’t as contradictory as it seems. In my column I quoted Timothy Keller pastor of an evangelical church in Manhattan saying “You can believe that homosexuality is a sin and still believe that same-sex marriage can be legal.” Keller doesn’t favor gay marriage; he was merely describing what he called an increasingly common view among young Protestant conservatives.Richard Land president of the Southern Baptist Convention’s commission on ethics and religious liberty outlined the same phenomenon in a recent interview with Politico. “Basically they just don’t think it’s something we want to talk about” he said of younger evangelicals. “[They say] ‘It feels intolerant. We believe what we believe; they have a right to what they want to believe. Marriage should be a church thing not a legal thing.’”AdvertisementALSO:McManus: SCOTUS-induced chaos on gay marriage?AdvertisementPhoto gallery: Battle of the signs at the Supreme CourtGay Marriage: What’s most offensive about the Defense of Marriage Act',\n",
       " 'Now that the U.S. Supreme Court has heard the arguments on both sides of California’s Proposition 8 and the federal Defense of Marriage Act the smart bet seems to be that though both restrictions on same-sex marriage are very likely to be struck down the court is not going to make a sweeping ruling that will allow homosexuals to marry in all 50 states.That means the political fight will go on and on. Yes the new conventional wisdom is that gay-rights advocates are certain to win the war but without a clear declaration from the high court that marriage equality is a constitutional right there are many battles yet to be fought. And the easy ones are largely over. Getting approval of same-sex marriage in places such as Washington or California or the liberal Northeast is a cinch compared to what it will take to change hearts and minds and laws in states such as Alabama and Oklahoma and Utah.A very hard task remains and the irony is that for heterosexuals getting married is ridiculously easy. Any pair of drunk heterosexual fools in Las Vegas can fall in love over the craps table run off to find an all-night chapel and wake to find themselves with hangovers cheap wedding rings and membership in the sacred club of husbands and wives.In 2004 Britney Spears showed up at the Little White Wedding Chapel in Vegas and married her childhood friend Jason Allen Alexander only to have their union annulled 55 hours later. Britney is hardly the only celebrity to have perfected the art of marriage as a short-lived publicity stunt (take a bow Kim Kardashian!). Then there was blond bimbo Anna Nicole Smith who married an 89-year-old billionaire without having to prove it was for love not for the inheritance.AdvertisementMany fabled movie stars – Elizabeth Taylor and Zsa Zsa Gabor come immediately to mind – adored being married and had the multiple spouses to prove it. Marital antics are not just a Hollywood thing though. No matter who they are or where they live or how many times they may have proved inept at matrimony or just plain unwise in the choice of a mate anybody can get married and divorced and married over and over again – as long as he or she is not gay.Meth addicts and gang-bangers can legally tie the knot and often do – sometime after the births of their children and before their own premature death. Even inmates in prison are sometimes allowed to marry. But two men who have built a home and spent devoted monogamous decades together still cannot get married in most states.That is not to say that gay people will prove to be any more successful and smart at marriage than straight Americans. I already am acquainted with two lesbian couples who married as soon as they could do it legally and divorced within a couple of years. Homosexuals are human. They will be just as foolish and unskilled at creating wedded bliss as the rest of us. But if a couple of gay guys or lesbian gals want to swill Gimlets and Cosmopolitans and then stagger to the altar at some neon-lit Las Vegas wedding chapel they should have as much right to their folly as any other Americans.',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON — The Obama administration has urged the Supreme Court to strike down California’s voter-passed law barring same-sex marriage arguing for the first time that the Constitution protects an equal right to marry for gays and lesbians.“Tradition no matter how long established cannot by itself justify a discriminatory law” the administration said in a brief filed with the high court late Thursday. “Prejudice may not be the basis for differential treatment under the law.”The administration’s legal argument also would apply in at least seven other states that already have granted same-sex couples nearly all the rights of marriage through civil unions. To give those rights while withholding the status of marriage would amount to discrimination based on a person’s sexual orientation and that cannot be justified under the Constitution the brief says.“The designation of marriage” the brief notes “conveys a message to society that domestic partnerships or civil unions cannot match.”Presenting the argument in that manner struck a legal middle ground — giving the justices a way to overturn California’s Proposition 8 without upsetting the laws in all states that ban same-sex marriage. Gay rights advocates have asked the court to strike down all laws nationwide that bar same-sex couples from marrying but many legal analysts have doubted that a majority of the justices would go that far.The seven other states directly affected would be Delaware Hawaii Illinois Nevada New Jersey Oregon and Rhode Island the brief says.In addition the government argued laws that discriminate based on sexual orientation should be treated skeptically by the courts much as laws that discriminate by gender. That standard if adopted ultimately could invalidate other states’ laws against same-sex marriage.The administration was not required to get involved in the California case but the White House was heavily lobbied by gay rights groups that have orchestrated a series of briefs on their side by business leaders prominent Republicans and other groups. Although the government’s brief did not go as far as gay rights advocates would have liked it won immediate praise from those organizations.Unlike most other outside groups the views of the solicitor general’s office often have particular weight with the justices although the court could decide the case on several other grounds.The decision to file a brief which came after several weeks of hesitation and internal debate marks the latest step in President Obama’s self-described evolution on the issue of same-sex marriage. When he ran for president in 2008 he did not support marriage rights for gays and lesbians although he also opposed Proposition 8 which California voters approved that year.Last spring as he was running for reelection Obama said he supported gay marriage but believed the issue was a matter for the states to decide. At the time some close to him suggested he would not weigh in officially on a constitutional right to marry.But in January gay rights activists took heart when in his inaugural address Obama compared their struggle to the civil rights and women’s movements.“We the people declare today that the most evident of truths — that all of us are created equal — is the star that guides us still; just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall” Obama said in that address putting on the same plane key moments in fighting discrimination based on gender race and sexual orientation.Since then Obama had appeared at times to be debating with himself. He referred to same-sex marriage as an issue of civil rights but also told people in his inner circle that he thought social change was better when it took place through elections not by court decree.In conversations he talked about the writings of civil rights leaders who had struggled with how and when to let courts drive societal change. On Wednesday Obama seemed to be resolving that inner battle as he paid tribute to civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks at a ceremony in her honor.“Whether out of inertia or selfishness whether out of fear or a simple lack of moral imagination we so often spend our lives as if in a fog accepting injustice rationalizing inequity tolerating the intolerable” he said.“Rosa Parks tell us there’s always something we can do” he went on. “She tells us that we all have responsibilities to ourselves and to one another.”In a statement Thursday Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. also put the marriage case in the context of the country’s civil rights tradition. “Throughout history we have seen the unjust consequences of decisions and policies rooted in discrimination” he said. “The issues before the Supreme Court are not just important to the tens of thousands of Americans who are being denied equal benefits and rights under our laws but to our nation as a whole.”Publicly White House officials took pains to present the decision of whether to weigh in on the marriage case as one made at the Justice Department.“The president obviously has expressed an opinion in the past on this issue as a matter of policy but when it comes to legal and constitutional issues around it that’s a jurisdiction that resides at the Department of Justice” White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said.Privately however senior administration officials made clear that on such a weighty policy issue the government’s lawyers would wait for the president’s decision.The case before the court will be the first to directly confront the justices with the question of whether the U.S. Constitution gives gays and lesbians a right to marry.Judges in several states have upheld gay marriage under their state constitutions and the California Supreme Court did the same in 2008. Proposition 8 overturned that ruling by changing the state constitution.The case before the high court began shortly afterward when two same-sex couples sued in federal court in San Francisco arguing that excluding them from marrying violated their rights to liberty and equal treatment.A federal judge agreed and struck down Proposition 8. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision but did so on the narrower basis that the voters could not take marriage rights from gays and lesbians once those rights had been granted.In December the Supreme Court voted to hear an appeal from defenders of Proposition 8 who say the courts should defer to the wishes of the state’s voters.California’s top officials including Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris have joined the case on the side of the gay plaintiffs. In a brief filed this week Harris noted that more than 50000 children in California are being raised by same-sex couples.“California’s interests in protecting all of its children are best served by allowing these same-sex couples to enjoy the same benefits of marriage as opposite-sex couples” Harris said.The case will be argued before the court on March 26.david.savage@latimes.comchristi.parsons@latimes.com',\n",
       " \"Bigots.Bigots.Scanning national media over the last several days one sees words such as homophobia bigotry and xenophobia thrown like confetti by liberals at anyone who dare say that under the federal constitution states have the right to define marriage. These scare tactics are actually working—Cardinal Timothy Dolan the archbishop of New York felt compelled to appear on national TV and explain that Catholic religious belief that marriage is between a man and a woman forever to create life is not bigotry but a religious teaching. The left's response—not enough. Nothing is enough short of changing religious doctrine to fit the beliefs of the liberal masses.This is a common refrain in right-wing circles these days:This is driving the wingers to distraction. Theirs is an entire movement built on the politics of resentment from the racist Southern Strategy to anti-gay ballot initiatives. Now those roosters are coming home to roost and the damage inflicted is incalculable.We liberals always knew modern conservatism was (literally) built on racial resentment from the day the Republican Party accepted the Dixiecrats with open arms. But that brand is seeping into the broader mainstream. I keep going back to this GOP focus group in Ohio after the 2012 election where young working-class white voters expressed dissatisfaction with President Barack Obama and the Democrats but were just vicious in their assessment of the GOP:None of them expressed great enthusiasm for Obama. But their depiction of Republicans was even more lacerating than the women’s had been. “Racist” “out of touch” and “hateful” made the list — “and put ‘1950s’ on there too!” one called out.Remember those aren't liberals but the kind of white working-class swing-state voters Republicans need to attract to offset their growing disadvantages with non-Anglo voters. But few want to vote for a racist hateful out-of-touch party straight out of the 1950s.That's why you'll now see the bigots spend half their time arguing that they're not bigots and don't really hate gay people it's just that they can't tolerate something consenting adults are doing so fuck them and their rights. See? It's not bigotry. It's just intolerance which is totally different than bigotry!The mask is off the modern GOP and all the whining and revisionism can't change the fact that America sees them for the hateful paranoid bigoted xenophobes that they are. And if that hurts their chances at winning elections? It just means that sometimes there really is justice in this world.\",\n",

Her announcement comes as the Supreme Court is about to hear two landmark gay rights cases that advocates hope will make same-sex marriage legal in all 50 states.Mrs. Clinton’s announcement represents a switch in position; as a presidential candidate in 2008 she explicitly opposed same-sex marriage saying that she favored civil unions but that decisions about the legality of marriage should be left to the states. (Until last year President Obama took that position as well; the president now favors a right to marriage for gay couples.) But Mrs. Clinton did take steps to protect gay couples when she was secretary of state work that she said “inspired me to think anew” about the values she holds.“L.G.B.T. Americans are our colleagues our teachers our soldiers our friends our loved ones and they are full and equal citizens and deserve the rights of citizenship’’ she said in the six-minute video using the abbreviation for lesbian gay bisexual and transgender. “That includes marriage.’’Mrs. Clinton spoke in the video of the recent wedding of her own daughter Chelsea saying “I wish every parent that same joy.’’Mrs. Clinton and her family have longstanding ties to the Human Rights Campaign.

       " 'For conservatives the concept of family is (1) the same as the Judeo-Christian model God ordained (2) a model supported by every other major world religion. It is the same unit (3) recognized by the laws of nature the (4) laws of government and (5) civilized societies for thousands of years: (6) one man married to one woman with so many children as God should see fit to entrust to their care through birth or adoption.If that happens the high priests and priestesses of political correctness will have done irreparable harm to yet another pillar of the American paradigm for our patriotic wholesome culture — “God the flag mom and apple pie.”The Obama administration makes the incredible assertion that motherhood is superfluous to rebut an argument that the traditional two-parent family led by both a mother and a father provides the ideal situation to raise a child. In defiance of biology nature and common sense the administration argues that children need neither a father nor a mother and that having two fathers or two mothers or more is just as good as having one of each.Government both federal and state has a legitimate and defensible interest in ensuring that children conceived by a mother and father are in fact raised by their biological mothers and fathers whenever possible.(1) Says you. (2) Except the \"multiple wives\" ones. (3) There is no \"marriage\" at all in the \"laws of nature\" and you have no earthly clue what the \"laws of nature\" even might be and \"family\" in nature is the result of anything from pair bonding to harems to gang rape to ritual murder to situational hermaphroditism to the male of the species biting the female upon which his body is slowly dissolved and absorbed into the female until only only the testicles are left so shut up about what the supposed laws of nature say we should be doing to get ourselves in a family way and (4) see (2) and (5) see (2) and (4) and a whole mess of civilized societies who thought having a young boy on the side was the purest form of love there could be and (6) I\\'m just going to point out yet a-freaking-gain that the whole concept of \"marriage\" has been for nearly all of human history a question of property rights and the spouse counted as a useful but not necessarily decisive portion of the property. I now have an absolute hatred for the sack that is Tim Huelskamp because he managed to hork up nearly every self-centered pompous-assed non-argument used by outright morons in the span of one quick paragraph and there really ought to be a rule saying if you do that the general citizenrygets to put you in the official congressional Dunk Tank and start flinging balls until somebody gets lucky.God damn it here we have a person honestly using \"God the flag mom and apple pie\" as the pillars of \"the American paradigm\" and they\\'re not doing it ironically neither the \"apple pie\" or the \"paradigm\" part. No Tim here means it literally and goes on to say that Bloomberg\\'s soda ban and Michelle Obama\\'s gentle-but-possibly-Hitlerish suggestions that our nation\\'s kids get up off their fat asses every once in a while means that apple pie is under attack. This screed isn\\'t an April Fool\\'s prank this is a April Fool\\'s way of life preached about by an April Fool\\'s mind taken as a holy god damn April Fool\\'s sacrament.You are an idiot and nobody\\'s arguing anything about that and by the way you are an idiot. Do you think—and we\\'re just going to explore this for one second before my migraine ends this entire path of debate—that if we do not allow same-sex marriage those children are suddenly going to get a mom and a dad? That there are gay couples out there who if we deny same-sex marriage will say \"Oh rats well I guess I am now going to form a lifelong partnership with the opposite gender which will suck for me but now my hypothetical future child will at least have appropriate biological nurturing.\" No. This does not happen. I hate you for thinking that this will somehow happen—that the only thing standing between every child and the one-man one-woman parenting that a great many of them do not currently have is to deny gay Americans certain legal and tax structurings.You Tim Huelskamp are a monster. Here you say that children should be raised by their biological mothers and fathers and yet you say yourself that you\\'ve adopted four of them. You are a terrible person. Those children will never know the love of a genetically related male/female pairing placed in that prime nurturing role and I can only assume it\\'s because you you bastard adopted them rather than letting them rot in an orphanage or on the streets where they could get a better appreciation of why it is they would want that thing.I don\\'t even want to go through all of Huelskamp\\'s drivel; it\\'s all just a collection of other people\\'s most vapid thoughts dumbed down beaten up then put in The Sack and tossed into op-ed form. It hurts. But the main argument such as it is is that if we let gay marriage take place then gay people are going to somehow god damn take our god damn children and raise them in god damn non-preferentially-biological households because god damn magic and it would be better to not allow marriage equality at all than allow that. He\\'s not even talking about \"gay Americans should not adopt children\" which would be at least something vaguely approaching the point he roughly purports to be orbiting around he\\'s saying that the Supreme Court recognizing same-sex relationships as existing things at all is an affront to \"motherhood\" and \"God\" and sweet Jeebus \"apple pie.\"This. This is why I have come to thoroughly despise this entire debate. Because it is not earnest it is not thoughtful it is not anything but the tin-eared rantings of bigoted dull-minded twerps who know they don\\'t like same sex marriages being recognized but can\\'t rustle up so much as even the slightest actual substantive non-God-says-so argument against the thing. God does not care what the tax status of same-sex couples is nor do I expect the big guy on the cloud has a pressing interest in making sure a pair of people can\\'t get hospital visitation or other legal rights if they don\\'t have the proper combination of non-matching genitalia. Even if we were to all stipulate that a one-mom-one-dad family is better for the children than a one-mom or one-dad single-parent version in all cases full stop which itself is an implausible argument you had at least better occupy yourself with explaining why you think a two-dad version has to be inferior to a single father or a two-mom version worse than the single mom version and not this damn generic high fructose corn syrup of arguments this blanket assertion that if we somehow discriminate more it will result in unspecified magic in which we don\\'t have single parents or foster homes or divorce or cheating spouses or broken homes or abusive parents or one bad traffic accident or teenage moms or Those Damn People Who Think Different From Me anymore.This is what happens when the last blowhards in an argument know they have lost. This is what happens when all sensible people have at long last moved on leaving only the dim bulbs and the lard-for-brains and the burlap sacks of discount-grade asbestos to prop up the dying cause. You get people like this guy droning on with mealy-mouthed phrases that mean nothing mustered for an argument that doesn\\'t even make any internal sense mustered because the only people left on the loser\\'s side of the debate are people who do not give a damn whether their arguments make any sense and all regurgitated up by whatever die-hard friendly rag has not yet evolved sufficient shame to know how silly it all looks.

John McCain the GOP\\'s presidential nominee in 2008 signaled his conditional support on Wednesday.\"It is time for Congress to pass a federal law that ensures all our citizens - regardless of where they live - can go to work unafraid to be who they are\" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid D-Nev. who urged House Speaker John Boehner R-Ohio to reconsider his opposition.The enthusiasm of the bill\\'s supporters was tempered by the reality that the Republican-led House where conservatives have a firm grip on the agenda is unlikely to even vote on the legislation. Boehner maintains his longstanding opposition to the measure arguing that it is unnecessary and certain to create costly frivolous lawsuits for businesses. Outside conservative groups have cast the bill as anti-family.In the Senate opponents of the legislation remained mute through three days of debate with no lawmaker speaking out. That changed on Thursday as Republican Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana said the legislation would force employers to violate their religious beliefs a direct counter to rights embodied in the Constitution.\"There\\'s two types of discrimination here we\\'re dealing with and one of those goes to the very fundamental right granted to every American through our Constitution a cherished value of freedom of expression and religion\" Coats said.The Senate rejected an amendment sponsored by Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania that would have expanded the number of groups that are covered under the religious exemption. Opponents argued that it would undermine the core bill.Story continuesSenate passage would be a major victory for gay rights advocates in a momentous year for the issue. The Supreme Court in June affirmed gay marriage and granted federal benefits to legally married same-sex couples. In the heartland Illinois is on the verge of becoming the 15th state to legalize gay marriage along with the District of Columbia.\"I hope that we are on the verge of making history tomorrow by passing this bill with a strong vote\" Sen. Susan Collins R-Maine said Wednesday. \"I then hope that our colleagues on the House side will follow suit and that we can see this bill signed into law.\"If the House fails to act on the bill gay rights advocates are likely to press President Barack Obama to act unilaterally and issue an executive order barring anti-gay workplace discrimination by federal contractors.Through three days of Senate debate backers of the bill repeatedly described it as an issue of fairness some 50 years after Congress passed and President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act.\"It is well past time that we as elected representatives ensure that our laws protect against discrimination in the workplace for all individuals that we ensure ... some protections for those within the LGBT community\" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski R-Alaska who described the diversity in her state.Murkowski\\'s support underscored the generational shift. Seventeen years ago when a bill dealing with discrimination based on sexual orientation failed by one vote in the Senate the senator\\'s father Frank voted against it. That was the same year that Congress passed and President Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act.Current federal law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex race and national origin. But it doesn\\'t stop an employer from firing or refusing to hire workers because they are gay lesbian bisexual or transgender.The bill would bar employers with 15 or more workers from using a person\\'s sexual orientation or gender identity as the basis for making employment decisions including hiring firing compensation or promotion. It would exempt religious institutions and the military.By voice vote Wednesday the Senate approved an amendment from Republican Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire that would prevent federal state and local governments from retaliating against religious groups that are exempt from the law.The Senate planned to vote Thursday on an amendment by Sen. Pat Toomey R-Pa. to expand the number of groups that are covered under the religious exemption.Likely Senate approval of the overall bill reflects the nation\\'s growing tolerance of gays and the GOP\\'s political calculation as it looks for supporters beyond its core base of older voters. A Pew Research survey in June found that more Americans said homosexuality should be accepted rather than discouraged by society by a margin of 60 percent to 31 percent. Opinions were more evenly divided 10 years ago.Deep-pocketed Republican-leaning groups such as the American Unity Fund which counts on hedge fund billionaires and Mitt Romney donors as well as former Republican lawmakers pushed for the legislation.Twenty-two states and the District of Columbia have approved laws banning workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and 17 of those also prohibit employers from discriminating based on gender identity.About 88 percent of Fortune 500 companies have adopted nondiscrimination policies that include sexual orientation according to the Human Rights Campaign. About 57 percent of those companies include gender identity.',\n",
       " 'One of the original stories is at here AlternetThe Presidential Inauguration Committee announced Tuesday that the President Obama has selected Pastor Louie Giglio of the Georgia-based Passion City Church to deliver the benediction for his second inauguration. In a mid-1990s sermon identified as Giglio’s available online on a Christian training Web site he preached rabidly anti-LGBT views. The 54-minute sermon entitled “In Search of a Standard – Christian Response to Homosexuality” advocates for dangerous “ex-gay” therapy for gay and lesbian people references a biblical passage often interpreted to require gay people be executed and impels Christians to “firmly respond to the aggressive agenda” and prevent the “homosexual lifestyle”I can tell you that one of the most hurtful parts of the first Obama administration was asking to have Rick Warren speak at his inaugural. He was giving a platform to someone who spread hate when there were so many other choices there. It was greatly resented by many in the LGBT community. In fact it set off a chain of events (Rev. Robinson \"accidentally\" not being shown on live TV etc.) which got Obama off on very bad footing with many in the LGBT community.Following McClurkin I was very angry with Obama. Then came Warren. But apparently Obama/the inaugural team haven\\'t learned anything:From above Alternet piece:(17:37) Men women I can’t say anything other to you tonight than this that if you look at the counsel of the word of God Old Testament New Testament you come quickly to the conclusion that homosexuality is not an alternate lifestyle… homosexuality is not just a sexual preference homosexuality is not gay but homosexuality is sin. It is sin in the eyes of God and it is sin according to the word of God. You come to only one conclusion: homosexuality is less than God’s best for his creation. It is less than God’s best for us and everything in our lives that is less than God’s best for us and his plan for us and his design for us is sin. That’s God’s voice. If you want to hear God’s voice that is his voice to this issue of homosexuality. It is not ambiguous and unclear. It is very clear.There are numerous other very incendiary quotes.So let me address the naysayers now:- But Obama has done so much for LGBT rights it\\'s just a speaker at the InaugurationUm first if you are trying to make improving LGBT rights a cornerstone of your presidency you don\\'t have to spit in the eye of the people you are supposedly trying to help. This is a PERSONAL choice. Hagel I can somewhat justify because there are other plusses to his candidacy. This is Obama picking yet another bigot when there could be much better choices out there who were/are not so vehemently anti-gayAlso when will he get past this bullshit of making in-roads with these people? These people will always vote against him and his agenda. Why give the marquee moment to a hater- But but he said those things long agoYeah and those are the seeds of hatred which were sown in the very people today who support discrimination against LGBT people.Also if Shirley Sherrod is up for scrutiny for what she didn\\'t even say Hagel for his homophobic remarks they why should this guy not be held accountable as would anything with a history of anti-African American anti-woman anti-Hispanic anti- remarks. Yeah the times are changing and its time for the haters and the Vichy apologists to be held accountable for hating when it was a much bigger trend.And for what it\\'s worth I am against Hagel ALSO for this reason. As Maddow pointed out there will be many many issues involving LGBT people in the military coming up. So he should answer for his bigotry then. Yet another reason why he is a bad choice.- But but Obama has a GAY CUBAN poet speakingAnd this argument pisses me off most of all. In Obama and Co\\'s mind if you put up a minority group that cancels out makes ok having the hater up there. No it doesn\\'t. You don\\'t have a \"mixed program\" by putting up people who have advanced society like Ms. Evers and those who have held it back. Once again we\\'ll likely have an inauguration with the usual symbolic winks and nods to the LGBT community while the hater gets a front row seat.Starting off Obama II in a sucky way like he started off Obama I. Except he can\\'t blame Boehner for this one. A fucking huge disappointment.',\n",

The federal government should not override the choices of any one community in an attempt to impose a national standard but should respect the rights of the people and the states” Johnson said in a statement.There are three other Republican senators hailing from states that Obama won twice who have not declared support for gay marriage. While they are also worth keeping an eye on there is less reason to believe they will support same-sex marriage in the near future.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is one but it’s hard to imagine him shifting on this issue since he’s viewed as a potential presidential contender and would have to appeal to conservatives if he runs.

       " '“We are the ones we’ve been waiting for. We are the change we seek” candidate Barack Obama said in 2008. At the time his comments came in for criticism: They were narcissistic; they were tautological; they didn’t make a whole lot of sense.But in the aftermath of Obama’s 2012 reelection and his second inaugural address his 2008 remarks seem less a statement of self-absorption than one of prophecy. There is an Obama majority in American politics symbolized by Monday’s throng on the Mall whose existence is both the consequence of profound changes to our nation’s composition and values and the cause of changes yet to come.That majority as the president made clear in his remarks would not exist but for Americans’ struggles to expand our foundational belief in the equality of all men. The drive to expand equality he said in his speech’s most historically resonant line “is the star that guides us still just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall.”Our history Obama argued is one of adapting our ideals to a changing world. His speech (like recent books by Michael Lind and my Post colleague E.J. Dionne Jr.) reclaimed U.S. history from the misrepresentations of both constitutional originalists and libertarian fantasists. “Fidelity to our founding principles requires new responses to new challenges” the president said. “Preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action. For the American people can no more meet the demands of today’s world by acting alone than American soldiers could have met the forces of fascism or communism with muskets and militias.”Having established that the moral and practical arc of U.S. history bends toward equality Obama vowed to push his demands for equality still further — to ending the systemic underpayment of female workers; the voter suppression that compels some Americans usually minorities to wait hours to cast their votes; the deportations of immigrants who would otherwise help build the economy; and the laws that forbid gay Americans to marry.1 of 68 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Obama View Photos A collection of cartoons of the president. Caption A collection of cartoons of the president. Wait 1 second to continue.As the president acknowledged however social equality is rising even as the relative economic equality that once defined American life has sharply and broadly receded. “Our country cannot succeed” he said “when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it.” For this Obama prescribed revamping our taxes and reforming our schools but these are by no means sufficient to transform our nation into one that as the president put it “rewards the effort and determination of every single American.” The waning of the middle class is with climate change the most vexing item on the president’s agenda and requires far-reaching solutions beyond any he laid out. U.S. workers must regain the power they once had to bargain for their wages but that only begins the list of economic reforms that are as difficult to achieve as they are necessary to re-create an financially vibrant nation.The president closed his speech by asking his supporters to join him to help “shape the debates of our time.” The biggest mistake Obama made when he took office was to effectively disband the organization of the millions of Americans who had worked for his election — for fear in part that it might upset members of Congress whose votes he would need for his policies. He wants no such unilateral political disarmament now; his operatives hope to keep his 2012 campaign’s volunteer army in the field for the legislative battles ahead. Obama’s legions have proven that they can win elections and this matters a great deal more the president has learned than whatever trace elements of goodwill he may win by deferring to Congress.The Obama Majority — its existence and mobilization — is what enabled the president to deliver so ideological an address. No such inaugural speech has been delivered since Ronald Reagan took office in 1981 demanding the curtailment of government programs and secure in the knowledge that much of the white working class had shifted its allegiance away from the Democrats and supported his attack on the public sector and minority rights. On Monday Obama secure in the knowledge that the nation’s minorities had joined with other liberal constituencies to form a new governing coalition voiced their demands to ensure equality and to preserve and expand the government’s efforts to meet the nation’s challenges. As he left the stage he stopped and turned to marvel at the crowd at the new American majority they represented. They were the ones he and we were waiting for.Read more from Harold Meyerson’s archive or follow him on Twitter.',\n",
       " 'PROVIDENCE R.I. (AP) — Hundreds of supporters of same-sex marriage rights assembled at the Rhode Island Statehouse on Tuesday urging lawmakers to make the nation\\'s smallest state the 10th to allow gay and lesbian couples to wed — and the last to do so in New England.House Speaker Gordon Fox who is gay has called for a vote on same-sex marriage legislation in his chamber by month\\'s end making Rhode Island the latest state to address an issue whose supporters see things swinging their way after voters in Maine Maryland and Washington approved gay marriage last fall.About 300 supporters and opponents signed up to address the legislative committee reviewing the bill — they were limited to 2 minutes each to keep the hearing from going all night — while hundreds more gathered in the hallways outside the hearing.Downstairs a raucous rally of gay-marriage opponents beneath the Statehouse rotunda at times drowned out those testifying in the third-floor committee room.\"I\\'d like us to get on the right side of history\" said Josephine O\\'Connell 71 of Providence who said it \"breaks her heart\" that her home state is the only one in New England that doesn\\'t allow gays and lesbians like her to marry. \"I don\\'t want to be looking back in 20 years thinking \\'what were we thinking?\\'\"Gov. Lincoln Chafee an independent and Treasurer Gina Raimondo a Democrat both spoke out in favor of gay marriage at the hearing.\"I\\'m here as your treasurer but I\\'m really here as a mother and wife\" said Raimondo. \"Every Rhode Islander deserves the same rights that we have.\"Hundreds of others showed up to urge lawmakers in this heavily Catholic state to drop the legislation and protect the current definition of marriage.The Roman Catholic Church opposes the legislation on religious grounds — and more practical ones. The Rev. Bernard Healey told lawmakers that the Providence Diocese is concerned Catholic schools and charitable organizations could be forced to change their employee benefit policies if compelled to recognize the same-sex spouses of employees.Story continues\"We are here to defend and support the longstanding definition of marriage... as the exclusive and lasting relationship of a man and a woman\" Healey said. \"Using the law to alter or redefine marriage is an injustice to those who have embraced this way of life.\"Others warned that allowing gay marriage would erode social norms.\"Just because these states in New England have decided to redefine marriage doesn\\'t mean we should follow them down this path\" said Michael Krzywonos of Pawtucket. \"The polygamists will be next in line. Then we\\'ll begin to test the boundaries of what age is permissible. And then we will test whether love and marriage can only be between two people.\"Supporters are hoping to build on national momentum following the votes in Maine Maryland and Washington. Meanwhile in Minnesota voters rejected a proposed state constitutional amendment that would have prohibited gay marriage the first time such a ballot question has failed in the United States.Lawmakers in Illinois are also expected to consider gay marriage this year.Supporters in Rhode Island expect the measure will pass the Democrat-controlled House but concede the state Senate is more challenging. Senate President Teresa Paiva Weed a Newport Democrat is a gay marriage opponent but has said she will allow a committee vote on the legislation should it pass the House. She said Tuesday that she would not vote for the legislation as it\\'s currently written.State lawmakers have passed civil unions for gay couples and Chafee signed an executive order recognizing gay marriages performed in other states.',\n",
       " 'As anyone who’s watched even a few minutes of A&E’s reality hit “Duck Dynasty” can tell you Phil Robertson is a pretty conservative guy.But in an interview published in January’s GQ Magazine the duck call inventor and Roberston family patriarch goes on record with comments about the sinfulness of gays and black people under Jim Crow that are about as forward-thinking as his Old Testament facial hair.In the profile an unedited Robertson sounds off on what’s ailing the country during a trip through the Louisiana backwoods.PHOTOS: Rednecks translate to greenbacks on TVAdvertisement“Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there. Bestiality sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men” he tells reporter Drew Magary. “Don’t be deceived. Neither the adulterers the idolaters the male prostitutes the homosexual offenders the greedy the drunkards the slanderers the swindlers—they won’t inherit the kingdom of God. Don’t deceive yourself. It’s not right.”He also muses rather colorfully about his own sexual orientation: “It seems like to me a vagina—as a man—would be more desirable than a man’s anus. That’s just me. I’m just thinking: There’s more there! She’s got more to offer. I mean come on dudes! You know what I’m saying? But hey sin: It’s not logical my man. It’s just not logical.”In a quote that may raise even more eyebrows than his feelings about gays Robertson claims he “never” saw black people mistreated during the pre-civil rights era in his home state and strongly suggests that African Americans were more content under Jim Crow.PHOTOS: Celebrities react to Prop 8 dismissal on TwitterAdvertisement“Where we lived was all farmers. The blacks worked for the farmers. I hoed cotton with them. I’m with the blacks because we’re white trash” he said. “They’re singing and happy. I never heard one of them one black person say ‘I tell you what: These doggone white people’—not a word!... Pre-entitlement pre-welfare you say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues.”Robertson also shares an interesting rationale for voting for Mitt Romney over President Obama saying he favored the candidate because he was from Salt Lake City a safer city than Chicago. “Where would I rather be turned around at 3 o’clock in the morning?” he said. As Magary points out Romney though a Mormon hails from Boston.The Robertsons particularly Phil are outspoken about their Christian faith (each episode of “Duck Dynasty” ends with a prayer) and have also campaigned for Republicans but their show a hit in red and blue states alike is largely nonpolitical and has so far carefully avoided issues such as race and gay rights.The comments could prove to be a headache for A&E which has a ratings winner in “Duck Dynasty.” The August season premiere of the technically unscripted (if carefully edited) series garnered 11.8 million viewers setting a record for a nonfiction cable program and it regularly beats out many shows on broadcast. Season 5 is set to bow Jan. 15.AdvertisementA&E was not immediately available for comment.ALSO:‘Duck Dynasty’s’ Jase Robertson claims he was ‘facially profiled’Is Uncle Si ‘Duck Dynasty’s’ breakout star?AdvertisementCritic’s Notebook: ‘Duck Dynasty’ is a canny curation of culturesTwitter: @MeredithBlake',\n",
       " 'First we have Professor Michael Dorf from Cornell Law School:“If the court thought it was going to get a few years I think they were naïve.”Professor Dorf said there are probably not five votes on the Supreme Court to block Judge Shelby’s ruling. “On the strictly legal argument” he said “it’s hard to justify granting a stay.” But he added that the lower courts should have done so partly because of the potential cruelty of voiding the new marriages and partly because the Supreme Court is hard to predict. “It’s pretty clear that even the five justices who are sympathetic to same-sex marriage would rather take a few years before getting there” Professor Dorf wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. “If their hand is forced as it now will be it’s impossible to say with certainty what they’ll do.”Dorf of course thinks that the lower court and the 10th Circuit should have issued a stay. Now that several hundred couples have been married in Utah that seems more moot than the several hundred couples San Francisco married in 2004.\"Would rather.\" What a pity they\\'re being rushed. Liptak doesn\\'t see this as an issue for this term but sees it for the session that begins in October 2015 (which is what I\\'ve been saying) by which time that will be several thousand couples in Utah not several hundred and several hundred no doubt in Idaho and Colorado and Wyoming because Utah is closer than say New Mexico or Iowa.And yes Liptak points out that the Utah decision was based on a sentence in Scalia\\'s dissent on the Windsor case“The view that this court will take of state prohibition of same-sex marriage is indicated beyond mistaking by today’s opinion”did not impress Jason Mazzone a law professor at the University of Illinois. “His opinion would have appeared considerably more judicial had he resisted the urge to give Justice Scalia the finger” Professor Mazzone wrote in a blog post last Friday.as GrafZeppelin127 and Kalil pointed out here when the decision was published a gesture that as Liptak reportsWell okay!But Michael Klarman a historian at Harvard Law School now thinks two to six years even with the current composition of the court. He doesn\\'t think it\\'s open-ended any more.So Utah has set the wheels in motion for the endgame. Illinois Oregon and New Jersey are in the pipeline now.

       " 'Story highlights Two Jewish sprinters from U.S. kept from running in Nazi Germany in 1936 OlympicsLZ Granderson: The 2014 Olympics taking place in Russia with its extreme anti-gay lawsIn Russia LGBT teens reportedly being kidnapped bullied even killed he saysAll of Congress should sign letter for Russia to ensure LGBT Americans\\' safety he saysUsually when we talk about the 1936 Olympics in Berlin we focus on two men -- Adolf Hitler and Jesse Owens -- and rightfully so. They are the two with an undeniable impact on history albeit in vastly different ways.But in light of President Barack Obama\\'s recent remarks on \"The Tonight Show\" denouncing Russia\\'s new anti-gay laws laws that have led to bloodshed in the streets it is important that we remember Marty Glickman and Sam Stoller.They too were at those games. They too left a mark.You see the day before they were scheduled to run in the 400-meter relay their coach Dean Cromwell replaced them.They were not injured.LZ GrandersonThey did not break any team rules nor were they disqualified for any violations.They were however Jewish and this was Nazi Germany which had adopted the Nuremberg laws limiting Jewish citizens\\' rights a year earlier. Apparently Cromwell along with leaders from the U.S. Olympic Committee decided it would be best if Glickman and Stoller did not compete.At the time I\\'m sure it seemed like a decision that would only hurt the two men. After all the 400 led by Owens still won gold.Today we know better.Today we look at that decision and lower our heads in shame understanding that it made us complicit with something that evolved into a far worse crime than unjustly replacing a pair of sprinters. In the moment when we should have spoken up we remained silent.JUST WATCHED Athletes: Sochi boycott not the answer Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Athletes: Sochi boycott not the answer 01:34JUST WATCHED Obama: Russia must respect gay rights Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Obama: Russia must respect gay rights 02:22JUST WATCHED Olympians jeer Russia\\'s anti-gay law Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Olympians jeer Russia\\'s anti-gay law 06:41And so here we are again: an Olympics on the horizon another host country with recently legislated laws persecuting a group of people and for a while we were silent. And then Tuesday happened.\"I\\'ve been very clear that when it comes to universal rights when it comes to people\\'s basic freedoms that whether you are discriminating on the basis of race religion gender or sexual orientation you are violating the basic morality that I think should transcend every country\" Obama said going on to talk about how Russia\\'s treatment of lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people goes against the spirit of the Olympics.He did not call for a boycott.But on Wednesday he canceled a one-on-one meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin planned for September. The White House cited Russia\\'s decision to grant asylum to National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden and \"lack of progress on issues such as missile defense and arms control\" among other reasons. But it also mentioned human rights issues.Recently U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry received a letter from 88 members of Congress -- Republicans and Democrats -- urging him to do something to guarantee the safety of LGBT Americans visiting Russia during that time. That leaves 447 lawmakers we should be asking why they did not sign that letter.Last month Buzzfeed provided the world photos of LGBT people being violently beaten by anti-gay protesters and police in Russia.Russian officials have said they don\\'t condone the attacks but police have stood by while they happened and then arrested the battered victims for being gay. And because it is unclear whether or not the anti-gay laws will be enforced during the Olympics the safety of all Americans -- because you can be arrested if police think you look gay or even if you support gays -- is in question.Which brings me to: Why aren\\'t the names of all 535 members of Congress on that letter?In talking about the 1936 Olympics I do not equate what is happening in Russia to what happened to Jewish people during World War II. I just want to remind you that the Holocaust did not happen overnight. It was subtle.Surgical.In silence.These new anti-gay laws are disturbingly similar to the anti-Semitic Nuremberg laws Hitler passed before the 1936 Olympics. And with the Pew Institute finding 84% of Russians believe society should reject gay people perhaps some saying they object to gays for fear of arrest the world should question how far Russia intends to go.We should question how far Russia our lukewarm ally intends to go and what our participation in the 2014 Olympic Games will look like generations from now.In one of his final interviews before passing away in 2001 Glickman told the San Diego Jewish Press-Heritage that there had been some talk of boycotting the 1936 Olympics because of Hitler but no one foresaw what would happen to the Jews a short time later.\"There is no way in the world that I would think of going to Nazi Germany\" he said. \"The Holocaust and those things around Nazi Germany which we all loathe weren\\'t in existence in 1936.\"No one can predict the future. But this week Obama showed he learned an important lesson from our Olympic past -- offering silence to appease evil is a senseless endeavor because evil will never be satisfied. Now it\\'s our turn to speak up. There are 447 members of Congress who have yet to sign that letter to Kerry -- we need to be asking why.Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.',\n",
       " 'One of the original stories is at here AlternetThe Presidential Inauguration Committee announced Tuesday that the President Obama has selected Pastor Louie Giglio of the Georgia-based Passion City Church to deliver the benediction for his second inauguration. In a mid-1990s sermon identified as Giglio’s available online on a Christian training Web site he preached rabidly anti-LGBT views. The 54-minute sermon entitled “In Search of a Standard – Christian Response to Homosexuality” advocates for dangerous “ex-gay” therapy for gay and lesbian people references a biblical passage often interpreted to require gay people be executed and impels Christians to “firmly respond to the aggressive agenda” and prevent the “homosexual lifestyle”I can tell you that one of the most hurtful parts of the first Obama administration was asking to have Rick Warren speak at his inaugural. He was giving a platform to someone who spread hate when there were so many other choices there. It was greatly resented by many in the LGBT community. In fact it set off a chain of events (Rev. Robinson \"accidentally\" not being shown on live TV etc.) which got Obama off on very bad footing with many in the LGBT community.Following McClurkin I was very angry with Obama. Then came Warren. But apparently Obama/the inaugural team haven\\'t learned anything:From above Alternet piece:(17:37) Men women I can’t say anything other to you tonight than this that if you look at the counsel of the word of God Old Testament New Testament you come quickly to the conclusion that homosexuality is not an alternate lifestyle… homosexuality is not just a sexual preference homosexuality is not gay but homosexuality is sin. It is sin in the eyes of God and it is sin according to the word of God. You come to only one conclusion: homosexuality is less than God’s best for his creation. It is less than God’s best for us and everything in our lives that is less than God’s best for us and his plan for us and his design for us is sin. That’s God’s voice. If you want to hear God’s voice that is his voice to this issue of homosexuality. It is not ambiguous and unclear. It is very clear.There are numerous other very incendiary quotes.So let me address the naysayers now:- But Obama has done so much for LGBT rights it\\'s just a speaker at the InaugurationUm first if you are trying to make improving LGBT rights a cornerstone of your presidency you don\\'t have to spit in the eye of the people you are supposedly trying to help. This is a PERSONAL choice. Hagel I can somewhat justify because there are other plusses to his candidacy. This is Obama picking yet another bigot when there could be much better choices out there who were/are not so vehemently anti-gayAlso when will he get past this bullshit of making in-roads with these people? These people will always vote against him and his agenda. Why give the marquee moment to a hater- But but he said those things long agoYeah and those are the seeds of hatred which were sown in the very people today who support discrimination against LGBT people.Also if Shirley Sherrod is up for scrutiny for what she didn\\'t even say Hagel for his homophobic remarks they why should this guy not be held accountable as would anything with a history of anti-African American anti-woman anti-Hispanic anti- remarks. Yeah the times are changing and its time for the haters and the Vichy apologists to be held accountable for hating when it was a much bigger trend.And for what it\\'s worth I am against Hagel ALSO for this reason. As Maddow pointed out there will be many many issues involving LGBT people in the military coming up. So he should answer for his bigotry then. Yet another reason why he is a bad choice.- But but Obama has a GAY CUBAN poet speakingAnd this argument pisses me off most of all. In Obama and Co\\'s mind if you put up a minority group that cancels out makes ok having the hater up there. No it doesn\\'t. You don\\'t have a \"mixed program\" by putting up people who have advanced society like Ms. Evers and those who have held it back. Once again we\\'ll likely have an inauguration with the usual symbolic winks and nods to the LGBT community while the hater gets a front row seat.Starting off Obama II in a sucky way like he started off Obama I. Except he can\\'t blame Boehner for this one. A fucking huge disappointment.',\n",
       " '1 / 28 Pat Robertson: Gays With Aids Wear Rings To Cut Infect OthersPat Robertson made an <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pat-robertson-aids-rings_n_3824401\" target=\"_blank\">outrageous comment</a> in August 2013 on an episode of the 700 club in which he claimed that gay people suffering from AIDS in cities such as San Francisco wear \"special rings\" that allow them to cut and infect other individuals with the disease. Right Wing Watch reported that particular comment from the broadcast was edited out of the clip the Christian Broadcasting Network later posted online. The Huffington Post could not immediately reach a CBN representative for comment. “You know what they do in San Francisco? Some in the gay community there they want to get people. So if they got the stuff they’ll have a ring you shake hands and the ring’s got a little thing where you cut your finger” he said. “Really. It’s that kind of vicious stuff which would be the equivalent of murder.”AP',\n",
       " 'Nothing “Duck Dynasty” patriarch Phil Robertson said was anything close to anti-gay. It might have been characteristically blunt but Robertson neither singled out homosexuals nor questioned the humanity of gay people. Robertson focused on sexual behavior including the sexual behavior of heterosexuals. The major media are merely using Robertson’s quotes to advance their own anti-Christian bigotry by smearing Christian beliefs as de facto bigotry and launching a McCarthyist campaign to silence Christians.When you have major media outlets declaratively describing Robertson’s expression of his Christian beliefs as “anti-gay” what you are really seeing is major media outlets outing themselves as anti-Christian.Politico. CNN. The Hollywood Reporter. Entertainment Weekly. Yahoo. Variety. And so on…Robertson listed more than a half-dozen sins other than homosexual behavior including a number of heterosexual behaviors and “the greedy the drunkards the slanderers the swindlers”.It is certainly possible to try to disguise anti-gay bigotry as Christianity. Singling out gay people and not distinguishing between homosexuals as people and homosexual behavior are two of the most glaring examples.But Robertson did neither. What he did do was to speak a Christian truth about various sins and the media know this.Anti-sin is not anti-gay.But because the media and left are desperate to toxify Christianity as bigotry and bully Christians into silence Robertson’s remarks are seen as the perfect opportunity to do both.Of course it is an added benefit to the media to try to tarnish a culturally conservative mega-hit and maybe drive it off the air.What we have here is nothing more than the media practicing McCarthyism and disguising it as tolerance.Notice how the media are not reporting on the most important thing Robertson said:You put in your article that the Robertson family really believes strongly that if the human race loved each other and they loved God we would just be better off. We ought to just be repentant turn to God and let’s get on with it and everything will turn around.Governor Sarah Palin put this exactly right when she said this is an attack on “all of us.”This post has been updated to add a correct Robertson quote about loving the human race.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC',\n",
       " 'FILE - In this Monday Dec. 2 2013 file photo Shaun Campbell left and Tony Singh are congratulated by guests after their wedding at the Sheraton Waikiki in Honolulu. Hawaii became the 15th state to legalize same-sex marriage. The last six months of 2013 have provided a frenzy of court decisions and laws in favor of gay marriage punctuated by a ruling in heavily Mormon Utah that has allowed hundreds of same-sex couples to wed in the last week. The U.S. Supreme Court opened the floodgates with its June ruling that overturned a 1996 ban on gay marriage and the change has been swift. Judges in Utah New Mexico and Ohio have all ruled in favor of gay marriage in the past week. (AP Photo/Marco Garcia File)SALT LAKE CITY (RNS) -- In the week since a federal judge overturned Utah’s ban on same-sex marriage the number of weddings in the state has skyrocketed shattering records and accruing thousands of dollars for Utah’s 29 counties.As of close of business Thursday (Dec. 26) more than 1225 marriage licenses had been issued in Utah since last Friday (Dec. 20). Of those at least 74 percent or 905 licenses were issued to gay and lesbian couples.Marriage licenses in Utah cost between $30 and $50 depending on the county.With an average marriage license costing $40 counties in Utah made a grand total of more than $49000 in the three-and-a-half days most county clerk’s offices were open this week.About three-quarters of that money came from gay and lesbian couples seeking marriage licenses in the immediate aftermath of U.S. District Judge Robert J. Shelby’s ruling that overturned a statewide ban on same-sex marriages.Salt Lake County shattered a previously held record of 85 marriages in a given day by handing out 353 on Monday (Dec. 23) — the first full day of issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.On the other hand Piute a small county of about 1500 people in the center of the state was of several counties with no takers. Had any Piute couples requested a license they would have been denied anyway.County Clerk Valeen Brown is on vacation until Monday (Dec. 30) officials said. So Piute officials suspended all marriage license activity until Brown returns.Utah County — which made national news this week when Shelly Eyre and her partner Cheryl Haws declared that they would sue its clerk for denying gay and lesbian couples — was doling out certificates Thursday to all.“Moving forward we probably won’t keep track of how many same-sex couples versus opposite-sex couples we issue licenses to” said Bryan Thompson the county’s clerk and auditor. “I don’t see any reason to differentiate between them.”(Marissa Lang writes for The Salt Lake Tribune.)',\n",
       " '8 years ago(CNN) – Conservatives who oppose same-sex marriage must accept that they’ve “lost the issue” radio host Rush Limbaugh argued Thursday.“This issue is lost” the conservative firebrand said. “I don\\'t care what the Supreme Court does this is now inevitable - and it\\'s inevitable because we lost the language on this. “Limbaugh went on to assert conservatives “lost the issue when we started allowing the word ‘marriage’ to be bastardized and redefined by simply adding words to it.”“Marriage is one thing and it was not established on the basis of discrimination” he continued. “It wasn\\'t established on the basis of denying people anything. ‘Marriage’ is not a tradition that a bunch of people concocted to be mean to other people with. But we allowed the left to have people believe that it was structured that way. “The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the legality of same-sex marriage earlier this week.Another notable conservative Fox News host Bill O’Reilly said on Tuesday that same-sex marriage advocates have a more convincing argument than opponents who do nothing but rehash scripture to make their point.\"The compelling argument is on the side of homosexuals\" O\\'Reilly said Tuesday on Fox. \"That\\'s where the compelling argument is. \\'We\\'re Americans. We just want to be treated like everybody else.\\' That\\'s a compelling argument and to deny that you have got to have a very strong argument on the other side. The argument on the other side hasn\\'t been able to do anything but thump the Bible.\"O\\'Reilly has previously stated he takes a libertarian view on the issue and repeated Tuesday night that it\\'s a decision that should be left up to the states. \"I support civil unions. I always have. The gay marriage thing I don\\'t feel that strongly about it one way or another.\"',\n",
       " 'Maryland state legislator Don Dwyer is a religious conservative who has called himself \"the face of the opposition\" to gay marriage chastising fellow legislators to reject it because Jeebus and stuff. Most Americans however know this self-proclaimed defender of the Constitution and freedoms and whatnot mostly from his alcohol-fueled boating crash last year (and yes there were injuries and yes he\\'s still facing charges).In this new miserably depressing story on Dwyer he cites two things as the reasons for the \"increased\" drinking that culminated in his crash with another boat causing him multiple injuries and fracturing the skull of a five-year-old girl. The first is his 2011 separation from his wife. The second is the pressure of being in the legislature but more specifically that time other legislators \"betrayed\" him by not being sufficiently anti-gay-marriage themselves:Dwyer says he felt sold out when Dels. Tiffany Alston Wade Kach and Bob Costa voted for same-sex marriage an issue he spent years crusading against. Dwyer told reporters one day before the vote that he had enough support to block the bill. Kach a Republican from Baltimore County and Alston a former Democrat from Prince George’s County voted against the bill in committee. But Kach changed his vote after hearing testimony from gay couples. Alston shifted her vote after her amendment was adopted. Kach and Costa of Deale were the only two House Republicans to vote for the bill. It passed the House by two votes in February. “I had no time to do anything” Dwyer said. “Had I known earlier I could have taken some action.” It was petitioned to the November ballot and passed by 52 percent of voters state wide. Voters in Dwyer’s district however rejected it. “That betrayal really affected me” he said. “I was physically ill. You pour your heart into an issue like that and it’s devastating.” He said his drinking culminated in the crash.So an intense hatred of gay marriage—and not having that hatred reciprocated by his fellow legislators and voters—is what drove this poor defender of proper marriage and proper faith to booze up and crash his damn boat into another boat. That\\'s some powerful hatred right there.In the wake of the crash Dwyer did not resign as any decent person might instead gaudily announcing he needs to stay put to \"defend individual liberty against unconstitutional laws\" but he does admit he needs to rebuild \"trust\" with voters. I don\\'t know that voters should be keen on reelecting someone whose past reaction to other people being insufficiently anti-gay was to booze up and nearly get some people killed but I am not from Maryland I am not a Republican voter and Dwyer seems confident that all will be forgiven allowing him to get back to expressing his obsessively anti-gay frustrations in some hopefully less child-skull-fracturing ways.And that ladies and gentlemen is what it means to be an American religious conservative.',\n",
       " 'I personally think that our country has much bigger problems than debating gay marriage. Severe obesity soaring healthcare costs poverty starving children immigration texting and driving to name a few. You will change your profile pic to show that you are supportive - but what are you ACTUALLY doing to help our country? I promise the supreme court doesn\\'t care about your Facebook profile picture.Every time I see a Facebook status or a tweet that reads like this:I know right away that the person behind the words has no tangible friendship or touchable connection with a person who is gay. I know that the person is speaking from a place devoid of the sort of empathy that comes from truly connecting with a person who is being deprived of rights.Because let me tell you why I changed my profile picture to that small meaningless speck of red peppered with two horizontal bars. I did it not because I think it\\'s going to influence Justice Kennedy\\'s legal opinion. I\\'m a few months shy of being a lawyer so I\\'m in as good a position as anyone to know that matters like this are decided in the reaches of highly analytical and highly calculated minds that sit under black robes.No. I change my profile picture because I have friends who are gay.

I have friends who I\\'ve sat with to discuss the ways in which real-world bigotry keeps them from enjoying a full life. These are people I respect and they are people who deserve respect.And they should know that in their fight in their battle for equality they are not alone. I can\\'t imagine what it must have been like to have been a black person during the 1960s fighting out of second-hand citizenship to a place of at least some equality. If I had been there and I had been black I I might have looked to some of the people I thought were friends and I might have said: \"Are you out there?\"I change my profile picture because unlike you conservative who is only concerned about concepts like \"children starving\" and \"poverty\" when it helps you make a point about the triviality of gay marriage I understand that the freedom of each of us is tied to the freedom of everyone. It\\'s that unmalleable concept that says to my gay friends: your liberation is bound up with mine.I change my profile picture not because I\\'ve forgotten that there are big problems in the world. To the contrary it\\'s because I remember that our problems are big and big problems are only solved by groups of people with the conviction to stand up with one another and for one another.

       " 'It seems these days as if everyone is speculating about how Justice Anthony M. Kennedy will approach the two same-sex marriage cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. But I haven’t heard anyone wondering which side Antonin Scalia will be on. He has made his views on gay relationships painfully clear.In December Scalia spoke at Princeton University where I am a freshman and I asked him about language he used in past decisions involving gay rights — language that I as a gay man found extraordinarily offensive.AdvertisementIn my question I quoted from two of Scalia’s opinions (both of them dissents). One passage came from the case of Romer vs. Evans which involved a Colorado statute banning laws that recognized gay people as a protected class. Scalia wrote: “I had thought that one could consider certain conduct reprehensible — murder for example or polygamy or cruelty to animals — and could exhibit even ‘animus’ toward such conduct. Surely that is the only sort of ‘animus’ at issue here: moral disapproval of homosexual conduct.”PHOTOS: Battle of the gay marriage signsAdvertisementI asked if he had come to regret that language. He hadn’t. In response to my question he posed two questions of his own: “If we cannot have moral feelings against homosexuality can we have it against murder? Can we have it against these other things?”I hadn’t really expected Scalia to apologize for his language. He has been remarkably consistent over his judicial career. Still I had hoped and continue to hope that my question might lead Scalia to think about the language he uses in the soon-to-be-decided cases of U.S. vs. Windsor and Hollingsworth vs. Perry which will determine the fates respectively of the federal Defense of Marriage Act and California’s Proposition 8. I know from personal experience that poisonous language like Scalia’s can be devastatingly hurtful.AdvertisementGrowing up in Northern California I struggled to accept the fact that I was gay. I was labeled a “faggot” in middle school too many times to count. I listened to my neighbor explain how California needed Proposition 8 to “protect the children.” I heard my grandfather declare that San Francisco’s gay community was “just different from the rest of us.” Those words hurt and honestly they still do. Although I am very close to my parents I only felt comfortable coming out to them a month before putting my question to Scalia.TIMELINE: Gay marriage chronologyAdvertisementMore than half of LGBT youth report having been verbally assaulted or attacked with anti-gay slurs. For some it leaves a permanent scar. For others it proves too much to handle which is why an appallingly high number of gay teens commit suicide.I tell myself that verbal assaults are rooted in ignorance. But I still haven’t figured out how to reassure myself when the ignorance is emanating from the nation’s highest court. In the 2003 case of Lawrence vs. Texas the Supreme Court overturned a Texas law banning sodomy. Scalia’s dissent in the case joined by Justice Clarence Thomas and then-Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist embraced the idea that citizens should be able to pass laws banning sexual behavior they find “immoral and unacceptable” including such things as “adult incest bestiality and obscenity.”AdvertisementI have every confidence that history will judge Scalia harshly and that one day it will be unacceptable to equate laws against consensual gay sex with laws against incest and bestiality. But I still worry about the impact of his language in the here and now.OPINION L.A.: For Scalia no gay people just gay sex?AdvertisementIn the next couple of months the court will issue its rulings on Proposition 8 and the Defense of Marriage Act and we’re likely to hear more of his views on the morality of gay relationships. Still I can’t help but hope that this time he will consider how words have the potential to lead people to desperation and self-destruction. Wouldn’t it be great if Scalia surprised us this time?Duncan Hosie is a freshman at Princeton University.',\n",
       " 'The \"debate\" really speaks for itself. There\\'s not much to add except that this homophobe got his ass handed to him by Wahls and walked away from the segment looking like a complete jackass. Watch and enjoy:For those who can\\'t watch here\\'s a transcript:Whelan: Not at all. In fact I think the example I give indicates exactly the opposite. Look what\\'s at issue here is that we have an organization that has long stood in defense of traditional American moral values and it\\'s attracted supporters and parents from churches precisely because it has stood in defense of those values. The Supreme Court has held that the Boy Scouts have a First Amendment constitutional right to pursue their values and to exclude leaders whose presence would be inconsistent with those values. That includes by the way not just gays but atheists. Now we can respect and we do respect our fellow citizens who are gays or atheists. We love our relatives or friends who are gays or atheists. But we are not obligated to regard them as suitable to be Scout leaders.Host: Hm. All right well let me ask Zach to weigh in here. Zach?Wahls: Yeah I think it\\'s interesting that Ed is going to this you know traditional moral values framework. I think what he is trying to do is define this as some particular biblical literal fundamentalist tradition that has become popular in the U.S. over the last forty years. The reality is that there are Christians of all different denominations who are applauding the BSA for this proposed policy change including the United Church of Christ one of the BSA\\'s top eight church sponsors which on Friday issued a statement saying \"The ban is inconsistent with the values of dignity and respect which serve as the foundation of the Scouting program\" and we couldn\\'t agree more. Even though Ed may be talking about respect respect for him is a one-way street. Nobody is calling for the exclusion of Baptists or Mormons or Catholics or frankly anybody who even holds Ed\\'s point of view. What we\\'re trying to say is that Scouts should be an inclusive program experiencing you know a large amount of inclusivity because we believe in the values that constitute the program.Host: Let me ask you about this woman Ed--Jennifer Tyrell. She was kicked out of the Scouts. She is a lesbian mom who was a den leader for her son. Is she a threat?Whelan: Look the question here is whether a private organization can have its own standards for for its leaders.Host: But answer that question first if you will. Is she a threat?Whelan: I don\\'t know this particular woman. How could I possibly judge whether she\\'s a threat? The fact of the matter is that organizations have all sorts of general rules that they adopt because the rules are sensible and we don\\'t have to defend every single application of every particular rule. The problem here is that the Boy Scouts if they adopt this notion that different troops can have different policies it\\'s completely unworkable it\\'s going to invite legal attacks on the troops that maintain the traditional policies and Zach and his cohorts are not going to call a peace truce. They\\'re going to realize that the Boy Scouts can be intimidated and they\\'re going to continue to intimidate them and this is an unstable stopping point--it\\'s just a path to further surrender.Wahls: Speaking as an Eagle Scout and somebody who actually spent twelve years in the organization I simply have to disagree. We\\'re appealing to the traditional values that have been a part of the Boy Scouts from their very inception in 1903 and I feel that moving forward this is going to be a part of the program that is fostering inclusiveness and applying the values and the lifelong principles of the Boy Scouts to the entire you know population of young American men not just those who happen to be straight. And further on your point of whether or not this is something that is an unworkable legal solution on a national call with the key three of the Boy Scouts earlier this week the president of the board said \"With the current ban in place we don\\'t want to find ourselves in a position in which a judge is telling us that we need to expand our policy even further than we\\'re going here.\" So even though you might be you know looking at this in one specific way the BSA certainly isn\\'t taking that position at all.Host: Ed let me ask you because I know you mentioned this change in policy would deprive the troops of protection. Protection from what? What do they need protection from?Whelan: They need protection from legal challenges to their decision to exclude gay leaders. The national Supreme Court organization won that victory thirteen years ago. They\\'re throwing it away in a way that would expose local troops and volunteer leaders to lawsuits by activists like Zach.Host: Would you want your son to be in the Scouts if he was gay?Whelan: [long pause] Uh I think a question like that directed at my son is a rude question but let me answer it this way. I would not have put my son in a troop with an openly gay leader or an openly atheist leader. And lots and lots of other parents the most vibrant part of the Boy Scouts feel the same. So Zach can cite you know one liberal denomination that is satisfied with this proposal. There are plenty of other folks who aren\\'t and I think the Boy Scouts--Wahls: That\\'s an interesting point--Whelan: Please let me finish. This I think would be an epic failure in leadership if they were to cave to the financial pressure that Zach and others are putting on them. This isn\\'t a decision being made on the merits--this is a decision that is being made in the face of financial pressure the almighty buck and what sort of lesson is it to Scouts that the national organization would cave because of financial pressure rather than adhere to principle?Host: Let me let Zach jump in here with the final word.Wahls: I mean yeah to be clear it\\'s not just the UCC that has weighed in. Currently the Mormon Church and Catholic Church hardly denominations known for their liberal stances have both declined to comment. Only the Baptists--Whelan: [angrily] They\\'re not going to approve this! Don\\'t you dare suggest they\\'re going to approve this!Host: Ed let Zach finish.Wahls: No I mean the point is simply that while there may be some who are you know very opposed to this policy position there is a vast difference between being opposed to gay marriage and opposing the enrichment and development of young men because they happen to be not straight. So while I think Ed\\'s position is you know certainly one that I will respect and we\\'re not going to remove his son from the program I think he should understanding that Scouts is about respecting the opinions of all the people who want to be members not just some.Whelan: You\\'re not respecting it you\\'re trying to--Host: Appreciate your time.

Clarion-LedgerMississippi approved a state constitutional amendment banning gay marriage in 2004Supreme Court is expected to rule on two cases any day nowGay couples have various experiences in the stateJACKSON Miss. -- Mississippi stands to be caught in the crossfire of what could be one of the most high-profile cases since Brown v. Board of Education the landmark 1954 Supreme Court ruling that ended segregation. The issue: gay marriage. Any day now the U.S. Supreme Court will issue rulings on two cases one determining states\\' rights to define marriage and the other questioning the role of the federal government in recognizing same-sex unions.And while Mississippians answered the question of gay marriage in 2004 by overwhelmingly approving a state constitutional amendment banning the practice the aftershock of the Supreme Court rulings on California\\'s Proposition 8 and the federal Defense of Marriage Act could weaken or obliterate the state\\'s stance on the issue.Or the nation\\'s high court could reaffirm what Mississippi and 30 other states already have done in passing the bans.Which way the typically 5-4 split court is leaning is anybody\\'s guess.Three Mississippi couples explain their experiences.Leslie & Cheryl: A life of laughter loveThe story of Leslie Criss and Cheryl Sproles began decades ago when a neighborly gesture formed a friendship that would last forever.They didn\\'t know the chance encounter would end with a happily ever after. But then again who sees Cupid\\'s arrow before it hits?A few decades ago Criss was home for the summer from college visiting her family in Brookhaven Miss. The Criss clan had just moved to the area and there was concern that Criss\\' younger sister Beth wouldn\\'t know anyone at school.Family friends hatched a plan. Sproles would go meet Beth and befriend her ensuring she didn\\'t start the new academic year at the local school without any friends.\"She knocks on the door and my sister and I – both shy girls – answer the door where she says \\'Hi I\\'m Cheryl Sproles. I\\'m the most popular girl in town and I\\'m here to be your friend\\' \" said Criss.There were no fireworks no pledges of undying love no Pavarotti playing in the background. The shy girl and the popular girl became friends and nothing more.As the years passed the friendship remained intact. Criss spent time in Los Angeles a move she said she felt she needed to get out of her system. Sproles moved to New York City to pursue acting. Life happened and the two went right along with it.Eventually both of their paths led them back to Mississippi.When she was 39 Criss said she admitted something to herself that she spent a lifetime denying.\"I knew when I was a third-grader a shy scared third-grader I knew that something was different about me\" Criss said. \"But I knew instinctively that whatever made me know I was different was something that I should shove deep inside and never talk about.\"A conversation with an Episcopalian minister in Corinth Miss. was her next step she said. \"It was the most freeing empowering moment of my life.\"Meanwhile Sproles had her own personal journey to find herself.\"With me I didn\\'t have any idea\" she said. \"I guess some people know it in the third grade. I was living in New York. I knew it was a lifestyle or something (but) being raised in the Baptist Church it was not a possibility.\"When I moved to New York and was introduced to different faiths and different people it was just kind of eye-opening\" Sproles said. \"I don\\'t want to make it sound like New York made me realize I was gay but I had an intern and she said she had a crush on me and I had all these feelings happen.\"Nearly six years ago Criss was at her job with the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal in Tupelo a job she still holds.Sproles had suffered a stroke a year before that eventually selling her business in Jackson and starting her recovery. One day while driving through Tupelo Sproles said she looked up her old friend.\"I asked her out to lunch\" Sproles said. \"And we\\'ve been together pretty much ever since.\"Sproles moved to Tupelo. About a year later the couple held a commitment ceremony.It was an experience Criss thought she\\'d never have.But there they were surrounded by family in a small ceremony that announced their intentions to live life to the fullest with each other.\"I have never laughed as much as I have the last six years\" Criss said. \"We\\'ve had some sad times too.\"\"Yeah we have\" Sproles said.Nowadays the self-diagnosed shy Criss has an infectious grin on her face. The woman who had been content sitting in the audience stood on a theater stage during a recent production of \"To Kill A Mockingbird\" an idea encouraged by her theatrical partner.And Sproles a woman who has a million faces and hilarious quips pauses from time to time to stare lovingly at the woman who anchors her life while keeping her free spirit intact.It\\'s the work of each woman wives in everything but name only.Amelie & Sabrina: A proud familyNorth Mississippi can be described as one of the most conservative areas in one of the most conservative states. But for Amelie Hahn and Sabrina Mays it\\'s home.It\\'s where the two met three years ago while working for the U.S. Census Bureau\\'s big count. Mississippi — Houston specifically — is where the couple held a commitment ceremony.\"She walked in and she wouldn\\'t give me the time of day\" said Hahn of the couple\\'s first encounter. \"I tried to talk to her and she wouldn\\'t speak to me pay me any attention at all.\"At their first meeting Hahn made paper footballs flipping them in Mays\\' direction. It was a schoolyard attempt to get a crush to look up.Instead Mays kept on texting focusing her attention on her phone she was holding underneath the table.Hahn however wasn\\'t going to give up.She looked around and found a softball league choosing to get involved. Of course it didn\\'t hurt that Mays was a player.And sometime between whizzing paper footballs past Mays\\' head to throwing softballs around together Hahn got the attention she wanted.She also got a partner.Mississippi is where the two hard-working moms raise their daughters Haley 14 and Jessa 13.And it\\'s also a place where the family sometimes feels the sting of disapproval.\"I don\\'t like the dirty looks I don\\'t like that when we walk by people talk about me\" Hahn said.\"Most of my friends are pretty cool about it\" Jessa said. \"I\\'ve never had anyone not be my friend because of it.\"There are a couple of friends whose parents don\\'t allow their children to visit the Hahn-Mays house. \"But that\\'s their problem\" Jessa said.Even with some of the stares the family is determined to stay put. At least in some part of Mississippi.\"We\\'re comfortable here\" said Hahn adding she and her family want to move to Jackson a place she describes as being more open than Houston and closer to the hospital where they take Haley a special needs child.In the meantime the family will continue to make an example of themselves a testament to their normalcy.\"What we\\'re going to have to do is make our presence known and get people to see us as human beings because that\\'s what we are you know we\\'re a family just like any other family\" Hahn said. \"We get up in the morning we eat breakfast the kids go to school she goes to work I start my school work.\"And Hahn said her family is the reason she will stay and take a stand.\"If we leave then that\\'s one less couple to stand up and speak out.\"Eddie & Justin: A living exampleGrowing up gay in the South isn\\'t easy for many members of the LGBT community but the times they are changing.Eddie Outlaw and Justin McPherson have carved out their own little piece of Jackson the city where they have lived the last nine years. It\\'s where their home is their friends are and their business operates.McPherson said the evidence can be seen by younger Mississippians able to come out in high school to openly discuss their sexuality with their parents.\"I will put my life out there as an example of what this looks like\" said McPherson 32. \"It does get better.\"When he was coming out as a teenager \"it was real bad then and it\\'s done nothing but improve and will continue to improve.\"\"I guess for a teenager looking at what\\'s happening right now -- from (President Barack Obama) to most of the Democrats in the Senate saying they are for marriage equality and overturning (the Defense of Marriage Act) it sends a message\" said Outlaw 41.McPherson said he wants to show that by owning a business while being openly gay that there is life after coming out.\"I know what it\\'s like growing up in the South. Eddie knows what its like to grow up in the South\" he said. \"I want to be an example for them for their parents.\"\"Instead of a paso doble\" said Outlaw referring to a traditional Spanish dance \"we\\'ve settled into a slow steady waltz. We found something that works for us.\"',\n",
       " 'The New York Times calls for a \"50-state ruling\":Support now for same-sex marriage — more than half in favor about one-third against — is roughly the public divide on the question of public school desegregation in 1954 when the Supreme Court outlawed segregated schools in Brown v. Board of Education. But the court’s call then for states to end racial discrimination in public schools “with all deliberate speed” was a big error. It gave states far too much latitude to move slowly and gave them an excuse for resistance which delayed desegregation in many school districts for many years. The court should avoid that kind of error in the same-sex-marriage cases. It should broadly declare that under the Constitution the right to marry applies equally to all couples period and that this principle applies to the federal government and every state.The arguments of those defending discrimination against gay couples are beyond far-fetched. Proposition 8’s advocates for example contend that restricting marriage to heterosexual couples must be rational because for thousands of years people widely agreed that the institution involved only the union of a man and a woman. That reasoning stinks of the faulty logic used to justify the persistence of all sorts of discrimination. They also argue that marriage’s purpose is to ensure that children are born into stable families; therefore California should be allowed to limit marriage to only those capable of biological procreation. That is a narrow and insulting view of marriage. Would it then be constitutional to deny sterile heterosexual couples the right to marry? How about older couples? Moreover lesbians can bear children and gay men can adopt. Why wouldn’t society want their parents to be wed too?Statistically speaking Franklin County should be straighter than John Wayne eating Chick-fil-A. The middle-of-nowhere rectangle in southwest Mississippi -- known for its pine forests hog hunting and an infamous hate crime -- is home to exactly zero same-sex couples according to an analysis of census data. In other words: It\\'s a place where gays don\\'t exist. At least not on paper. [...] In a place where \"everybody knows everybody\" as Richard Pickett put it very few seem willing to talk about the possibility of gay residents. You could blame that on the would-be gays. \"If (a gay couple) did live together they would probably keep it quiet\" the 54-year-old told me. \"They\\'re not going to march up and down the street with a sign\" announcing their homosexuality. The common Franklin County wisdom seems to be that gays like unicorns or dragons are living over the next pine-covered hill out of sight and out of mind. They\\'re not my kids. Not my neighbors. They\\'re somewhere else. Maybe. But here\\'s the thing: There certainly are gay people in Franklin County. And for the most part they\\'re not in the closet. Many are happy to talk about it. It\\'s their neighbors and families who aren\\'t.The GOP filibuster strategy is proving to be the tool of choice for draining momentum from President Obama’s reelection mandate. It stops the Democratic majority in the senate from controlling the Senate. And it makes it difficult for the president to put his nominees in place to govern the country. The GOP is betting that voters will blame Democrats for the dysfunction in Congress as much as they blame the GOP. And so far the bet is paying off because the press is failing to call out the GOP for an extreme and nasty political strategy of demanding a super-majority of 60 votes —the votes required to break a filibuster — to get anything done.A lawsuit the federal government filed against JP Morgan in late 2011 alleged the bank consistently overstated the quality of the loans it packaged into mortgage bonds; that it inflated home values to make mortgages seem safer than they were; and that JP Morgan and its brokers didn’t adhere to their own underwriting standards. Federal lawsuits against other Wall Street banks made similar claims. Post-crisis investigations have revealed that outside auditors told banks that they were handling bad mortgages but the banks stuffed them into bonds and sold them off anyway. The banks did all this while knowing they would have to own any mortgage fraud that investors discovered. Just imagine what they’ll be tempted to pull once they let themselves off that hook.There comes a point when some folks prove themselves so careless so consistently with the facts that the rest of us should have license to ignore any additional utterance ever to leak from their lips. That time has come with regard to Michele Bachmann. The not-so-esteemed congresswoman from Minnesota crossed a new threshold last week (just how many thresholds can there be?) when she blasted President Obama’s lavish lifestyle of “excess” (a claim of such lavish excess itself that it prompted even Bill O’Reilly to dress her down for it) and called for a repeal of the Affordable Health Care Act “before it literally kills women kills children kills senior citizens.” Breathtaking. And I don’t mean that in a positive way.Meanwhile the editors at The Washington Post join in and also write a long editorial supporting marriage equality:Over at CNN John D.

       " 'WASHINGTON — Public opinion on marriage for gay and lesbian couples has shifted with almost unprecedented speed since California voters banned such unions in 2008.That shift could influence the Supreme Court in particular Justice Anthony M. Kennedy and possibly Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. as it decides whether to uphold Proposition 8 in coming months.AdvertisementThroughout his long career Kennedy has been willing to make major changes in the law on issues including the death penalty gun rights and gay rights. Kennedy has been a strong steady proponent of constitutional principles such as free speech individual liberty and limits on government power.But before signing on to major changes — abolishing the death penalty for young murderers for example — he has wanted to feel comfortable thatthe change was in line with public opinion and the trend in the law.Advertisement“Among all the justices he is most concerned about public opinion” New York University law professor Barry Friedman said of Kennedy. “The more there is a groundswell of support for gay marriage the more it is likely he will vote to support it.”Kennedy along with others on the court probably would also resist going too fast. The current justices both liberals and conservatives say the court of the early 1970s made a mistake by striking down all state laws on abortion and capital punishment. Both decisions appeared to trigger a backlash and the death penalty was soon restored to law.AdvertisementBetter to move in line with — or just slightly ahead of — shifting opinion they believe.In California public opinion clearly has shifted since Proposition 8 passed in 2008 and banned same-sex marriage. A Field Poll survey released this week showed that California voters by a nearly 2-1 margin now approve of allowing same-sex couples to marry a finding in line with states that legalized gay marriage in November’s election.AdvertisementWith that shift lawyers supporting same-sex marriage have offered the justices a range of options they could use to rule in favor of gay rights. The Obama administration’s legal brief advocates a step-by-step approach.Commenting Friday on the administration’s filing in the case President Obama told reporters: “I do think that we’re seeing on a state-by-state basis progress being made — more and more states recognizing same-sex couples and giving them the opportunity to marry and maintain all the benefits of marriage that heterosexual couples do.” But he added the administration wanted to “answer the specific question” before the court — whether “the California law is unconstitutional.”AdvertisementIn providing that answer Solicitor Gen. Donald Verrilli Jr. drew on arguments he had filed with the court just a few days earlier saying the justices should strike down part of the Defense of Marriage Act which denies federal benefits to legally married gay couples in states such as Massachusetts. He advised the court to say that discrimination based on a person’s sexual orientation is highly suspect akin to gender bias. It can be justified only if a state can show a strong need to treat gays and lesbians differently than other citizens the administration argued.Verrilli’s brief filed Thursday applied that same approach in the Proposition 8 case. It argues that because California and seven other states — Delaware Hawaii Illinois Nevada New Jersey Oregon and Rhode Island — already have given gay couples full legal rights there is no justification for denying them a right to marry.AdvertisementThis is what some lawyers have dubbed the “eight-state solution.”Already nine other states and the District of Columbia authorize same-sex marriage. If the Supreme Court were to adopt the administration’s view it could raise the total to 17 mostly in the Northeast and on the West Coast.AdvertisementWhile this would be a significant ruling it would not require Justice Kennedy and his colleagues to mandate gay marriage in the red states where majority opinion continues to oppose it.The defenders of Proposition 8 also cite the change in public opinion but argue it is a reason for the court to stand aside. Because there is a great national debate over gay marriage and some states are changing their laws the court has no need to intervene they said.AdvertisementAndy Pugno general counsel for the Proposition 8 proponents said it was “very disappointing” that the Obama administration had urged the court to strike down the voter initiative. “The president has impugned the motives of millions of Californians” he said “and disregarded the rights of each state to decide for itself whether to redefine marriage.”If the court were to adopt a version of the eight-state solution it would allow most states to decide for themselves as Pugno advocates — at least for now. But it is also true that if the justices decided discrimination against gays violates the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection of the laws that same argument eventually could be used to invalidate the remaining state laws against same-sex marriage. The justices might be particularly willing to do so if the majority of states already had acted.AdvertisementIn 1967 the Supreme Court ruled that laws barring mixed-race couples from marriage violated the Constitution. By then only 16 states still had such laws on their books.david.savage@latimes.com',\n",
       " 'GRAPEVINE Texas (AP) — In one of their most dramatic choices in a century local leaders of the Boy Scouts of America voted Thursday on whether to ease a divisive ban and allow openly gay boys to be accepted into the nation\\'s leading youth organization.Whether yes or no the result will bitterly disappoint many. The decision expected Thursday evening could trigger defections among those on the losing side.Casting ballots were about 1400 voting members of BSA\\'s National Council who were attending their annual meeting at a conference center not far from BSA headquarters in suburban Dallas.At stake was a proposal drafted by the BSA\\'s governing executive committee that says boys could no longer be excluded from Scouting solely on the basis of sexual orientation. A longstanding ban on gay adult leaders would remain in place.Whatever the outcome the vote will not end the wrenching debate over the Scouts\\' membership policy.Some conservative churches that sponsor Scout units want to continue excluding gay youths and in some cases have threatened to leave the BSA if the ban were lifted.More liberal Scout leaders — while supporting the proposal to accept gay youth — have made clear they want the ban on gay adults lifted as well. If the full no-gays policy is maintained some units in liberal areas may consider either leaving the Scouts or openly defying the ban.However the vote goes the BSA could take a hit financially. Many Scout units in conservative areas fear their local donors will stop giving if the ban on gay youth is lifted while many major corporate donors are likely to withhold donations if the ban remains.In January the BSA executive committee suggested a plan to give sponsors of local Scout units the option of admitting gays as both youth members and adult leaders or continuing to exclude them. However the plan won little praise and the BSA changed course after assessing responses to surveys sent out starting in February to members of the Scouting community.Story continuesOf the more than 200000 leaders parents and youth members who responded 61 percent supported the current policy of excluding gays while 34 percent opposed it. However most parents of young Scouts as while as youth members themselves opposed the ban.In the weeks leading up to the vote and on Wednesday as National Council members arrived in Grapevine advocacy groups on both sides of the debate organized news conferences photo opportunities and forums to make their case.Two conservative groups opposed to any easing of the ban — the Family Research Council and OnMyHonor.net — placed an ad Thursday in the Dallas Morning News warning that lifting the ban on gay youth would trigger lawsuits that could force the BSA to admit gay adults as well as youth. It said lifting the ban on gay boys could drive out as many as 400000 of the Scouts\\' youth members.The BSA\\'s overall \"traditional youth membership\" — Cub Scouts Boy Scouts and Venturers — is now about 2.6 million compared with more than 4 million in peak years of the past. It also has about 1 million adult leaders and volunteers.Of the more than 100000 Scouting units in the U.S. 70 percent are chartered by religious institutions. Those include liberal churches opposed to any ban on gays but some of the largest sponsors are relatively conservative denominations that have previously supported the broad ban — notably the Roman Catholic Church the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Southern Baptist churches.The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced in April that it was satisfied with new proposal and the National Catholic Committee on Scouting has not opposed it.However 50 leaders of other conservative religious groups have issued a statement imploring the National Council to retain the full ban warning that easing it \"would open the Scouts to a wide range of open sexual expressions.\"The signatories included the leaders of the Assemblies of God the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary and the Southern Baptist Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission.The BSA which celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2010 has long excluded both gays and atheists.Protests over the no-gays policy gained momentum in 2000 when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the BSA\\'s right to exclude gays. Scout units lost sponsorships by public schools and other entities that adhered to nondiscrimination policies and several local Scout councils made public their displeasure with the policy.___Crary reported from New York.___Online:BSA Membership Standards Resolution: http://bit.ly/185yyXk___Follow David Crary on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/craryapFollow Nomaan Merchant on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/nomaanmerchant',\n",
       " 'Before the Supreme Court justices turned to the merits of the case on Proposition 8 California’s ban on same-sex marriage they seemed perplexed by a procedural issue: whether the petitioners had legal standing to appeal a lower-court ruling that struck down the ballot measure. Having taken the appeal they cannot easily decide to avoid the substantive question of whether same-sex couples have a constitutionally protected right to marry in California and elsewhere in the country.If the court decides the case on the merits it is hard to imagine that a majority could be swayed by the arguments offered by Charles Cooper the lawyer for the marriage ban’s supporters. Even if his presentation had been more fluent there was no way to overcome the incoherence of his position.The core of Mr. Cooper’s argument was that a ruling allowing same-sex marriage would be “redefining” marriage in a way that undermines the “responsible procreation” of children. Yet California allows same-sex couples to adopt children and many heterosexual couples who can’t have children get married.When Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked him if — outside the marriage context — he could “think of any other rational basis reason for a state using sexual orientation as a factor in denying homosexuals benefits or imposing burdens” he could not. When Justice Elena Kagan asked him to describe “what harm to the institution of marriage or to opposite-sex couples” would occur if same-sex couples were allowed to marry he failed to provide a single example. He also contended that “debate over whether the age-old definition of marriage should be changed to include same-sex couples” should be left to the states but could not explain why the Constitution would permit this kind of discrimination.',\n",

       " 'Richard Wolf and David Jackson USA TODAYPresident%27s %27evolution%27 on same-sex marriage is now completeJustice Department says gays%2C lesbians have equal right to wedCourt%27s historic debates scheduled for March 26-27WASHINGTON — The Obama administration came out forcefully Thursday against California\\'s ban on same-sex marriage and by extension implicated similar bans in 37 other states.In a brief to the Supreme Court which will hear two landmark same-sex marriage cases in late March the Justice Department argued that gay and lesbian couples should have the same right to marry as heterosexuals.\"The government seeks to vindicate the defining constitutional ideal of equal treatment under the law\" Attorney General Eric Holder said. \"Throughout history we have seen the unjust consequences of decisions and policies rooted in discrimination.\"The brief marks the first time the administration has weighed in on the constitutionality of any state ban on gay marriage. Although it was aimed at the voter initiative passed in California in 2008 it put the administration squarely against other such prohibitions. It urged the court to subject the state\\'s ban to a difficult legal standard that no state prohibition is likely to meet.In particular the brief implicated the other states that like California allow domestic partnerships or civil unions: Delaware Hawaii Illinois Nevada New Jersey Oregon and Rhode Island.\"The designation of marriage ... confers a special validation of the relationship between two individuals and conveys a message to society that domestic partnerships or civil unions cannot match\" the brief states. \"Proposition 8\\'s denial of marriage to same-sex couples particularly where California at the same time grants same-sex partners all the substantive rights of marriage violates equal protection.\"Theodore Boutrous a partner in the law firm Gibson Dunn which is representing the two same-sex couples who filed the case initially said the administration\\'s arguments represent \"a clear path to marriage equality across the United States.\"The court filing completes President Obama\\'s self-described evolution on gay marriage and puts his administration squarely on the side of gay rights groups and the nine states where same-sex marriage is legal.The president opposed California\\'s ban Proposition 8 during his 2008 campaign but refused to endorse gay marriage. He made that endorsement during last year\\'s campaign but said the issue should be decided by the states.Then in evocative language in this year\\'s inaugural address Obama equated gay rights to past battles on behalf of women and African Americans by mentioning Stonewall the New York City bar that was the site of 1969\\'s historic gay rights riots.\"Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law\" Obama said. \"For if we are truly created equal then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.\"The action was heralded by groups that seek to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide.\"President Obama and the solicitor general have taken another historic step forward consistent with the great civil rights battles of our nation\\'s history\" said Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin co-founder of the American Foundation for Equal Rights which brought the challenge to Proposition 8.Conservative groups criticized the decision to weigh in against the gay marriage ban particularly since Obama once said it should be left to the states. Tony Perkins president of the Family Research Council said the president was \"putting allegiance to extreme liberal social policies ahead of constitutional principle.\"The high court has reserved two days in late March to consider the California ban on gay marriage and the Defense of Marriage Act which denies federal benefits to legally married same-sex couples. Both have been declared unconstitutional by lower courts decisions which are being challenged by gay-marriage opponents.Proposition 8 was approved by California voters in November 2008 to block a state Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage. Ever since gay couples have been blocked from marrying in the nation\\'s most populous state. A final ruling overturning the ban would open the floodgates to thousands of new same-sex marriages there.What effect a court ruling striking down Proposition 8 would have on other states is not clear. The justices could rule narrowly as a federal appeals court did holding only that voters cannot take away a right previously enjoyed however briefly by Californians. But a more sweeping decision declaring marriage rights for gays and lesbians would endanger all state bans.The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) was passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton in 1996 as a response to a Hawaii Supreme Court ruling that questioned the denial of a marriage license to a same-sex couple. The federal law has blocked legally married couples from receiving federal benefits in Connecticut Iowa Maine Maryland Massachusetts New Hampshire New York Vermont Washington and the District of Columbia.The administration is leading the effort to overturn DOMA in the case of Edith Windsor an 83-year-old New York widow who was forced to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in estate taxes when her lesbian spouse died in 2009. Had she been married to a man she would have faced no inheritance tax.The new filing is more significant however because the administration did not have to get involved at all. Two same-sex couples are contesting Proposition 8 along with the state of California while organizations that promoted the 2008 voter initiative are defending it.In the Windsor case the Justice Department\\'s brief argues that gays and lesbians have been subjected to a long history of discrimination and it refers specifically to the California marriage ban as an example.On the subject of states\\' rights vs. the Constitution its brief to the Supreme Court states: \"Deference to the democratic process must give way to the fundamental constitutional command of equal treatment under law.\"Polls have been shifting toward approval of gay marriage. In a December USA TODAY survey 53% of Americans said same-sex couples deserve the same marriage rights as heterosexual couples up from 40% in 2009.California\\'s ban has attracted 37 \"friend of the court\" briefs mostly from conservative and religious groups. Opponents of the ban have until today to file their briefs and until Friday in the Defense of Marriage Act case. They were coming in from a variety of groups on the political left and right:',\n",
       " 'SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — For Mina Meyer and Sharon Raphael two women in their 70s who fell in love more than four decades ago and have been married for more than four years the U.S. Supreme Court\\'s pending consideration of a law that prohibits the federal government from recognizing unions like theirs is about more than civil rights. It\\'s about buying a new roof for their California home replacing their 2005 Toyota Camry and ensuring Meyer doesn\\'t take a financial hit if Raphael dies first.The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments this month in a challenge to a provision of the Defense of Marriage Act or DOMA that denies legally married gay and lesbian couples federal benefits available to heterosexual married couples including tax and Social Security benefits. A decision is not expected until the end of June but accountants and tax attorneys anticipating the 18-year-old law\\'s demise are already encouraging same-sex couples like Raphael and Meyer to seek prospective tax refunds back retirement payments and other spousal subsidies they may have been denied.It is unclear how the justices might rule but the Obama administration and former President Bill Clinton who signed the act into law have urged the court to overturn it on grounds that it violates the civil rights of gay Americans. DOMA supporters including House Republicans led by Speaker John Boehner argue that Congress — not the court — should decide as public opinion for same-sex marriage grows. Other conservative groups argue that spousal benefits should be reserved only for couples of the opposite sex.Part of the urgency for couples to act stems from deadlines established under the U.S. tax code which gives taxpayers three years to file protective claims for income and estate tax refunds. Same-sex couples or surviving spouses who were legally married before or during 2009 would therefore have until April 15 of this year to submit amended returns claiming overpayments on income for that tax year said Vickie Henry a senior staff attorney at Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders.Story continuesAt the time gay unions were legal in Massachusetts Connecticut Iowa and Vermont and briefly had been in California. New York and the District of Columbia which have since legalized same-sex unions also recognized marriages performed in other states or countries.While married couples from those jurisdictions would have the strongest cases couples from states such as Hawaii Nevada and Illinois that treat domestic partnerships and civil unions as the same as marriage for tax purposes might also see federal refunds depending on how the Supreme Court rules said Pat Cain a federal tax expert at the Santa Clara University School of Law.\"On the income tax side anybody who would benefit from filing jointly and who would be eligible to do so if DOMA falls should consider filing amended tax returns for the applicable years\" Cain said.The sums at stake are not inconsequential. The case the justices accepted for example involves a New York state widow Edith Windsor 83 who is seeking a refund of the $363000 she had to pay in estate taxes after her wife Thea Spyer died in 2009. If Windsor had not been married to another woman her tax bill would have been $0 because married U.S. citizens are allowed to pass their assets onto their spouses tax-free — but only if the surviving spouse is of the opposite sex.Gerald McIntyre directing attorney at the National Senior Citizens Law Center said Social Security benefits which kick in based on the date of application are where gay couples have lost the most and stand the most to gain.Lower-earning spouses such as Meyer have been doubly penalized under DOMA McIntrye said first by being unable to claim the spousal benefit that allows married heterosexuals to increase their monthly benefits by drawing half of a husband or wife\\'s Social Security then being deemed ineligible for survivor benefits that are equal to what a deceased spouse got in retirement each month.A 2009 study by The Williams Institute a think tank on sexual orientation and the law at the University of California Los Angeles estimated that gay couples received an average of $3060 less a year in Social Security benefits than married straight couples. For lesbian couples the disparity rose to $5412. The same study found that gay or lesbian widows or widowers lost out on more than $5700 a year in survivor benefits than their straight counterparts received.In the case of retirees Raphael and Meyer it could mean an additional $7335 year in Social Security benefits because Meyer who worked in office jobs and a bookstore would be entitled to the Social Security benefits of Raphael who earned considerably more as a college professor for 40 years. That would boost their fixed monthly income by about 10 percent. Last year on the advice of a professional colleague and with the high court poised to decide if DOMA is constitutional Meyer applied for more than a year\\'s worth of retroactive benefits as well as bigger future checks if the law is struck down.\"This is not the only money we live on but it does make a big difference\" said Meyer 73 who also would see her Social Security checks more than quadruple in the event she is widowed and the court overturns the act. \"That $700 a month is $700 a month.\"Other married same-sex couples may end up paying more in taxes if DOMA is overturned due to the so-called federal \"marriage penalty.\" Janis Cowhey McDonagh a tax attorney in the New York office of accounting firm Marcum LLP (equals) has been encouraging many of her clients in same-sex marriages to get their returns in order before the Supreme Court rules.\"If it\\'s better for them to file single even though they are married I tell them they need to file before DOMA comes down because if DOMA comes down they won\\'t have the choice\" she said.___Follow Lisa Leff on Twitter at: https://twitter.com/scoopscout',\n",
       " 'The approximately 500 “Justice For Trayvon” protesters in Washington D.C. on Saturday heard calls from progressive speakers for specific boycott actions they want to use force Florida and other states to eliminate “Stand Your Ground” laws.Even though such self-defense laws were not used in George Zimmerman’s defense comedian and veteran progressive activist Dick Gregory argued at the rally outside the federal courthouse in Washington on Constitution Avenue that people should fight against them. Gregory also praised protesters who staged a sit-in until they could meet with Florida Gov. Rick Scott who has agreed to meet with the protesters but continues standing strong on Florida’s Stand Your Ground law. Gregory called for protesters to join musician Stevie Wonder in boycotting Florida.We say thanks to brother Stevie Wonder. For all of his gigs he pays $100000 tax. So you see what he’s giving up. We sit around arguing about so and so is not doing this reverend is not doing this I don’t hear you talking about Stevie. He didn’t have to huddle with nobody. He didn’t have to go to New York and huddle with white agents and say “Can I do this?” So what can we do to help Stevie? We don’t have to ask the First National Bank. We don’t have to ask Congress. We can make our decision when we leave here today because that governor of Florida said last night “Hear me hear me!” He said “I’ll meet with them but nothing is going to change.” And he met with them and he said if the deal was passed again he would sign it. Well we got a message for you.Some members of the crowd jumped in and started shouting “Boycott Florida! Boycott Florida!”Gregory made the argument that supporters of Trayvon Martin should take action by not acting. “Whoa. Hang on” he said. “Let me say something. Let me say something. See that’s what you mean. Some of y’all ain’t been to Florida in your life and ain’t going. And all you got to do is get Florida to come to you. Now what do I mean by that? They got oranges that they can’t afford to have you not buy because they will rot.”“You leave here now and you get on the phone and you call people and tell them to call people” he continued. “I said to my grandmother ‘We not going to boycott Florida orange juice because Florida orange juice is sold under different names. We going to boycott orange juice.’ And when them orange growers start running in to take that governor and he knows he can’t stand his ground with them. This is who we are. Starting thinking about Christmas. You know it’s hard to get us to do something.”Gregory called for people to boycott Disney as well since it is based in Orlando Fla. “How many of y’all have been to Disneyland to see a rat?” Gregory said referencing Mickey Mouse to laughter from the several hundred in attendance. “But haven’t walked down the street to see King’s tomb? Had he not died you wouldn’t be welcome in Orlando. So we not asking you to do anything that costs you. We just say save your money. Don’t spend it. And when they understand who you are then things will stop happening.” Disneyland is located in Anaheim CA. Disneyworld is located in Orlando FL.Gregory was not the only speaker at the rally; E. Faye Williams the chair of the National Congress of Black Women opened her remarks to the crowd by saying “We stand with our queen sister Sybrina Fulton.”Williams then began advocating the crowd to take action through various tactics against those who support Stand Your Ground laws. “So we say to you my brothers and sisters don’t feel like somebody else has to do it” she said. “Everybody can do something.”“If you haven’t registered to vote yet you can register to vote” she said. “If you haven’t helped somebody else register to vote you can help them register to vote. If you haven’t given a dime to the Trayvon Martin foundation so we can carry on this work give a dime give your time or give something.”Williams said Stand Your Ground laws “are disproportionately unfair to young black men.”“We have to be there [where states are implementing these laws]” she said. “We have to keep on pulling our money back. I did it. When I heard about Stand Your Ground and how the American Legislative Exchange Council is going around the country getting states to enact Stand Your Ground laws. I pulled my money out of Bank of America. I pulled my money out of State Farm insurance.”',\n",

       " 'Fox News reporters Greg Jarrett and Ed Henry speak truth* to power: by three African American teenagersThe issue exposed by Jarrett and Henry? The fact that President Obama has not made any public statements on the murder of college baseball player Christopher Lane who was white. (See my update below: The teenagers who murdered Lane weren\\'t all African American.)Why do they think this is notable? Because Obama did offer public comments after Trayvon Martin was killed and after (in Jarrett\\'s words) \"the black Harvard professor\" got arrested inside his home (Jarrett might not know it but that professor—Henry Louis Gates—has a name).In the Jarrett-Henry world this is is hypocrisy and it proves that President Obama is a virulent anti-white racist who secretly supports the random murder of white people—as long as the murders are committed by non-whites. Never mind the fact that Obama\\'s mother was white or that his comments on Gates and Jarrett came in response to questions from reporters. Clearly Paul LePage was right: Obama hates white people.Of course Gates and Jarrett completely ignore the fact that when Trayvon Martin was killed George Zimmerman—the admitted killer—wasn\\'t arrested until weeks after the murder. Lane\\'s murderers were arrested within 24 hours. That\\'s exactly as should be. His murder was awful and nothing can change that. But the justice system is working. Without the outrage following Martin\\'s murder Zimmerman never would have had to defend himself in a court of law.Jarrett and Henry aren\\'t alone; Fox has spent much of they day posing various forms of the \"where\\'s the outrage question\" and much of the rest of the conservative media is joining in as well. But these guys don\\'t care about Christopher Lane or really even about what President Obama did or didn\\'t say. As James David Dickson writes in the Detroit News:The “where’s the outrage?” argument comes in another form: Why don’t black people protest black-on-black violence? What about all those dead kids in Chicago and Detroit? Where’s the march for them? This is an argument steeped in ignorance. If the people who make it spent even a minute researching they’d see their premise was faulty. The reason they don’t know that people do care and do march to stop black-on-black violence is because they don’t care about black-on-black violence. They’re trying to use dead black kids in Chicago to stop you from caring about a dead black kid in Florida when in reality they care about neither.That\\'s exactly right. Ultimately this outrage is manufactured to make the Fox audience feel good about themselves when they turn their heads to injustice. It\\'s about making sure they don\\'t forget that they are the real victims here because who knows what terrible things might happen to the Republican Party if one day Fox viewers woke up and lost that chip on their shoulder.*Well not so much truth as stupid and dishonest race-baiting propaganda.Wow it turns out that Fox was even worse than I thought—and that I stupidly fell for part of it. It turns out that the one of the three individuals who murdered Lane was white. So (a) my initial post got that fact wrong for which I apologize and (b) Fox is even loopier than I originally stated.Sign our petition demanding that Fox News correct their factual mistake and cease the despicable race-baiting that has resulted.',\n",
       " '8 years ago(CNN) - Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Tuesday her prayers are with Trayvon Martin\\'s family and \"every family who loves someone who is lost to violence.\"Addressing the Delta Sigma Theta sorority convention in Washington Clinton told the crowd \"No mother no father should ever have to fear for their child walking down a street in the United States of America.\"Clinton who\\'s widely considered a potential 2016 presidential contender addressed the largely-African American audience just days after a Florida jury acquitted George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Martin 17.The jury\\'s decision sparked protests across the country while many groups including the NAACP ramped up pressure on the Justice Department to press federal civil rights charges against Zimmerman.At the top of her speech Tuesday Clinton briefly addressed Martin\\'s death and the recent trial - a story that has loomed large over the convention.\"In a week that I know has brought heartache - deep painful heartache to many across our country - the solidarity and the solace you find here is all the more important\" she said.Attorney General Eric Holder addressed the same convention on Monday calling Martin\\'s death a \"tragic unnecessary shooting\" and vowing that the Justice Department with \"follow the facts of the law\" as it continues to investigate the incident.For her part Clinton encouraged the sorority the nation\\'s single largest African-American women\\'s organization to \"move forward.\"\"As we move forward as we must I hope this sisterhood will continue to be a force for justice and understanding\" she said.Tuesday\\'s appearance marked the latest in Clinton\\'s busy speech circuit. Since retiring as secretary of state at the beginning of 2013 the former first lady and U.S. senator from New York has made numerous paid and non-paid speeches across the country fueling further speculation that she\\'s gearing up for a presidential bid.She also addressed the Supreme Court\\'s recent decision that effectively ruled key parts of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 as invalid. The high court left it up to a divided Congress to revise the law so that it\\'s constitutional in the minds of a majority of justices.While many Republicans praised the decision - saying it allowed some states to navigate more freely around outdated rules - many Democrats and civil rights leaders argue the ruling threatens voting rights for minorities in states with a history of discrimination.Clinton urged the sorority women to pressure Congress to rewrite the law so that those key parts are deemed constitutional.\"I want to make sure that in the next election and the next election and the next and every one after that people line up to vote and they vote regardless of those who may not want to count their vote or acknowledge their right to vote\" she said drawing heavy applause.- CNN\\'s Ashley Killough and Steve Brusk contributed to this report.',\n",
       " 'SACRAMENTO — Enforce the laws already on the books. Take away the criminals’ weapons not the law-abiding citizens’. Sound familiar? It’s the mantra of the gun lobby.That is until the government actually attempts to do it. Then the lobby changes its lyrics.AdvertisementIt seemed surreal listening to lobbyists for gun rights groups Monday as if the ears were playing tricks. They testified at a state Senate Budget Committee hearing in opposition to legislation that would spend $24 million in surplus money to confiscate guns possessed by people who legally aren’t supposed to have them.They weren’t opposed to the gun seizure they said—only to the use of this particular money. It would come from the $19 fee each gun buyer pays for a background check to determine whether he’s legally eligible to possess a weapon. Is he a felon? Mentally ill?AdvertisementThe lobbyists contended the fee is too high and should be lowered. Never mind that the gun buyer already probably is spending several hundred dollars to buy the weapon. And bullets—depending on the caliber—may go for around say $1 each.They also argued the money should be used to speed up the background check and reduce the 10-day waiting period for taking possession of a gun. In other words it’s more important to rush a weapon into the hands of a purchaser than to grab one from the clutches of a violent criminal.Advertisement“They’re trapped and lost in their own world and it’s not the real world” says Sen. Mark Leno (D-San Francisco) coauthor of the bill SB 140 and chairman of the budget committee.Let’s back up.AdvertisementCalifornia has a unique program—the only one in the nation—that tracks known handgun and assault weapons owners to make sure they’re still legally permitted to possess a firearm. Starting next year they’ll also be doing it with buyers of all long guns.Although the gun owner originally was a legal purchaser he may have since been convicted of a violent misdemeanor or been subject to a restraining order or been diagnosed with a mental illness. A little computer cross-checking produces a red flag. And a squad of armed officers can knock on the door and seize the arsenal. Roughly 11000 weapons have been grabbed over the past six years.AdvertisementBut a few weeks ago it was revealed by the state Department of Justice that roughly 19700 Californians still illegally owned around 39000 firearms and there wasn’t enough money to confiscate them.So Leno and Senate leader Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento) introduced the bill appropriating the money on an urgency basis which means it will require a two-thirds majority vote in each house.AdvertisementAt the committee hearing the Justice Department reported that the list of “prohibited” gun owners as of March 1 had risen to an even 20000 people possessing 40790 firearms.“We know 40000 guns are in the hands of people who shouldn’t have them” Steinberg told the committee. “We know their addresses we know who they are….Advertisement“We’re not unmindful that money is precious. But here is $24 million. Go get those guns as fast as you can….This is about the notion that you do whatever you can with what you have.”A no-brainer you’d think. But not for the gun lobby.AdvertisementAlthough the number of prohibited persons possessing weapons is “inexcusable” said Kathryn Lynch representing the National Shooting Sports Foundation and the California Assn. of Firearms Retailers it is “inappropriate” to use background-check money to seize the guns.“I would argue” she continued “that this is tantamount to an attack on honest citizens.”AdvertisementNational Rifle Assn. lobbyist Ed Worley contended that the $19 fee is too high.Tom Pedersen of the California Rifle and Pistol Assn. said the surplus money should be spent on upgrading the system to accelerate the checks.AdvertisementSam Peredes lobbyist for Gun Owners of California said that using money from “law abiding gun purchasers” to seize the guns of bad guys “is not fair and reasonable and we believe places an undue burden on those people who are exercising their 2nd Amendment rights.”He contended the weapons confiscation should be paid for out of the state’s general fund.AdvertisementGuess that also means hunting-license revenue shouldn’t be used to hire game wardens to track down poachers who despoil everyone’s wildlife.Peredes lamented that the committee had blown a “historic opportunity to have both the anti-gun and the pro-gun side come together.”AdvertisementAnd in that sentence he verbalized the gun lobby’s isolation from mainstream America. It’s blinded by an uncompromising view that either people are “anti-gun” or “pro-gun” denying the reality that someone can support gun ownership while still seeking common-sense solutions to gun violence.A Field Poll recently found that 61% of California voters believe it’s more important to impose stiffer gun controls than to protect gun rights.AdvertisementThe committee ignored the gun lobby and voted for the bill 14-0 — with both Republicans and Democrats on board. Leno says he’ll take it up soon on the Senate floor.A Republican co-author Sen. Anthony Cannella of Ceres told me “It’s a great bill. It seems a great use of the fees. It just makes common sense.”AdvertisementAs for the gun lobby opposition Cannella said: “I don’t understand it. They always say ‘Take guns out of the hands of the people who shouldn’t have them.’ ”No longer. They’ve reloaded with a new refrain.Advertisementgeorge.skelton@latimes.com',\n",
       " 'Even before President Obama announced his proposed gun control measures right-wing paranoids and Republican members of Congress were raving about impeachment incipient monarchy and civil war.Obama’s proposal is expected to include a call for banning military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines as well as strengthening the background check system for gun buyers. While Congress would have to approve those major steps he may also lay out 19 actions he can take by executive order such as mandating that federal agencies gather data on gun safety.In the wake of the schoolroom massacre in Newtown Conn. and many other brutal gun-related tragedies in recent months ideas for dealing with school safety and mental illness are also said to be on Obama’s list. But most of the attention will be directed at his gun control plan and much of it will be hotheaded and shrill.The usual gun rights lunatics are preemptively saying it may be necessary to take up arms to stop the government from confiscating everyone’s guns. Rabid rocker Ted Nugent has declared Obama’s proposals “psychotic” and said putting Vice President Joe Biden and Atty. Gen. Eric Holder in charge of the task force to come up with gun legislation is comparable to “hiring Jeffrey Dahmer to tell us how to take care of our children.”AdvertisementAlthough assault weapons have been banned in the past without a loss of liberty and no regulation Obama is considering comes close to negating the right to keep and bear arms one congressman from Texas said he would push impeachment of the president for trying to nullify the 2nd Amendment.Tea party hero Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky equated Obama’s proposed administrative actions with the monarchy of King George III and pledged to fight the president “tooth and nail” as if 2013 were 1776.Clearly the debate about guns is not going to be a reasoned discussion about how to better regulate the hundreds of millions of guns in America and keep them out of the hands of criminals and crazy people. At least on the right it will be an exercise in paranoia and fear-mongering.Meanwhile in the sane state of New York Republican and Democratic legislators have joined together to pass new gun restrictions that will ban high-capacity magazines strictly limit ownership of assault weapons and ban their sale online. They did it quickly in a bipartisan fashion and Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed the measure into law on Tuesday. So far the Empire State shows no sign of turning into a Stalinist nightmare. Other than the significant exceptions of Illinois and Michigan gun deaths are generally lower in states such as California that have strict guns laws. New York was on that list even before this newest law was passed.AdvertisementOf the annual 30000 gun deaths in the U.S. only 200 are homicides resulting from acts of self-defense according to the FBI. Still no one is talking about stripping away the right of anyone to own a gun to scare off a prowler or hold off a rapist (even though most people shot by guns in homes are relatives and friends). The only types of gun anyone is talking about restricting are the assault rifles that former Gens. Colin Powell and Stanley McChrystal say should only be in the hands of soldiers -- the kind of weapon used by a mentally unstable young man to murder first-graders in Newtown.But folks on the right disagree with the generals. Apparently that is the kind of weapon they think they may desperately need in the event of civil war against the would-be monarch in the White House.',\n",
       " 'Story highlights CNN Opinion podcast features \"Big Three\" issues three commentators Dean Obeidallah: Get rid of the label \"gun control\" laws; they are really \"human safety\" laws Margaret Hoover defended Margaret Thatcher from views that she favored the rich John Avlon: It\\'s almost impossible to talk about race in America without being attackedEditor’s Note: Dean Obeidallah a former attorney is a political comedian and frequent commentator on various TV networks including CNN. He is the editor of the politics blog The Dean’s Report and co-host of a new CNN podcast “The Big Three” that looks at the top three stories of the week. Follow him on Twitter @deanofcomedy.(CNN) —“I don’t consider criminal background checks to be gun control.”Republican U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey made this profound statement earlier this week while announcing a bipartisan Senate agreement to expand background checks to almost all gun purchasers.Toomey is absolutely correct. Background checks are not about gun control they’re about human safety. Having checks will make it more difficult for criminals and the insane to obtain guns.Yet despite polls showing that over 90% of Americans support universal background checks it took a “breakthrough” deal to get this proposal simply to a vote by the U.S. Senate. What’s worse there’s no guarantee this legislation will pass the Republican-controlled House.Congress’ exasperating struggle to enact a law supported by most Americans is topic No. 1 of this week’s episode of the CNN podcast “The Big Three” co-hosted by CNN Opinion contributors Margaret Hoover John Avlon and myself. Each week we look at three big issues from the week.The second big issue is the death of Great Britain’s former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Is the fawning over her justified or did her failings outweigh her accomplishments?And third is the new song by country singer Brad Paisley and rapper LL Cool J titled “The Accidental Racist” racially insensitive or in today’s hypersensitive climate is it simply impossible to discuss race without causing an outcry?To listen to this episode of “The Big Three” click on the Soundcloud audio player on this page. Or you can find us on iTunes.Here’s a brief summary of this week’s episode:1. Gun safety lawsNewsweek/Barry Morgenstein/Dean ObeidallahJohn Avlon discussed the cowardice of the Republican senators who threatened a filibuster to prevent a vote on the proposed universal background check law a point he also raised in his most recent column. Margaret Hoover – a reasonable voice on the right (almost an oxymoron) – agreed that Republican senators like Ted Cruz could cause the entire GOP to appear as extremists if they prevented a vote on this proposal via filibuster. I made the case that we need to stop calling these measures “gun control” laws and instead label them as “human safety” laws because the focus is on saving lives not grabbing guns.I also raised the point: Is the second amendment out of date? It was enacted when we had 13 states a population of 4 million and muskets. Should we consider revising or repealing the second amendment to bring it up to date with today’s world so that owning guns is a privilege rather than a right?2. Death of Margaret ThatcherMargaret Hoover a big Thatcher fan shared the thrill of meeting the former prime minister years ago. I refused to speak ill of the recently deceased Thatcher. So instead I read excerpts from a recent op-ed penned by British comedian Russell Brand (we all know comedians tend to write the best opinion pieces). Brand was highly critical of Thatcher’s reign. John and Margaret both defended Thatcher from Brand’s allegations that she was an uncaring person who favored the wealthy at the expense of the working class.Get our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion\\'s new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook3. ‘The Accidental Racist’Paisley and LL Cool J recorded a song in the hopes of easing racial tension and fostering more understanding. Instead their song was met by almost universal criticism. Some said the lyrics are culturally insensitive others said it’s just bad. All three of us agreed that some of the lyrics were ridiculous such as LL Cool J’s line: “If you don’t judge my gold chains/I’ll forget the iron chains.” Was LL really saying that if a White man doesn’t judge his choice of flashy jewelry then Black Americans should forget slavery? But the bigger point we discussed is that it’s almost impossible to talk about race in America without being attacked by people on both the far left and far right. I also tell a joke about “White people” that I had performed last month on a TV show that generated an avalanche of angry tweets and e-mails. Just shows we’ve gone a long way to go.We hope you will give a listen to this episode of “The Big Three” – and let us know what you think about the issues we discussed.Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.',\n",

       " 'Influential figures on both sides of the gun control debate tangled Wednesday over the effectiveness of background checks with the husband of wounded former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords urging an overhaul and a top National Rifle Association official saying \"homicidal maniacs\" will skirt the system no matter what.NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre was the final witness to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee as the panel begins to consider new legislation. He argued that more security and more enforcement but not new laws is the answer to gun violence.He specifically knocked down a call by President Obama and others for \"universal\" background checks particularly at gun shows.\"When it comes to background checks let\\'s be honest -- background checks will never be universal because criminals will never submit to them\" LaPierre said.But Giffords\\' husband Mark Kelly argued that improving the background check system should be a priority. He said holes in the law \"make a mockery\" of the system -- echoing Obama\\'s recent proposal he called for submitting private sales to background checks as well. He further argued that stronger background checks could have prevented the mass shooting in January 2011 where his wife was shot in the head.LaPierre later got into an argument over the issue with Sen. Dick Durbin D-Ill. after LaPierre argued that more background checks would merely subject \"law-abiding people\" to more taxes and fees and hassle without going after \"bad guys.\"\"Mr. LaPierre that\\'s the point\" Durbin said. \"The criminals won\\'t get to purchase the guns because there\\'ll be a background check. We\\'ll stop them from the original purchase -- you missed that point completely. I think it\\'s basic.\"Raising his voice LaPierre said: \"Senator I think you missed the point!\" Chairman Patrick Leahy D-Vt. then banged the gavel and called for order.The disagreement was one of several sticking points as the Senate Judiciary Committee held the first gun control hearing since Obama released a comprehensive gun control plan earlier this month.LaPierre pressed for enforcing existing laws over creating new ones. \"Prosecuting criminals who misuse firearms works\" LaPierre testified. \"Unfortunately we\\'ve seen a dramatic collapse in federal gun prosecutions in recent years.\"He continued: \"Proposing more gun control laws while failing to enforce the thousands we already have -- it\\'s not a serious solution for reducing crime.\"The panel was stacked with high-profile witnesses on both sides of the debate. Giffords who was shot while meeting with constituents outside an Arizona supermarket in January 2011 made a surprise appearance at the start of the hearing Wednesday morning to urge Congress to act.\"We must do something\" Giffords said speaking slowly but clearly. \"It will be hard but the time is now. ... You must act.\"Giffords urged lawmakers to \"be bold be courageous.\" She later met with President Obama at the White House.\"Violence is a big problem. Too many children are dying\" the former congresswoman said. Six people were killed and 12 were wounded in the Arizona attack. The fatal shooting at an elementary school in Newtown Conn. last month brought the issue of gun control back to the fore of the congressional agenda.Kelly speaking after his wife called for a \"careful and civil conversation\" about limitations on firearms. He noted that he and Giffords own guns but are \"anti-gun violence.\"He said a \"matrix\" of failures contributes to the country\\'s gun violence problem including mental illness and poverty but also gun laws. He said the complexity is \"not an excuse for inaction.\" Kelly said weapons designed to inflict maximum damage have turned corners of America \"into places of carnage and gross human loss.\"Kelly briefly described how the 2011 shooting affected his family leaving his wife partially blind and struggling to walk. Kelly and Giffords have formed a political action committee called Americans for Responsible Solutions to back lawmakers who support tighter gun restrictions and counter the influence of the NRA.LaPierre though argued that prosecution for federal weapons violations in 2011 was essentially down 35 percent compared to previous administrations which he says means violent felons gang members and the mentally ill who possess firearms are not being prosecuted.\"That is completely and totally unacceptable\" said LaPierre who suggested fixing the country\\'s \"broken\" mental-health system become part of the solution to gun violence -- including making patient records part of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.The hearing titled \"What Should America Do about Gun Violence\" takes place roughly seven weeks after a lone gunman with psychological problems used an assault weapon to kill 20 first-graders and six adults inside a Connecticut elementary school prompting renewed calls for more gun control.The NRA with 4.5 million active members remains the most powerful gun-rights advocacy group in the country.Obama is calling for a renewed ban on semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines along with more extensive background checks.LaPierre said the group is willing to work with Congress and the president in curbing gun violence but \"law-abiding gun owners will not accept blame for the acts of violent or deranged criminals. Nor do we believe the government should dictate what we can lawfully own and use to protect our families.\"Under questioning from Sen. Chuck Schumer D-N.Y. Baltimore County Police Chief James Johnson said Wednesday that the current background check system has already stopped nearly 2 million \"prohibited purchases\" between 1994 and 2009.Sen. Dianne Feinstein D-Calif. has already introduced legislation taking similar steps to Obama\\'s proposals.The California Democrat on Tuesday said she will hold her own hearing on gun control because she was unhappy that three of the five witnesses testifying Wednesday are \"skewed against us.\" Feinstein is a member of the Judiciary Committee.Despite the momentum gun control advocates have gained since the massacre in Newtown Conn it will be difficult for them to prevail in Congress this year because of the popularity of guns in many states -- including several represented by Democratic senators -- and the formidable muscle of the NRA on Capitol Hill lawmakers and others say.Among other obstacles the Republican-run House has shown little immediate interest in making dramatic changes in the laws.At the Senate hearing Leahy D-Vt. said lawmakers were not trying to take away Americans\\' guns.\"They\\'re not at risk. ... what is at risk are lives\" he said.The committee\\'s top Republican Sen. Charles Grassley said he welcomed the \"renewed discussion\" on gun violence.But he voiced skepticism about a renewed ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. \"Those can be circumvented by carrying multiple guns\" Grassley said.The Associated Press contributed to this report.',\n",
       " 'Apparently no government is too small to get between you your doctor and your health insurer.A controversial initiative that would require women to buy an additional rider on their health insurance if they wanted abortion coverage is one short step away from going to the Legislature where it is likely to easily become law. Because no one filed a challenge by Monday’s deadline to the more than 315000 signatures turned in to the Secretary of State an initiative that would prohibit abortion coverage from being included in standard insurance policies will go forward. And the Secretary of State certified Monday that Michigan Right to Life which spearheaded the petition drive has more than enough valid signatures to start the ball rolling on the new state law. A minimum of 258088 valid signatures were needed. The anti-abortion activists turned in 315477 signatures. And the Secretary of State’s elections division estimated that 299941 of the signatures are valid. The state Board of Canvassers will meet at 9:30 a.m. Dec. 2 to certify the signatures and then the petition moves to the state Legislature which has 40 days to approve reject or do nothing with the legislative ballot initiative.If Republicans vote it down or fail to act on it it will be a ballot iniatitive in the next general election. Neither of these is likely given their ideologically extreme views. If they pass it it becomes law. The other 95.8% of us won’t have a say and neither will Governor Snyder.Oh and by the way most Michigan voters actually oppose the law.Don\\'t tell me there isn\\'t a War on Women in Michigan being waged by religious conservatives in our state.

       " '“Young adults are one diagnosis one motorcycle accident one car accident away from a lifetime of [medical] bills” Sebelius said. Health insurance obtained through the Affordable Care Act could “save them and their families from bankruptcy.”Sure millennials are often the healthiest members of the population and they may believe they’re invincible. It’s estimated as many as 16 million don’t have adequate insurance. But a broken bone or a middle-of-the-night appendicitis attack can wreck a 20-something’s financial future.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementWe know: My college-student daughter’s minor surgery done as an outpatient in April would have cost $30000 if she hadn’t been covered on my husband’s insurance (an early perk of the Affordable Care Act has allowed 2.5 million adult children up to age 26 who otherwise wouldn’t have insurance to remain on their parents’ policies). Even with the policy the bills have amounted to nearly $3000 for out-of-pocket expenses.Yet an activist group called Generation Opportunity with funding ties to the conservative Koch Brothers claims on its Web site that “there are better cheaper options” than the Affordable Care Act for fellow millennials. The group fails to list what those choices might be.The Virginia-based group which is responsible for the Uncle Sam videos has announced a $750000 effort to persuade young adults “to opt out” of using the soon-to-be-available health exchanges or health insurance marketplace to buy policies from private companies. As part of that campaign the group will take its show on the road to some 20 college campuses across the country.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“We want young people to know they have options — including the ability to opt out of Obamacare by paying a relatively small penalty” Evan Feinberg president of Generation Opportunity said in a news release. That penalty will be $95 or 1 percent of income in 2014; it will gradually increase.Feinberg refers to Obamacare as a “quite frankly creepy pyramid scheme” and explains that his group is “relying on creativity and grassroots activism” to fight it.I guess you could call the Uncle Sam ads which were posted on YouTube Thursday and have since gone viral as “creative.”In one ad Uncle Sam pops up at the foot of an exam table while a young woman has her legs in the stirrups (a vulnerable position believe me). She screams and on the screen flash the words “Don’t let government play doctor.” Then we’re treated to a close-up of Uncle Sam brandishing a speculum.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIn the other video it’s the young man’s turn looking worried (a lot of jaw-clenching going on) as he lies on his side knees to his chest his backside exposed. Uncle Sam magically appears snaps on a pair of blue rubber gloves and wriggles his fingers in anticipation.Irony anyone? Hasn’t it been members of the Republican Party playing doctor by passing legislation in a number of states requiring any woman considering an abortion to undergo an ultrasound with a transvaginal probe — a most invasive and uncomfortable procedure?The plan is simple for Generation Opportunity. They hope to undermine Obamacare by underfunding the program. The White House has estimated that at least 2.7 million of the 7 million people expected to sign up for health insurance through the health exchanges need to be young adults. If enough healthy young adults fail to buy private insurance through the health exchanges the companies will lack the funds to pay out claims for older and often sicker customers.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBut will it be that easy to win over the hearts and minds — and wallets — of the millennials? More than 27 percent of adults age 18 to 24 have no health insurance. But the idea that most of them believe they don’t need it may be just another myth like so much of the misinformation on the Affordable Care Act.Only a fourth of them think they’re healthy enough that they don’t need health insurance according to research by the Kaiser Foundation while a study by the Commonwealth Fund found that the majority of adults age 30 and under would buy insurance if they could afford it.Because of Obamacare preexisting conditions will no longer prevent some young adults from purchasing a policy. “In the past a teenage girl could take Accutane for acne and then be denied health insurance for a preexisting condition” Sebelius said.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementOr as she explained earlier during the “Mental Health Matters” conference to enthusiastic applause “Being a woman is no longer considered a preexisting condition.”I can’t help but compare health insurance and auto insurance. We’re required in many states to show proof of car insurance before we can get a license for the vehicle. And most of us would never dream of buying a nice car — but then refusing to get insurance.',\n",

The quickly rammed through bills were signed in secret by Scott Walker who wanted to avoid the publicity that dogged Republicans in Virginia and caused the Governor of that state to be renamed \"Governor Ultrasound\".They\\'re not done exerting more control over womens bodies and one State Senator is promising \"all out hell\" if they proceed.A Democratic state senator promised \"all out hell\" next week if Republicans stick to their plan to take up a controversial bill restricting abortion for public workers and limiting access to contraception for employees of religious organizations. Sen. Jon Erpenbach (D-Middleton) said Tuesday\\'s session could mirror one in June when Senate President Mike Ellis (R-Neenah) broke the base of his gavel as he slammed it down to quiet Democrats upset over passing a different abortion bill. Footage of those raucous proceedings was featured in an ad targeting Ellis run by Planned Parenthood Advocates of Wisconsin. Republicans who run the Senate are tentatively planning to approve two abortion bills on Tuesday. One would ban any abortions that are sought because of the sex of the fetus. The other would prevent public employees\\' health plans from covering most abortions and would also strictly limit the ability of employees of religious organizations to get contraception through their insurance plans.That\\'s right. If you\\'re a public employee you won\\'t be able to get an abortion and if you work for a religious organization (like a hospital) no birth control for you.In case you\\'ve forgotten this is how Republicans rammed through these bills in June with only 1 speaker and no debate:Yes Mike Ellis broke his gavel telling Democrats to sit down and shut up.

       " 'In 1970 Washington became the first -- and remains the only -- state in the country to legalize elective abortions by a popular vote.A generation later and 40 years removed from the landmark United States Supreme Court Roe v. Wade ruling that extended abortion access nationwide Washington is once again poised to stand out.With 21 states having adopted bans or severe restrictions on insurance companies from paying for abortions Washington is alone in seriously considering legislation mandating the opposite.The Reproductive Parity Act as supporters call it would require insurers in Washington state who cover maternity care -- which all insurers must do -- to also pay for abortions.The bill passed the state House earlier this month by a vote of 53-43 though it faces an uncertain future in the Senate. A similar bill in the New York state Assembly has been introduced each session for over a decade but has never received a public hearing.\"This is a core value for Washingtonians\" said Melanie Smith a lobbyist for NARAL Pro-Choice Washington. \"We should protect it while we still have it and not leave access to basic health care up to an insurance company.\"The proximate cause of Washington state\\'s measure is the federal Affordable Care Act. Thanks to language placed in it to assuage anti-abortion congressional Democrats insurers selling their plans on the state exchanges taking effect next year will have to segregate the premiums they collect for abortion coverage.In addition to that built-in disincentive to insuring abortion the law also invites states to enact stricter rules of their own. Thus far 16 states have followed suit barring or restricting insurance companies on their exchanges from covering the procedure. Three of those states are joining the five that have barred or limited all insurers from covering abortions since the early 1980\\'s.Supporters of Washington state\\'s proposed abortion insurance mandate are careful to stress that it wouldn\\'t lead to a dramatic uptick in abortions or require carriers with a religious bent to cover the procedure. They also note that a pair of federal plans that will be sold on all 50 state exchanges will be barred from covering elective abortions.\"It\\'s not expanding abortion coverage\" said Democratic Rep. Eileen Cody of West Seattle the bill\\'s primary sponsor. \"It\\'s ensuring the rights of women to get what they\\'re paying for now and to continue their freedom of choice.\"Opponents counter that the measure would require businesses and individuals to pay for abortion coverage they\\'d rather not have.\"Washington state would be the only state in the country that would force employers to pay for abortion\" said Peggy O\\'Ban spokeswoman for Human Life of Washington.If passed she said it would amount to \"the first conscience coercion act in American history.\"Its passage however is not assured.Proponents of the measure say they have the votes they need in the state Senate but it\\'s not clear that Senate leaders will allow it to get to the floor. It is scheduled to receive a public hearing in the Senate Health Care Committee on April 1.Ironically the man bill supporters will likely blame if it fails to get a Senate vote counts himself as a proud backer of the measure.Sen. Rodney Tom of Medina a fiscal conservative and social moderate and one other like-minded Democrat crossed party lines to caucus with Republicans in December handing a one-vote majority to the GOP. Seizing power for the first time in nearly a decade elated Senate Republicans reciprocated by installing Tom as Majority Leader.Last month Tom addressed about 250 advocates rallying for the measure\\'s passage on the state Capitol steps.\"I\\'m down here making sure that my 17-year-old daughter has the kind of protections that we need in Washington state and that all of our kids have those same kinds of protections\" Tom said to cheers.Moments later Gov. Jay Inslee a Democrat and fellow bill supporter delivered a not-so-subtle challenge to Tom\\'s political will.Washington state \"deserves a vote in the state Senate on the Reproductive Parity Act\" Inslee said. \"We are going to insist that we are not going to let anybody close the door to democracy in this state.\"Another irony: though the bill has proved to be among the most hotly contested of the session its broader impact if passed may be less than sweeping.For one thing most abortions are paid for out-of-pocket. According to the Guttmacher Institute only 12 percent of abortions nationwide are paid for by private insurers with 20 percent footed by Medicaid.For another because most abortions cost less than a live birth -- the procedure typically runs about $500 though late-term abortions are far more expensive -- insurers may be disinclined to stop covering them.At present all major insurers in Washington state cover abortions and Cody the bill\\'s sponsor said she knows of no carrier with plans to change. Insurers new to Washington state on its exchange may be tempted to adopt different policies she said.No matter its immediate impact said Elizabeth Nash states issues manager with the Guttmacher Institute the bill\\'s passage would be a watershed event.\"It would be a model for other states to follow\" she said.',\n",
       " 'AUSTIN Texas (AP) — The Texas Senate passed sweeping new abortion restrictions late Friday sending them to Republican Gov. Rick Perry to sign into law after weeks of protests and rallies that drew thousands of people to the Capitol and made the state the focus of the national abortion debate.Republicans used their large majority in the Texas Legislature to pass the bill nearly three weeks after a filibuster by Democratic Sen. Wendy Davis and an outburst by abortion-rights activists in the Senate gallery disrupted a deadline vote June 25.Called back for a new special session by Perry lawmakers took up the bill again as thousands of supporters and opponents held rallies and jammed the Capitol to testify at public hearings. As the Senate took its final vote protesters in the hallway outside the chamber chanted \"Shame! Shame! Shame!\"Democrats have called the GOP proposal unnecessary and unconstitutional. Republicans said the measure was about protecting women and unborn children.House Bill 2 would require doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals allow abortions only in surgical centers limit where and when women may take abortion-inducing pills and ban abortions after 20 weeks.Abortion-rights supporters say the bill will close all but five abortion clinics in Texas leaving large areas of the vast state without abortion services. Only five out of 42 existing abortion clinics meet the requirements to be a surgical center and clinic owners say they can\\'t afford to upgrade or relocate.The circus-like atmosphere in the Texas Capitol marked the culmination of weeks of protests the most dramatic of which came June 25 in the final minutes of the last special legislative session Davis\\' filibuster and subsequent protest prevented the bill from becoming law.The Senate\\'s debate took place between a packed gallery of demonstrators with anti-abortion activists wearing blue and abortion-rights supporters wearing orange. Security was tight and state troopers reported confiscating bottles of urine and feces as they worked to prevent another attempt to stop the Republican majority from passing the proposal.Story continuesThose arrested or removed from the chamber included four women who tried to chain themselves to a railing in the gallery. One of the women was successful in chaining herself prompting a 10-minute recess.When debate resumed protesters began loudly singing \"Give choice a chance. All we are saying is give choice a chance.\" The Senate\\'s leader Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst told officers to remove them.Sen. Glen Hegar of Katy the bill\\'s Republican author argued that all abortions including those induced with medications should take place in an ambulatory surgical center in case of complications.Democrats pointed out that childbirth is more dangerous than an abortion and there have been no serious problems with women taking abortion drugs at home. They introduced amendments to add exceptions for cases of rape and incest and to remove some of the more restrictive clauses but Republicans dismissed all of the proposed changes.Sen. Royce West a Dallas Democrat asked why Hegar was pushing restrictions that federal courts in other states had suspended as possibly unconstitutional.\"There will be a lawsuit. I promise you\" West said raising his right hand as if taking an oath.The bill mirrors restrictions passed in Mississippi Ohio Oklahoma Alabama Kansas Wisconsin and Arizona. In North Carolina lawmakers are considering a measure that would allow state health officials to apply standards for ambulatory surgical centers to abortion clinics.Passing the law in Texas would be a major victory for anti-abortion activists in the nation\\'s second most-populous state. A lawsuit originating in Texas would also likely win a sympathetic hearing at the conservative 5th Circuit Court of Appeals on its way to the U.S. Supreme Court.But Democrats see in the protests an opportunity that could help them break a 20-year statewide losing streak. They believe Republicans have overreached in trying to appease their base and alienated suburban women a constituency that helped President Barack Obama win re-election.\"In the long run all they have done is built a committed group of people across this state who are outraged about the treatment of women and the lengths to which this Legislature will go to take women\\'s health care away\" Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards told The Associated Press in an interview Friday.Sen. John Whitmire a Houston Democrat said during the debate that it was clear the bill was part of national conservative agenda attempting to ban abortion and infringe on women\\'s rights one state at a time. He pressed Hegar on why the Texas Medical Association Texas Hospital Association and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology opposed the bill.He asked Hegar how he could ignore these experts.\"There are differences in the medical profession\" Hegar insisted rejecting the criticism. \"I don\\'t believe this legislation will majorly impede the doctor-patient relationship.\"Sen.

Mark Obenshain (R) won the Republican nomination for attorney general this weekend Think Progress dug up a bill he introduced in 2009 that would have required a woman to report her miscarriage to the police within 24 hours of it happening or risk jail time.A spokesperson for Obenshain told HuffPost on Monday that the senator introduced the bill in response to a news story about a 20-year-old college student who allegedly disposed of her dead newborn in the trash in Rockingham County Virginia. Jared Walczak Obenshain\\'s deputy campaign manager for policy said Obenshain was trying to pass a law to enable law enforcement to prosecute a woman in that circumstance but he ended up with a bill that threatened all pregnant women with prosecution in the event that they miscarry.\"As sometimes happens the legislation that emerged was far too broad and would have had ramifications that neither he nor the Commonwealth\\'s attorney\\'s office ever intended\" Walczak said. \"Sen. Obenshain is strongly against imposing any added burden for women who suffer a miscarriage and that was never the intent of the legislation.\"Walczak said Obenshain met with representatives of Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia in an attempt to resolve the problem but he was unable to come up with a solution so he withdrew the bill.NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia confirmed that Obenshain reached out to them about the bill in 2009 and they told him they did not support it.Tarina Keene the group\\'s executive director told HuffPost \"In 2009 we made it clear to Sen. Obenshain that NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia vehemently opposed his bill to criminalize tragic pregnancy complications and intimidate grieving Virginian women with the threat of law enforcement -- not to mention jail time. Although Sen. Obenshain did reach out to us amidst public backlash for a \\'solution\\' we clearly told him we would support nothing but immediate defeat of the legislation. While I\\'m relieved that he eventually decided to pull his bill it is deeply troubling that an elected official would even consider such a callous and insulting effort.\"Obenshain joins a wave of far-right social conservatives running for office in Virginia including gubernatorial candidate and current attorney general Ken Cuccinelli and his running mate Bishop E.W.

       " 'A two-year budget bill advanced by Ohio\\'s state House of Representatives on Tuesday would defund Planned Parenthood redirect that state money to Christian-run \"crisis pregnancy centers\" and impose a fine of up to $5000 on teachers who provide certain kinds of sex education instruction to their students.The sex education amendment to the budget bill introduced by Rep. Lynn Wachtmann (R) encourages schools to teach abstinence-only education and bans sexual education that condones \"any gateway sexual activity or health message that encourages students to experiment with sexual activity.\" The amendment also prohibits teachers from distributing contraceptive materials and bans public schools from using the services of any individual or organization who “endorses student nonabstinence from sexual activity as an appropriate or acceptable behavior or if that individual or organization promotes endorses advocates or condones gateway sexual activity.”Instructors who violate the law could be sued in court for up to $5000.State Democratic Chairman Chris Redfern told the Toledo Blade that Republicans are “bent on outlawing sexuality and reverting to the Dark Ages.\"\"If this legislature focused on what really mattered we could get a lot done. Instead too many of my colleagues have this bizarre attraction to these extreme issues\" he said.Wachtmann did not immediately return HuffPost\\'s calls for comment.Another provision of the House budget bill would redirect about $1.4 million in state family planning funds from Planned Parenthood to other local health providers and crisis pregnancy centers which are Christian-owned organizations whose mission is to convince women not to have abortions. Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio provides health and family planning services to about 100000 women each year at 27 clinics across the state. If the bill passes all of the Planned Parenthood clinics would be moved to the bottom of the priority list for state funding because three of them provide abortions.All abortions provided at Planned Parenthood clinics are paid for privately by the patient because the Hyde Amendment prohibits any federal dollars from being used to fund the procedure. But Republicans have long argued that Planned Parenthood indirectly uses public grants to pay for all of its services including abortions.State Rep. Ron Maag (R-Lebanon) said at a hearing on the bill last week that if Planned Parenthood wants to receive more federal funds it should stop providing abortions at all of its clinics. “If the hang-up is abortion and you only have three clinics that are doing it and there are other places women could go why do you persist in having those clinics when it is putting your good work in jeopardy?” he asked Stephanie Kight president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio.Kight said the thousands of Ohio women who use Planned Parenthood as their primary health care provider can attest to the fact that it is not a bottom-tier provider. “It’s interesting that they would introduce a bill that would require us to be something that we’re not while we’re the most-trusted provider for women’s health care\" in the state she said.',\n",
       " 'In the public relations push for his takeover of the American health care system President Obama promised that those who like their insurance could keep it premiums would decrease and no one would lose their doctor. We know now those were all lies told repeatedly and never questioned by a media that is still looking the other way. Another promise Obama made was that ObamaCare would not fund abortions. LifeNews reports that this was also a lie:The ObamaCare statute specifically requires the issuers of Exchange plans that cover abortion to “collect from each enrollee in the plan” a “separate payment” for the type of abortions for which funding is prohibited under the Hyde Amendment (which is all abortions other than in cases of life of the mother rape or incest) and a separate payment for all other services. [42 U.S.C. 18023(b)]. These separate payments are then to be deposited into separate accounts.During the regulatory process commenters questioned HHS on how this was to be implemented and according to HHS the commenters “recommended that HHS clarify . . . whether [Exchange plan] issuers may satisfy the separate payment provision by providing each enrollee with an itemized bill and whether an enrollee’s coverage would be terminated for failure to comply with the separate payment provision.” Rather than doing so HHS merely said that the comments would be taken into consideration in any future guidance. [77 Fed. Reg. 18430 (March 27 2012)].Now despite the clear language of the ObamaCare statute it appears that the separate check requirement is not going to be enforced by the Obama Administration. Gretchen Borchelt director of state reproductive health policy at the National Women’s Law Center told the Huffington Post that “we used to talk about it as being two checks that the consumer would have to write because of the segregation requirements but that’s not the way it’s being implemented.” (Huffington Post Sept. 3 2013).Likewise a spokeswoman for Rhode Island’s Exchange told PolitiFact Rhode Island that “the customer is not billed a separate fee.” (Politifact Oct. 2 2013. The Rhode Island Exchange will handle the billing not the plan issuers). As PolitiFact notes “it turns out to be a hidden fee.”There is nothing the media is willing to make Obama pay a political price for.

Bob McDonnell (R) introduced an amendment to the state\\'s health insurance exchange implementation bill that would prevent insurance plans in the new health exchange from covering abortion.While similar bills introduced in other states would allow a woman to buy a policy rider for abortion coverage McDonnell\\'s proposed amendment late Monday night would ban that as well.\"No qualified health insurance plan that is sold or offered for sale through an exchange established or operating in the Commonwealth shall provide coverage for abortions regardless of whether such coverage is provided through the plan or is offered as a separate optional rider thereto\" the amendment reads adding that women who have become pregnant from rape or incest or whose lives are in danger would be exempt from the ban.Most private insurance plans in the U.S. include abortion coverage. NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia estimates that the ban on abortion coverage in Virginia will affect about 50000 women in Virginia -- the estimated number who will be using state-based health benefits exchange.NARAL Planned Parenthood and other reproductive rights advocacy groups condemned the amendment because it could prevent many low-income women from being able to access abortion care.“With this amendment Governor McDonnell has launched yet another effort to intrude in women’s health care decisions and block Virginians access to comprehensive reproductive health care\" said Caroline O’Shea deputy director of NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia in a statement. \"Coverage for safe legal abortion care -- a procedure one in three women will access in their lifetimes - is a basic benefit that most insurance plans currently include. By banning women from using their own funds to purchase plans that include this common benefit Gov. McDonnell is restricting Virginians’ personal economic decisions as well as their access to comprehensive care.\"McDonnell\\'s office did not respond to The Huffington Post\\'s request for comment.Anti-abortion advocacy groups and state lawmakers have been lobbying McDonnell for weeks to propose the abortion coverage amendment.

A little over an hour later the Senate voted to choke off the first filibuster hurdle on its own version of the funding bill which is the first step toward allowing Democrats to include funding for the health-care law that had previously been stripped out by the House.Both houses of Congress must reach agreement on funding legislation by Monday night to avoid most federal agencies closing on Tuesday.( Read a transcript of Cruz’s remarks on Tuesday. )Meanwhile a similarly contentious debate is simmering over raising the federal debt ceiling with Treasury Secretary Jack Lew warning Wednesday that the nation will exhaust its emergency borrowing capacity no later than Oct. 17.Despite urging from some of his colleagues not to stage the talkathon Cruz took the floor Tuesday afternoon promising to speak against the health-care law “until I am no longer able to stand.”To most Americans it looked like a traditional filibuster fixed in the popular imagination by Jimmy Stewart’s performance in “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.” But parliamentary procedures already in place meant that Cruz eventually would have to yield the floor.Cruz’s controversial strategy shrank the window available for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) and his colleagues to respond with a different version of the legislation.(INTERACTIVE: Longest filibusters of all time )By 5 a.m. the length of Cruz’s marathon discourse had surpassed lengthy filibusters by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) in March and the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) in 1964. He earned a lead spot on all three network morning news shows acknowledging that he was “a little bit” tired but still looking remarkably fresh. The television anchors dubbed Cruz’s effort a “talkathon” even as they explained to viewers that his effort would not derail the legislative process.The senator still wearing the dark suit and light blue tie he had donned the previous day kept his composure throughout his marathon presentation.The Cruz talkathon was the latest example of the increasingly stark division among Republicans both on Capitol Hill and nationally. The Texas newcomer just 42 and nine months into his first term in office is carrying the banner for conservatives who urge a take-no-prisoners approach in confronting the president even if it means shuttering the government.But the move angered senior Republicans who complained that Cruz and the other junior senators pushing this strategy did not understand the wounds the GOP suffered during the mid-1990s shutdown battles with President Bill Clinton. Back then the party controlled both the House and Senate a luxury compared with its tenuous majority in the House today.“I just don’t believe anybody benefits from shutting the government down and certainly Republicans don’t. We learned that in 1995” said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (Utah) the dean of the GOP caucus. “We’re in the minority. We have to find a way of standing up for our principles without immolating ourselves in front of everybody in a way when we don’t have the votes to do it.”Some suggested that the clashing approaches were the latest evidence of a party adrift both on policy and strategic thinking. “We haven’t had much of a strategy on anything to this point. Everybody’s shooting from the hip” said Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.).Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) originally preferred a different approach that would have required Democrats to vote for the health-care funds while GOP senators could have symbolically opposed.Cruz played a leading role along with outside conservative groups in pushing House Republicans to take a harder line. House Republicans on Friday passed a bill without funding for Obamacare exactly as Cruz wanted.McConnell had hoped that he could get Cruz and his band of allies to relent so that the Senate could pass something by Friday. He even convened an extra meeting in addition to the weekly Tuesday policy luncheon at which several senators said Cruz was urged to drop some of his delaying tactics so that Boehner could get the legislation before late Sunday or early Monday.But Cruz would not budge.“We don’t need fake fights. We don’t need fake votes. We need real change. We need a better economy. We need more jobs” Cruz said early Tuesday afternoon rejecting the original Boehner-McConnell plan.All through the night and well into the morning Cruz’s oratory touched on a broad mix of subjects and sources including lyrics from a song by country music star Toby Keith; quotations from the popular reality television show “Duck Dynasty;” recollections of how his father Rafael Cruz used to make green eggs and ham for breakfast; and a recent acceptance speech by actor Ashton Kutcher at an awards show.At one point Tuesday night Cruz opted to read bedtime stories to his two young daughters who he said were home in Texas watching television with his wife. Cruz first read King Solomon’s Wise Words from the Book of Proverbs and then the Dr. Seuss classic “Green Eggs and Ham” which he said was one of his favorite children’s books.Several times Cruz read supportive messages sent to his office via Twitter.Cruz was permitted to yield to colleagues for long-form questions but could not leave the floor or sit while his effort was under way.Several like-minded Senate conservatives took turns giving him respite Tuesday evening including Paul and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) two 2016 presidential aspirants. Rubio returned to the Senate floor Wednesday morning along with Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.).Cruz’s most frequent partner has been Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) who at times phrased “questions” that stretched for almost an hour and included detailed critiques of Supreme Court decisions and a series of recollections from his younger years all designed to draw attention to his concerns about the health-care law.The extended discourse by Cruz and Lee is the culmination of a strategy they began developing in the summer when Lee first elected in 2010 started looking for allies to defund the health-care law by using annual spending bills for federal agencies as potential leverage.Lee and Cruz launched a commercial campaign that targeted fellow Republicans with ads designed to pressure GOP senators to support the pair’s shutdown strategy. Senior colleagues have rejected the approach and instead have grown more angry.A series of junior Democratic senators presided over the Senate chamber through the night as Cruz talked on and on and on. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) passed the time scanning her iPad. Reporters spotted Sen. Chris Murphy (Conn.) returning to the U.S. Capitol shortly before 11 p.m. with a Red Bull in hand.“There’s no point to this other than advancing the career of one or two senators” Murphy said as he wrapped up his two-hour shift around 1 a.m.As dawn neared Cruz began leaning more on the podium at his desk which was surrounded by binders and stacks of paper. In case he ever lost his sense of place a large yellow Post-it note reminded him in blue ink: “Yield only for the purpose of a question. Be careful!”Rosalind Helderman and Jeff Simon contributed to this report.RELATED: 25 leading conservative voices',\n",
       " 'People gather outside the state legislature as Senate Republicans gave their final approval to legislation requiring additional rules surrounding abortions in North Carolina even as hundreds of protesters against the bill watched from the gallery in Raleigh N.C. on July 3. (Gerry Broome/AP)As a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly years ago Republican Scott Walker pushed two key measures to limit abortions. Neither was successful.But as governor on Friday Walker signed legislation requiring that women get an ultrasound before having an abortion and mandating that doctors who perform the procedure have admitting privileges at a local hospital. Opponents say the bill would force at least two clinics in Wisconsin to close.The measures are part of a wave of abortion limits passed this year by conservative lawmakers and governors who have approved more than 40 restrictions in statehouses around the country according to data from the Guttmacher Institute which tracks the issue.The push has been aided by the expanded control of state governments by Republicans who now hold a majority of governerships and legislatures and who enjoy veto-proof majorities in twice as many states as Democrats. Some of the measures were also fueled by outrage over the conduct of providers such as Philadelphia late-term abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell who was convicted of murder charges this spring.By mobilizing partisans on both sides the abortion issue is poised to figure more prominently in the 2014 and 2016 elections than most strategists would have expected six months ago.Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) widely seen as a presidential contender is weighing whether to play a leading role on the issue by sponsoring a Senate bill to ban abortions 20 weeks after fertilization. Rubio is attempting to shore up support among conservatives who opposed his role in crafting a Senate immigration bill.In North Carolina the state Senate adopted a sweeping bill Wednesday that includes a ban on sex-selective abortions and on abortion coverage in insurance offered in the state’s health exchange. It also requires abortion clinics be held to the same standards as ambulatory surgical centers and have a transfer agreement with a local hospital.In Texas the legislature convened a second special session this week to take up a bill similar to North Carolina’s which state Sen. Wendy Davis (D) successfully blocked through a filibuster in late June.“It’s not as if there’s some central mastermind strategy that’s organizing action on the state level” said Maureen Ferguson senior policy adviser at the Catholic Association. “It really is a response of the people and the growing pro-life sentiment in the country.”But abortion rights activists and their Democratic allies say the push will work to their political advantage in upcoming congressional and gubernatorial races allowing them to portray Republicans as more focused on extreme social issues than on bolstering the economy. Many of the abortion measures also face court challenges that could delay implementation for months or years.Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Rep. Steve Israel (N.Y.) said in an interview that the DCCC was already targeting 16 House Republicans who had voted in June for the 20-week abortion ban written by Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) or in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood in the last Congress.“Republicans have shown they can’t help themselves from pursuing an ideological agenda and they are further alienating independent and moderate voters” Israel said. “They are pulling themselves down on this issue.”GOP officials say they do not expect abortion to become a decisive factor in upcoming races. Republican candidates will focus instead on economic issues and on controversy surrounding President Obama’s Affordable Care Act they said.“Like most campaigns the issues that are discussed most are the issues that voters deal with on a day-to-day basis” said Brad Dayspring spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. “At the current moment that seems to be jobs the economy making sure health care is affordable and making sure our children have the opportunities we were blessed with.”Abortion is already a major campaign issue in some contests including the Virginia governor’s race between GOP Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II and former Democratic National Committee chairman Terry McAuliffe. But Cuccinelli campaign strategist Chris LaCivita said much of the focus is being driven by one side which has attacked the attorney general for his opposition to abortion even in cases of rape and incest and his push to impose new requirements on abortion clinics.“Ken Cuccinelli’s position on life is well known” LaCivita said. “But the only people trying to make it a central issue are Terry McAuliffe and the Democrats.”Some Republicans however say they are concerned that GOP lawmakers continue to mishandle the issue through clumsy statements that alienate women. During committee consideration of the House abortion bill last month Franks touched off a firestorm when he said that “the incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low.”The following week Rep. Michael C. Burgess (R-Tex.) argued that sonograms suggest a young fetus can experience sexual pleasure. “If they’re a male baby they may have a hand between their legs” Burgess said. “If they feel pleasure why can’t they feel pain?”One Republican Party official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue said the Franks bill “should have been a political win for us and it was a messaging disaster. . . . Salacious inappropriate comments coming out of male House Republicans’ mouths — it just damages the brand.”Abortion opponents who play a crucial role in the Republican base have been pushing particularly hard for legislative action amid revelations about unsafe practices at some abortion clinics. Gosnell was convicted in May of first-degree murder in the deaths of three infants and of involuntary manslaughter in the death of an adult patient. Live Action an anti-abortion group has spurred state investigations of clinics by producing dozens of videos with undercover footage.“House Republicans felt very strongly after the horrors committed by Kermit Gosnell we needed to protect life and protect women and children from these unsafe and inhumane practices” said Rory Cooper spokesman for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.). But he added “Right now we’re focused on energy and jobs.”Public opinion has remained mostly supportive of the right to legal abortion since the 1990s but many Americans are willing to impose tighter restrictions on the procedure. Under the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision abortions can be performed until the point when an individual doctor determines a fetus’s viability which is generally defined as up to 24 weeks of gestation. After that point the government can prohibit the procedure if it provides safeguards for the mother’s health and well-being.Fifty-five percent of respondents said abortion should be legal in all or most cases in an August 2012 Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation poll with 42 percent saying it should be illegal in all or most cases. A Gallup poll in December 2012 found that while 61 percent of respondents supported keeping abortions in the first trimester legal 64 percent thought second-trimester abortions should be illegal and 80 percent backed banning third-trimester abortions.The pace of state abortion restrictions in recent years has accelerated with more than 170 enacted since 2011 according to the Guttmacher Institute.Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser whose group plans to spend $1.5 million helping Cuccinelli said Republicans can win at the ballot box if they “bring the public to a point of consensus” around issues such as a 20-week ban and tougher operating standards for clinics.Democrats are doing their best to put all anti-abortion Republicans in the same camp as Todd Akin whose Senate candidacy for a seat in Missouri collapsed last year after he suggested women don’t get pregnant in instances of “legitimate rape.”Democrats pounced this week after Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) signed several new abortion restrictions into law while surrounded by a group of male legislators. Both the Democratic Governors Association and American Bridge 21st Century a liberal super PAC began highlighting the scene in political attacks.Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols called the criticism unfounded. “The governor is pro-life and we believe these are reasonable policies to help protect human life” he wrote in an e-mail.But Ilyse Hogue president of NARAL Pro-Choice America said Kasich’s move “will be an issue for him” in his reelection campaign next year. “These are going to be nationalized races in a way we haven’t seen with these state races because people understand the things that are at stake” she said.Capital Insight survey research analyst Scott Clement contributed to this report.',\n",

       " 'RICHMOND Va. (AP) — It was the kickoff of a \"Stop Amnesty Tour\" organized by the Tea Party Patriots and other groups. But the crowd was so sparse that immigrant advocates were soon gleefully circulating photos of the featured speaker Republican Rep. Steve King of Iowa standing alone on an empty stage.The rally at a public park in Richmond Va. earlier this month along with the subsequent cancellation or postponement of several similar events points to an emerging reality during Congress\\' five-week summer recess: Opposition to overhauling immigration laws appears notably muted almost tame. Meanwhile advocates who support comprehensive overhaul legislation are claiming they\\'ve changed at least a handful of minds among House Republicans.During Congress\\' last attempt to remake the immigration system in 2007 public backlash helped kill the bill as angry calls overwhelmed the Senate switchboard. This summer other issues notably President Barack Obama\\'s health care law seem to be topping the list of voters\\' concerns.Constituents opposed to citizenship for immigrants in this country illegally are loudly voicing their views at Republican House members\\' town hall meetings this month. But advocates of immigration legislation that offers a path to citizenship are having some success getting their supporters to show up too even in heavily Republican districts.\"In a sort of immediate sense Obamacare is what the party has decided they want to make a big deal of in these town halls so that\\'s frankly siphoning off a lot of outrage because the people ticked off about Obamacare are the same people ticked off about amnesty\" said Mark Krikorian executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies which opposes higher immigration levels.Plus the pro-immigration reform side is better organized and funded this time around and many establishment Republicans are on board. \"All of that put together means you\\'re not going to see the same level of frantic activity\" Krikorian said.Story continuesWhat\\'s less clear is how much it will matter once lawmakers return to Washington in September.Immigration overhaul legislation a top second-term priority for Obama is in limbo after the Democratic-led Senate in June passed a far-reaching bill that includes tens of billions of dollars for border security new visa programs to bring more high- and low-skilled workers to the country requirements for employers to check all workers\\' legal status and a 13-year path to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants already in the country illegally.GOP House leaders have rejected that approach vowing instead to proceed with bills addressing individual immigration issues beginning with border security. And although by advocates\\' count more than 20 House Republicans have now declared their support for some kind of citizenship path the majority of House Republicans remain opposed creating a potentially unbridgeable divide between the House and the Senate. Congress also faces looming deadlines on the debt ceiling and spending bills to keep the government running. It all adds up to a tough environment for getting an immigration bill to Obama\\'s desk.Nonetheless pro-immigrant advocates are claiming success in their August recess efforts to pressure House Republicans to act on immigration in the fall. An unusual and deep-pocketed alliance of Catholics and evangelicals labor unions business groups and others have been targeting dozens of GOP members viewed as open to hearing them out and say they\\'ll have momentum on their side when Congress reconvenes.\"The big story I think of the August recess is that we haven\\'t seen what some had predicted this major anti-immigrant movement where members of Congress would be heckled into inaction\" Galen Carey vice president of government relations at the National Association of Evangelicals said on a media call this week to announce a $400000 14-state radio ad campaign in support of immigration reform. \"We\\'ve seen very much that that has been a muted voice but actually the pro-immigrant voice has been rather prominent at many of the town halls that we have observed.\"Although there have been no giant public rallies to draw national attention pro-immigrant advocates have kept up a drumbeat of activity nationwide. They sent some 1500 supporters into House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy\\'s Bakersfield Calif. district last week; delivered a 10000-signature petition to Rep. Blake Farenthold R-Texas; and launched a statewide tour through Wisconsin among other activities.They\\'re pointing to comments in the past few weeks from a handful of House Republicans including Reps. Daniel Webster of Florida Aaron Schock of Illinois and Dave Reichert of Washington indicating qualified support for eventual citizenship for immigrants here illegally. So far though such comments have not become too widespread and it\\'s uncertain they\\'ll add up to a real impetus for action in the fall.But immigrant activists who\\'d been concerned that this summer could be a repeat of the last immigration fight — or of 2009 when irate voters trashed Obama\\'s health care bill at unruly town hall meetings across the country — are starting to breathe easy.The Stop Amnesty Tour event Aug. 12 in Richmond was to have been followed by events in other states several of which subsequently disappeared from the Tea Party Patriots\\' website according to an archived version circulated by the pro-immigrant group America\\'s Voice. Organizers said most were going forward or rescheduled and disputed the claim by America\\'s Voice that events were being canceled due to lack of interest.\"I think that when I heard about what happened at the Richmond event we just look at what can we do to improve going forward and one thing would be to give people more than 72 hours\\' notice\" said Jenny Beth Martin co-founder of Tea Party Patriots. The group is working on the events with others including NumbersUSA which advocates lower immigration levels.The Black American Leadership Alliance which opposes allowing more immigrants into the country to compete for jobs canceled a series of rallies according to cached copies of Facebook postings collected by America\\'s Voice. But Leah Durant the group\\'s founder said those events were being held by local groups and the Black American Leadership Alliance was just trying to help support them.\"When I look at the focus of what\\'s going on I wouldn\\'t say that there\\'s no enthusiasm\" Durant said. \"I hear from people every day who say they are very concerned about this.\"',\n",
       " 'Story highlights David Rothkopf: Kerry Clinton collaborated (accidentally?) to add hopeful twist on Syria In a \"goof\" Kerry said Syria yielding chemical weapons might avert U.S. strike Rothkopf says Potential presidential candidate Clinton called it \"important step\" and showed her influence Rothkopf: Even if plan fails it gives Obama cover for trying diplomacyEditor’s Note: David Rothkopf writes regularly for CNN.com. He is CEO and editor-at-large of the FP Group publishers of Foreign Policy magazine and a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Follow him on Twitter.(CNN) —On Monday President Barack Obama’s two secretaries of state inadvertently collaborated with Russia’s foreign minister to shape a twist in the Syria debate that a day later is looking more and more like a possible way out of the current crisis.It took an idea from being an off-the-cuff throwaway line through being an informal proposal to the point today where it will be proposed for consideration by the United Nations. Perhaps more importantly for the President it may help save him from a political showdown in Congress where it seems increasingly likely he cannot win while adding a glimmer of hope to a story that for two weeks has been an unrelenting mess for the White House and of deep concern to the American people.The first move came from the current secretary of state John Kerry. In a statement that was initially seen as a slip of the tongue (probably because it was) Kerry raised the possibility that if Syria were to give up its chemical weapons an attack might be avoided. Although the administration almost immediately backed away from the statement and the British foreign secretary characterized it as impossible the idea quickly began to gain traction.David RothkopfSyrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem announced that his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov had proposed that Syria’s chemical weapons be put under some form of international control as a way of forestalling a U.S.-led attack. Moallem went further welcoming the initiative.It turned out Kerry had spoken to Lavrov. And while Washington’s first response was natural skepticism given the misrepresentations of the Syrian government in the past it became clear that if there was any chance such an initiative could spare the president the political debacle of a failed vote in the Congress – and possibly spare the country the costs of another military intervention in the region – some in the administration felt it was worth considering.So hours after a senior official had told CNN the Kerry statement was a “major goof” the press office in the White House was claiming credit suggesting that the “credible threat” of a U.S. plan had triggered the diplomatic opening.Next up former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who had already been teed up to offer a statement of support for her former boss/potential predecessor made a brief statement that had to have been carefully cleared with the White House.She called the idea that Syria might give up its chemical weapons an “important step” if the Russians and the Syrians actively followed up on it. This was yet another sign that the administration was hoping that the morning’s seeming misstep yield an opportunity to step away from a congressional showdown or at least buy some breathing room.Further while Clinton did not address the specifics of Obama’s proposed Syria intervention she did say that she would support him.Up until now her silence on the issue was seen by some as an effort by the likely presidential candidate to distance herself from the Obama team’s muddled handling of the proposed Syria intervention. But Monday’s message not only showed her political loyalty to the president but it also emphasized the outsized influence of her views in America and around the globe.In the wake of her remarks there were initially reports that other nations such as France would welcome giving the Russian initiative a chance. The President framed it as a “potentially positive development.” Then on Tuesday the Syrian government formally accepted the Russian proposal. The U.S. and France took the plan to the United Nations to give it the formal backing and oversight of that institution. It is still clearly a long way from being realized but there is momentum.Nonetheless even should it blow up appearing to consider it allows Obama to be able to say he had exhausted all diplomatic options to resolve the problem. And for the more the hawkishly inclined it would also be seen as reminder that military pressure is often key to producing peaceful political outcomes.Either way for a moment an idea that might ultimately seem to be in the interest of Obama Russian President Vladimir Putin Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and arguably the Syrian Opposition (to the extent they no longer might face chemical weapons) gained surprising traction. This was thanks in part to the seeming misstep of America’s current top diplomat to his swift interaction with his Russian counterpart and the added weight his predecessor’s views brought to the matter.It is a long-shot proposal started perhaps by accident promoted by parties who have regularly lied and cautiously embraced by a U.S. administration whose policies in Syria have been incoherent by any measure. Regardless of whether it amounts to anything or not it speaks volumes about how bad our options are.Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Rothkopf.',\n",

That appears to be as much the case in Indonesia as it is in the United States.Daming Sanusi a candidate for the Indonesian Supreme Court has fueled outrage in the predominantly Muslim country by suggesting that rape victims enjoy being violated.Read more: ‘Mother Robin’ delivers for poor women in IndonesiaHe made the comments Monday in front of a parliamentary commission hearing to determine if he was a fit for the top court according to the official Indonesian news agency Antara.In response to a question about whether the death penalty should be applied in rape cases Daming reportedly said “Consideration needs to be taken thoroughly for the imposition of death penalty for a rapist because in a rape case both the rapist and the victim enjoy it.”News of his comments quickly spread on social media prompting anger disgust and calls for Daming’s candidature for the Supreme Court to be shot down.CNN iReport: Women of Indonesia“We ask legislators not to give the judge position to Daming as he had offended people`s feeling by uttering inappropriate statement” Ridwan Bakar a spokesman for the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation said Tuesday.As the furor grew Daming issued an apology acknowledging that his words were “out of control.”In a news conference he said that he was nervous in the session in front of the lawmakers and made the comment as a joke.“I made the remark without realizing it can harm people’s feeling” Antara cited him as saying.Damage is doneBut his contrition appeared to be too little too late.“The damage has been done” Primastuti Handayani the managing editor of the Jakarta Post wrote in a commentary published Wednesday. “Nothing he said in his apology can heal the wound he caused.”She also noted that Daming is not the first Indonesian official to make controversial comments about rape highlighting the case last year of Jakarta Governor Fauzi Bowo who said women should avoid wearing miniskirts on public transport to avoid “any unwanted consequences.”Indonesian political figures began to distance themselves from Daming amid the outrage this week and his chances of being selected as a Supreme Court justice seemed to wither.Opinion: Why have men lost touch with reality over rape?The chairman of the parliamentary commission Gede Pasek Suardika said that Daming’s remarks were inappropriate and that the public outcry against him would be taken into consideration. Members of the commission from the Prosperous Justice Party recommended against selecting him.The controversy that sprung up around Daming mirrors outrage in the United States over remarks about rape made by Republicans Richard Mourdock and Todd Akin.Once leading in the polls Mourdock and Akin both lost their Senate races to Democrats in November after their comments on pregnancy and rape were widely circulated.Read more: Divorce by text message sparks bizarre legal battle in IndonesiaWhen asked on a local news show what he thought about abortion in the case of rape Akin set off the controversy when he said “First of all from what I understand from doctors that’s really rare.

       " 'Just as the Affordable Care Act was the signature piece of legislation of President Obama’s first term the top achievement of term two is supposed to be immigration reform. And for a while with Republicans freaked out by the ground they have lost among Latino voters such legislation looked unstoppable. But now not so much.On Friday the Republican National Committee passed a resolution calling on Congress to pass immigration reform but the version of reform they want provides only renewable work permits not a path to citizenship for undocumented residents of the U.S.That is not what Obama and the Democrats have called for nor what Republican Sens. Marco Rubio and John McCain have been pushing nor what was hammered out in a Senate bill by the bipartisan “Gang of Eight.”All of them see a path to citizenship as a crucial element in the legislation. But the RNC’s position reflects the view of many Republicans including many members of the House GOP that no one should be rewarded for sneaking into the country even if they happened to be babies when they were sneaked in and have now grown up to go to college or serve in the military.AdvertisementDemocrats and pro-reform Republicans such as McCain and Rubio hoped to soften the hard line against offering citizenship by promising that border security would be beefed up even more than it has been. This is despite plenty of evidence that one big reason so many undocumented people have taken up residence in the United States is because crossing the border with Mexico has become so difficult and perilous. Where once Mexican citizens came and went with the rhythm of seasonal work now they stay because the border has been militarized.Nevertheless despite the possibility that more rigid border controls may actually be keeping Mexican nationals on this side of the border and despite the fact that illegal entries are at a 40-year low -- partly because of increased security but even more because of demographic and economic changes in Mexico -- many Republicans insist that many more millions of tax dollars need to be spent on a problem that is largely resolved.They get their wish in the current immigration legislation yet they show no inclination to reciprocate by giving an inch on citizenship -- even for the kids who grew up here and have no other country they want to call their own.Since the rise of tea party politicians in 2010 and the election of many of their kind to Congress the inflexible and sometimes irrational opposition of these right-wing absolutists has stymied sensible bipartisan legislation that could help fix a broad array of problems from creating jobs to building roads and bridges. Thanks to them immigration reform may be the next good idea that goes nowhere.',\n",
       " 'Alan GomezUSA TODAYHouse Democratic bill picks up third Republican co-sponsorBill mirrors Senate%27s immigration%2C but includes a border security plan drafted by GOPersCritics say it%27s too little too late%2C give immigration reform little chance of passing this yearWASHINGTON — A Democratic bill in the House to overhaul the nation\\'s immigration laws is picking up Republican support though well short of the votes needed to pass the measure.Rep. David Valadao R-Calif. on Wednesday became the third Republican to co-sponsor the bill which includes a pathway to citizenship for the nation\\'s 12 million undocumented immigrants.Valadao the son of Portuguese immigrants whose family runs a dairy farm said in an interview with USA TODAY that his background and that of his district which is 72% Hispanic was a big factor in his decision.\"I grew up in an immigrant family I grew up in an immigrant community and I work in an immigrant-dependent industry. So it\\'s not like this is a stretch for me\" he said.Valadao said the slow pace of immigration legislation in the House also contributed to his decision.\"This isn\\'t really a shot at leadership but more \\'Guys this is important to me we have to move and we have to be part of this solution\\'\" he said. \"It doesn\\'t matter how conservative of a district you come from - we have a system that we need to fix.\"Valado\\'s decision to join Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen R-Fla. and Jeff Denham R-Calif. in co-sponsoring the bill comes at a critical time for immigration reform in Congress.There are 231 Republicans in the House and the GOP leadership has overseen hearings on separate bills tackling individual immigration issues. It has not favored a single bill to handle all issues.A bill needs 218 votes to pass the House and the Democratic bill has 186 Democratic co-sponsors. Adding three GOP votes still falls well short of a majority for passage.The Senate passed a sweeping overhaul to the nation\\'s immigration laws in June that provides a pathway to citizenship for the country\\'s undocumented immigrants doubles the size of the Border Patrol and revamps the legal immigration system to bring in more high-tech and low-skilled workers.But even Sen. Marco Rubio R-Fla. one of the architects of that bill has questioned whether that bill is the best way forward. Rubio said Rubio\\'s spokesman Alex Conant said the \"all or nothing\" approach they took in the Senate \"would result in nothing.\"Rubio and House Republican leaders say they would rather move forward with the \"piecemeal\" approach in which Congress considers smaller bills that tackle individual pieces of the nation\\'s immigration laws.House committees have approved a handful of bills that address border security grant immigration enforcement powers to local and state police officers increase the number of visas for high-tech workers and require U.S. businesses to check the immigration status of new hires.House Speaker John Boehner R-Ohio has said he is \"hopeful\" that immigration could be voted on by the full House before the end of the year but he has given no timetable.\"These guys signing on (to the Democratic bill) are kind of like people left standing when the music stops in musical chairs\" said Mark Krikorian executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies which opposes the Senate immigration bill. \"Just as the prospects of a bill passing are declining these people are signing on.\"Supporters of the Democratic bill see something else happening.Frank Sharry executive director of America\\'s Voice a group that supports the Senate immigration bill said the increasing support of the Democratic bill puts more pressure on GOP leaders to get moving on immigration.\"Does it mean that this bill is going to be brought up sometime soon? Probably not\" Sharry said. \"But does it ratchet up the pressure on house leadership to get something going? Yeah. It\\'ll make it harder for House leadership to slow-walk this thing to death.\"The bill H.R. 15 is sponsored by Rep. Joe Garcia R-Fla. It is mostly a replica of the Senate\\'s immigration bill but it eliminates the $46 billion border security plan adopted in the Senate and replaces it with a border security plan authored by Rep. Michael McCaul R-Texas and was approved unanimously by the House Homeland Security Committee.Garcia said he was encouraged by the latest addition to his bill and said he\\'s pushing to bring more on board. He hopes it will reach a point where House leadership is forced to bring it to the floor where it could pass with most Democrats and a couple-dozen Republicans similar to the vote that ended the government shutdown.\"The same way we found votes on the budget I think Speaker Boehner will see the votes here\" Garcia said.',\n",
       " 'Just as the Affordable Care Act was the signature piece of legislation of President Obama’s first term the top achievement of term two is supposed to be immigration reform. And for a while with Republicans freaked out by the ground they have lost among Latino voters such legislation looked unstoppable. But now not so much.On Friday the Republican National Committee passed a resolution calling on Congress to pass immigration reform but the version of reform they want provides only renewable work permits not a path to citizenship for undocumented residents of the U.S.That is not what Obama and the Democrats have called for nor what Republican Sens. Marco Rubio and John McCain have been pushing nor what was hammered out in a Senate bill by the bipartisan “Gang of Eight.”All of them see a path to citizenship as a crucial element in the legislation. But the RNC’s position reflects the view of many Republicans including many members of the House GOP that no one should be rewarded for sneaking into the country even if they happened to be babies when they were sneaked in and have now grown up to go to college or serve in the military.AdvertisementDemocrats and pro-reform Republicans such as McCain and Rubio hoped to soften the hard line against offering citizenship by promising that border security would be beefed up even more than it has been. This is despite plenty of evidence that one big reason so many undocumented people have taken up residence in the United States is because crossing the border with Mexico has become so difficult and perilous. Where once Mexican citizens came and went with the rhythm of seasonal work now they stay because the border has been militarized.Nevertheless despite the possibility that more rigid border controls may actually be keeping Mexican nationals on this side of the border and despite the fact that illegal entries are at a 40-year low -- partly because of increased security but even more because of demographic and economic changes in Mexico -- many Republicans insist that many more millions of tax dollars need to be spent on a problem that is largely resolved.They get their wish in the current immigration legislation yet they show no inclination to reciprocate by giving an inch on citizenship -- even for the kids who grew up here and have no other country they want to call their own.Since the rise of tea party politicians in 2010 and the election of many of their kind to Congress the inflexible and sometimes irrational opposition of these right-wing absolutists has stymied sensible bipartisan legislation that could help fix a broad array of problems from creating jobs to building roads and bridges. Thanks to them immigration reform may be the next good idea that goes nowhere.',\n",
       " 'Should the local police and sheriff’s deputies be doing more to help the federal government enforce civil immigration laws? For years the disturbing answer from the Obama administration and hard-line states like Arizona has been: absolutely. Each has tried in its own way to expand the role of local law enforcement in catching unauthorized immigrants and feeding the deportation pipeline.But states and cities are rejecting the blurring of a once-bright line that separated local cops and federal immigration agents. They recognize that a broken immigration system has stranded many people outside the law but know that many have lived here for years with clean records and citizen children and would be on track to become Americans if the legislation now stalled in Congress ever passes. Deporting millions of harmless people — current taxpayers future citizens — is a misguided mission for the nation. For the local police it’s a costly and dangerous diversion from their main job: preventing crime and catching criminals.California and New Orleans are two places tackling this question with encouraging results. New Orleans has just settled a lengthy court battle to rein in a sheriff who had turned his jail cells into long-term holding pens for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A bill now moving through the California Legislature would strictly limit the role of local law enforcement in feeding inmates to ICE. Serious criminals would still be turned over for deportation but others in jail for minor offenses would not be held on ICE’s behalf.The New Orleans case involves a civil rights lawsuit brought by two immigrant workers who served short sentences for minor crimes then languished in prison for months waiting for ICE to pick them up. The sheriff of Orleans Parish Marlin Gusman complied with an ICE request to hold the men Mario Cacho and Antonio Ocampo over possible immigration violations. Such requests called detainers are supposed to have a time limit: ICE has 48 hours to take an inmate into custody. But Mr. Cacho was held for more than 160 days; Mr. Ocampo more than 90. There were no federal charges against either of them.',\n",
       " 'Back to previous pageEdward Snowden comes forward as source of NSA leaksBy Barton Gellman Aaron Blake and Greg MillerA 29-year-old man who says he is a former undercover CIA employee said Sunday that he was the principal source of recent disclosures about \\xadtop-secret National Security Agency programs exposing himself to possible prosecution in an acknowledgment that had little if any precedent in the long history of U.S. intelligence leaks.Edward Snowden a tech specialist who has contracted for the NSA and works for the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton unmasked himself as a source after a string of stories in The Washington Post and the Guardian that detailed previously unknown U.S. surveillance programs. He said he disclosed secret documents in response to what he described as the systematic surveillance of innocent citizens.In an interview Sunday Snowden said he is willing to face the consequences of exposure.“I’m not going to hide” Snowden told The Post from Hong Kong where he has been staying. “Allowing the U.S. government to intimidate its people with threats of retaliation for revealing wrongdoing is contrary to the public interest.”Asked whether he believes that his disclosures will change anything he said: “I think they already have. Everyone everywhere now understands how bad things have gotten — and they’re talking about it. They have the power to decide for themselves whether they are willing to sacrifice their privacy to the surveillance state.”Snowden said nobody had been aware of his actions including those closest to him. He said there was no single event that spurred his decision to leak the information but he said President Obama has failed to live up to his pledges of transparency.“My sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them” he said in a note that accompanied the first document he leaked to The Post.The Guardian was the first to publicly identify Snowden at his request.The White House said late Sunday that it would not have any comment on the matter.In a brief statement a spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the intelligence community is “reviewing the damage” the leaks have done. “Any person who has a security clearance knows that he or she has an obligation to protect classified information and abide by the law” said the spokesman Shawn Turner.Snowden said he is seeking “asylum from any countries that believe in free speech and oppose the victimization of global privacy” but the law appears to provide for his extradition from Hong Kong a semiautonomous territory of China to the United States.Although any extradition proceeding could take months or even years experts said Snowden has not put himself in a favorable position.“The fact that he outed himself and basically said from what I understand he has said ‘I feel very comfortable with what I have done’ . . . that’s not going to help him in his extradition contest” said Douglas McNabb a lawyer and extradition expert.The Justice Department said it is in the “initial stages of an investigation” into the unauthorized disclosure of classified information but declined to comment further.A stunning revelationCurrent and former U.S. intelligence officials said the revelation of Snowden’s role in the leaks will lead to a sweeping reexamination of security measures at the CIA and the NSA and they described his decision to come forward as a stunning conclusion to a week of disclosures that rattled the intelligence community.“This is significant on a number of fronts: the scope the range. It’s major it’s major” said John Rizzo a former general counsel of the CIA who worked at the agency for decades. “And then to have him out himself . . . I can’t think of any previous leak case involving a CIA officer where the officer raised his hand and said ‘I’m the guy.’ ”A half-dozen former intelligence officials including one who now works at Booz Allen Hamilton said they did not know Snowden or anything about his background. Several former officials said he easily could have been part of a surge in computer experts and technical hires brought in by the CIA in the years after the Sept. 11 2001 attacks as its budget and mission swelled.“Like a lot of things after 9/11 they just went on a hiring binge and in the technical arena young smart nerds were in high demand” a former U.S. intelligence official said. “There were battalions of them.”Officials said the CIA and other spy agencies did not relax their screening measures as the workforce expanded. Still several officials said the CIA will now undoubtedly begin reviewing the process by which Snowden may have been hired seeking to determine whether there were any missed signs that he might one day betray national secrets.More broadly the CIA and the NSA may be forced to reexamine their relationships with contractors who were employed in roles ranging from technical support to paramilitary operations before concerns about the outsourcing of such sensitive assignments prompted a backlash in Congress and pledges from the agencies to begin thinning their contracting ranks.Some former CIA officials said they were troubled by aspects of Snowden’s background at least as he described it to The Post and the Guardian.For instance Snowden said he did not have a high school diploma. One former CIA official said that it was extremely unusual for the agency to have hired someone with such thin academic credentials particularly for a technical job and that the terms Snowden used to describe his agency positions did not match internal job descriptions.Snowden’s claim to have been placed under diplomatic cover for a position in Switzerland after an apparently brief stint at the CIA as a systems administrator also raised suspicion. “I just have never heard of anyone being hired with so little academic credentials” the former CIA official said. The agency does employ technical specialists in overseas stations the former official said “but their breadth of experience is huge and they tend not to start out as systems administrators.”A former senior U.S. intelligence official cited other puzzling aspects of Snowden’s account questioning why a contractor for Booz Allen at an NSA facility in Hawaii would have access to something as sensitive as a court order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.“I don’t know why he would have had access to those . . . orders out in Hawaii” the former official said.The Guardian initially reported the existence of a program that collects data on all phone calls made on the Verizon network. Later in the week the Guardian and The Post reported the existence of a separate program code-named PRISM that collects the Internet data of foreigners from major Internet companies.Snowden expressed hope that the NSA surveillance programs will now be open to legal challenge for the first time. This year in Amnesty International v. Clapper the Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit against the mass collection of phone records because the plaintiffs could not prove exactly what the program did or that they were personally subject to surveillance.“The government can’t reasonably assert the state-secrets privilege for a program it has acknowledged” Snowden said.Journalists criticizedSnowden’s name surfaced as top intelligence officials in the Obama administration and Congress pushed back against the journalists responsible for revealing the existence of sensitive surveillance programs and called for an investigation into the leaks.Clapper in an interview with NBC that aired Saturday night condemned the leaker’s actions but also sought to spotlight the journalists who first reported the programs calling their disclosures irresponsible and full of “hyperbole.” Earlier Saturday he issued a statement accusing the media of a “rush to publish.”“For me it is literally — not figuratively — literally gut-wrenching to see this happen because of the huge grave damage it does to our intelligence capabilities” Clapper said.On Sunday morning before Snowden’s unmasking House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) had harsh words for the leaker and for the journalist who first reported the NSA’s collection of phone records the Guardian’s Glenn Greenwald.Greenwald “doesn’t have a clue how this thing works; neither did the person who released just enough information to literally be dangerous” Rogers said on ABC’s “This Week” adding: “I absolutely think [the leaker] should be prosecuted.”Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) agreed that whoever leaked the information should be prosecuted and she sought to beat back media reports suggesting that the Obama administration overplayed the impact of the programs.After opponents of the programs questioned their value last week anonymous administration officials pointed to the thwarting of a bomb plot targeting the New York City subway system in 2009. Soon after though reporters noted that public documents suggested that regular police work was responsible for thwarting the attack rather than a secret government intelligence program.Feinstein said the programs were valuable in both the New York case and in another involving an American plotting to bomb a hotel in India in 2008. She noted that she could talk about those two cases because they have been declassified but she suggested that the surveillance programs also assisted in other terrorism-related cases.A chief critic of the efforts Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said he is considering filing a lawsuit against the government and called on 10 million Americans to join in.“I’m going to be asking all the Internet providers and all of the phone companies ask your customers to join me in a class-action lawsuit” Paul said on “Fox News Sunday.”Sari Horwitz and Julie Tate contributed to this report.',\n",
       " 'This post has been updated. See below for details.SACRAMENTO — A day after FBI agents raided the Capitol office of Sen. Ron Calderon (D-Montebello) local officials from Southern California said they have been interviewed by federal agents about the senator’s connection to a local water board.While the U.S. Attorney’s office on Wednesday remained mum about the focus of the investigation the Central Basin Municipal Water District has been at the center of a number of controversies for years. Some of those controversies have focused on the Calderon family’s relationship with the district.FOR THE RECORD:Calderon investigation: An article in the June 6 Section A about an FBI investigation into Sen. Ron Calderon (D-Montebello) said that the senator’s brother former Assemblyman Tom Calderon received $140000 per year from the company Water2Save which was chosen for a project by the Central Basin Municipal Water District. Tom Calderon’s $140000-per-year contract was with Central Basin. He had a separate consulting contract with Water2Save.Among those who have raised public concerns about the district is Congresswoman Grace Napolitano (D-Norwalk). In an interview Wednesday she said she has heard complaints from cities she represents dating back more than a decade about the Central Basin Water District’s lack of transparency and questionable spending of public funds.AdvertisementIN DEPTH: Calderon targeted by FBIIn particular Napolitano questioned how the district spent $5.6 million in federal funds she helped secure to build infrastructure for a regional system to recycle water.The district received a subsequent research grant from the Department of Energy in conjunction with HydroEarth a Lake Forest-based water management firm. But instead of moving forward with the original research proposal Central Basin amended the project and opened it up for competitive bidding. Staffers subsequently chose to partner with a different company Water2Save a firm that paid Ron Calderon’s brother former Assemblyman Tom Calderon $140000 per year.[UPDATED: 3:22 p.m. June 5: Tom Calderon also received more than $10000 per month as a consultant for the district.]AdvertisementQuestions emerged from cities in the area about increased water rates and how the district was spending that money. Napolitano said she was never able to get answers about what was happening.“It was just ridiculous” she said. “This is ratepayer money. It’s not the Central Basin’s money.”In 2009 she pushed for state auditors to step in and examine the board’s proposed rate hike its spending of federal stimulus dollars and review its spending on lobbying and political consultants.Napolitano blames Ron Calderon for thwarting her audit request. “I was concerned there was state money too that was being misused” she said.AdvertisementShe said Calderon assured state officials he would convene meetings of local stakeholders to work through their concerns. Those meetings never happened according to Napolitano.Concerns extend to cities that are members of the Central Basin Water District.“There’s been a lot of seemingly dubious things in regards to their contracts the costs of certain projects and how they spend their money” said Thaddeus McCormack city manager for Santa Fe Springs. “We’ve had questions for a long time. Now we may finally get some answers to those questions.”One of McCormack’s concerns involved the Calderons. “Tom is a paid consultant to the district. We believe the senator is an advocate for them. That connection never seemed comfortable” he said. “It’s raised eyebrows for years.”AdvertisementIn 2011 Ron Calderon introduced a bill that would have given the Central Basin control over groundwater in the area part of an ongoing rivalry between Central Basin and a neighboring water district.The bill died in the Senate without ever having a hearing.Another city official in Los Angeles County who declined to be identified speaking about the investigation said he spoke with the FBI about the water district.The conversation focused on consulting contracts held by Tom Calderon and legislation authored by Ron Calderon the official said.Advertisement“That was 100% of what they were asking about” the official added.Note: An earlier version of this post said that Tom Calderon is a paid consultant for the water district.

       " 'Story highlights NEW: The top U.S. intel official says leaks affect national security Some say the program is key to fighting terrorism and includes oversight The program was used to stop \"terrorist plots\" on U.S. soil Sen. Feinstein says Critics say it\\'s overreach with Al Gore calling it \"obscenely outrageous\"(CNN) —Frightening government overreach or valuable law enforcement tool?That’s the question politicians in Washington and millions of citizens around the United States asked Thursday thanks to a jolting report suggesting the government has been collecting millions of Americans’ phone records.FBI Direct Robert Mueller will be asked about the matter – revealed after a British newspaper the Guardian published a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court order that applied to phone data from Verizon – when he appears next week before the House Judiciary Committee. The panel’s chairman Bob Goodlatte R-Virginia issued a statement Thursday saying he was “very concerned that the Department of Justice may have abused the intent of the law and we will investigate.”Reports: U.S. spy agencies mined Internet dataThe report will also be the subject of an upcoming classified briefing by Attorney General Eric Holder to the Senate Appropriations Committee. Its chairman Sen. Barbara Mikulski is calling for a similar closed-door briefing for the entire U.S. Senate.When she read the news Thursday morning the Maryland Democrat said “It was like ‘Oh God not one more thing … where we’re trying to protect America and then it looks like we’re spying.’”What does the Verizon order mean for me?An author of the Patriot Act – the legislation used to justify the program – added he is “extremely disturbed by what appears to be an overbroad interpretation of the act.”“These reports are deeply concerning and raise questions about whether our constitutional rights are secure” Rep. James Sensenbrenner R-Wisconsin wrote in a letter to Holder.But not everyone in the nation’s capital is outraged or even concerned. Some say the real travesty would be if the program which they describe as valuable is halted.Sen. Dianne Feinstein chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee said the Guardian story refers to a “three-month renewal of what has been the case for the past seven years” – so that while the uproar may be new the program is not. In that time it’s helped to disrupt “terrorist plots” on U.S. soil she said.“It is lawful” the California Democrat insisted. “It has been briefed by Congress.”Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Michigan) and Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Maryland) two key members of the House Intelligence Committee both stressed that “this important collection tool does not allow the government to eavesdrop” and that it is routinely reviewed by Congress.White House spokesman Josh Earnest also made those points adding President Barack Obama “put in place a stronger regime of oversight” when he took office. He further stressed the importance of ensuring “we have the tools we need to confront the threat posted by terrorists (and to) protect the homeland.”“That is his top priority” Earnest said of domestic security. “But … we need to balance that priority with the need to protect civil liberties and constitutional rights of American people. And that is the subject of a worthy debate.”What’s been happening and for how long?In 2006 it was reported the National Security Agency was secretly collecting telephone records in an effort to root out terror plots.“Verizon’s wireless and wireline companies did not provide to NSA customer records or call data local or otherwise” the company said at the time.Like the FBI and the NSA Verizon declined comment to the media Thursday on the Guardian report. But company Vice President Randy Milch in a note to employees did say the newspaper’s story may spur the company to respond in defiance of a promise of secrecy.The newspaper published the four-page top-secret government order requiring “originating and terminating” phone numbers plus the location time and duration of calls from the communications giant. It lets the FBI and NSA to obtain the records from April 25 to July 19.7 things to knowThe order applies to Verizon Business Network Services an operation not described on the company’s website. Its scope was not immediately clear though the Guardian claimed “millions of U.S. customers of Verizon” were affected by the collection of information “regardless of whether they are suspected of wrongdoing.”In his letter to Verizon employees Milch said that his company would not provide the contents of any communications “or the name address or financial information of a subscriber or customer.”An Obama administration official said any such order would relate “exclusively to metadata such as a telephone number or the length of a call.”This kind of information “allows counterterrorism personnel to discover whether known or suspected terrorists have been in contact with other persons who may be engaged in terrorist activities” the unnamed official said in a statement to media.Controversy over the Guardian report comes as the White House fends off privacy complaints on other fronts as well. The administration is under fire following revelations the Justice Department seized two months of phone records from Associated Press reporters and editors – something done as part of an investigation into leaks of classified information.Plus the Washington Post and the Guardian reported that U.S. intelligence has a broad secret data mining program that allows access to central servers of nine leading U.S. Internet companies – among them Microsoft Yahoo Google Facebook and Apple – to extract e-mail photos and other private consumer communications.Director of National Intelligence James Clapper challenged the Post and Guardian reports in a statement Thursday night saying “they contain numerous inaccuracies.” Specifically he emphasized the section of the law tied to that reported program “cannot be used to intentionally target any U.S. citizen any other U.S. person or anyone located within the United States.”In statements on that and reports about collecting phone data Clapper also called out those behind the apparent leaks – saying it “will have an impact on the behavior of our adversaries and make it more difficult for us to understand their intentions.”Speaking specifically about collecting personal phone records privacy advocates called the practice perilous and claimed it gives authorities access to information of many Americans who aren’t terrorists. In fact they might not necessarily be Verizon customers and similar orders might also apply to other telecommunications companies.“There is no indication that this order to Verizon was unique or novel” said the Electronic Frontier Foundation which fights to protect privacy.“It is very likely that business records orders like this exist for every major American telecommunication company meaning that if you make calls in the United States the NSA has those records. And this has been going on for at least seven years and probably longer.”Opinion: NSA’s phone snooping a different kind of creepyAl Gore: ‘Secret blanket surveillance obscenely outrageous’This group is hardly alone.The American Civil Liberties Union called it “beyond Orwellian (in allowing) basic democratic rights (to be) surrendered in secret to the demands of unaccountable intelligence agencies.”The Center for Constitutional Rights blasted it as “the broadest surveillance order to ever had been issued: It requires no level of suspicion.”Many in President Barack Obama’s own party spoke forcefully against it as well.Three Democratic representatives – John Conyers of Michigan Jerrold Nadler of New York and Robert Scott of Virginia – said the program is “highly problematic and reveals serious flaws in the scope and application of the” Patriot Act.“(The revelations) confirm our fears – that the law would be distorted to allow for ongoing indiscriminate collection of data” they wrote.Sen. Mark Udall who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee described the program as “the kind of government overreach I’ve said Americans would find shocking.”One of them: former Vice President Al Gore.“Is it just me or is secret blanket surveillance obscenely outrageous?” the 2000 Democratic presidential nominee wrote on Twitter.Senator says ending program would be ‘catastrophic’Opinions were also strong on the other side of the debate.“Terrorists will come after us if they can and the only thing that we have to deter this is good intelligence to understand that a plot has been hatched and to get there before they get to us” said Feinstein.Her intelligence committee’s ranking Republican Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia concurred in stating the program has let authorities gather “significant information on bad guys and only on bad guys over the years.”Former FBI Assistant Director Tom Fuentes a CNN contributor said that if a phone number comes up that’s linked to someone suspicious they can go back and get information tied to that number.“It’s not that someone or some group of analysts can sit there and monitor 50 million phone calls going through the computers” Fuentes explained on CNN’s “Starting Point.” “But it would create the ability to go back and see if you could connect phone calls.”Rep. Lindsey Graham said that as a Verizon customer “it doesn’t bother me one bit for the National Security Administration to have my phone number.” The South Carolina Republican said he’s confident the government won’t monitor his and other innocent Americans phone calls just because their “number pops up on some terrorist’s phone.”“The consequences of taking these tools away from the American people through their government would be catastrophic” he said.CNN’s Chelsea J.

       " 'Story highlights NEW: President Obama says \"we just need Congress to finish the job\" The 68-32 Senate vote sends the measure to the House for consideration Speaker Boehner says the House will stick to its own version of immigration reform The Senate bill offers a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants(CNN) —The U.S. Senate gave final approval Thursday to a roughly 1200-page bill that promises to overhaul immigration laws for the first time since 1986 creating a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented residents while ratcheting up security along the Mexican border.Senators passed the sweeping legislation – initially drafted by the four Democrats and four Republicans in the chamber’s so-called “Gang of Eight” – by a 68-32 vote.Fourteen Republicans joined a united Democratic caucus in supporting the bill which is backed by the White House and has the potential to become the crowning legislative achievement of President Barack Obama’s second term.In a White House statement Obama hailed the Senate vote as “a critical step” toward fixing what he called a broken immigration system. He labeled the measure that now goes to the Republican-controlled House a compromise adding that “we just need Congress to finish the job.”The Senate vote included a rare adherence to old-fashioned protocol. Vice President Joe Biden presided in his constitutional capacity as head of the Senate and senators voted one-by-one from their desks calling out “aye” or “no.”Republican Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas broke the drama of the moment when he mistakenly voted “aye” then quickly asked the clerk to make it “no” as the chamber erupted in laughter. Biden tapped his gavel and called for order.Before announcing the result Biden warned against outbursts from the public gallery but chants of “Yes we can” and “Si se puede” broke out after he read the tally. Biden called for the sergeant at arms to restore order.“Today is another historic day in the Senate” said Sen. Patrick Leahy D-Vermont. “This legislation will reunite families. It will bring millions of people out of the shadows and into our legal system. It will spur job growth and reduce our deficit. And it will make us safer.”“The time has come to act in the interest of all Americans” declared Sen. Bob Menendez D-New Jersey a member of the Gang of Eight. “I hope that message will be heard loud and clear in the House (of Representatives).”Historic ruling opens door for immigration for same-sex spousesMost congressional conservatives however remain staunchly opposed to the measure and have declared it dead on arrival in the House.Obama warned in his statement that opponents of immigration reform will try even harder to derail it. Noting the broad support for the Senate bill from the business community organized labor and others he urged people to contact their House representatives and “tell them to do the right thing.”Republicans are sharply divided over the politically sensitive issue. In the wake of the GOP’s crushing loss among Hispanics in the 2012 election many top voices in the party have pushed for an endorsement of some form of a path to citizenship for the country’s roughly 11 million undocumented residents.“No one should dispute (that) like every sovereign nation on this planet we have a right to control who comes in. But unlike other countries we are not afraid of people coming in here from other places” said Florida Sen. Marco Rubio the most prominent Republican in the Gang of Eight and a potential 2016 presidential candidate. “I support this reform. Not just because I believe in immigrants but because I believe in America even more.”For many of the GOP’s strongest supporters any path to citizenship for those who entered the country illegally is a form of unforgivable amnesty. They also don’t trust the Obama administration to fully enact the bill’s new border security measures which are generally opposed by progressives.“There’s just no way I can look my constituents in the eye and tell them that today’s assurances won’t become tomorrow’s disappointments” said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell R-Kentucky. “We’ll never resolve the immigration problem on a bipartisan basis either now or in the future until we can prove that the border is secure as a condition of legalization.”Senate takes another step toward passing immigration reformSen. Mike Lee R-Utah called the vote on the measure “largely symbolic” and predicted the bill would ultimately be relegated to the “ash heap of history.”If enacted the measure would create a 13-year path to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants while raising the cap on visas for high skilled workers and establishing a new visa program for low skilled workers on America’s farms.A recently added border security amendment – introduced by GOP Sens. John Hoeven of North Dakota and Bob Corker of Tennessee – would require 20000 more border agents complete 700 miles of fence along the boundary with Mexico and deploy $3.2 billion in technology upgrades similar to equipment used by U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.The amendment also strengthens eligibility verification and border entry-exit controls.Most undocumented immigrants would be eligible for permanent residency only after the five conditions have been met and verified by the Department of Homeland Security.While Corker’s and Hoeven’s change appeared to sway some reticent Republicans in the Senate top House Republicans remained opposed the overall blueprint.“Apparently some haven’t gotten the message: the House is not going to take up and vote on whatever the Senate passes” said Speaker John Boehner R-Ohio. “We’re going to do our own bill … and move the legislation that reflects the will of our majority and the will of the American people.”House Republicans have indicated their intention to tackle the issue with several smaller proposals instead of one larger bill.Boehner repeated his pledge to block a vote on any immigration measure that doesn’t have the support of a majority of House Republicans. Democrats contend the Senate version would pass the House if brought to a vote with a united Democratic caucus joined by some Republicans.The speaker also refused to take a position on whether or not there should be some kind of path to citizenship for those who entered the country illegally.Democrats have repeatedly warned they will not agree to a plan that lacks such a path.Regardless Boehner said he hopes the House will deal with immigration reform this year.“I have made it clear since the day after the election that this political football should stop and that the Congress should deal with this issue” he said.Farm bill failure portends problems for immigration in the HouseCNN’s Dana Bash Tom Cohen Ted Barrett and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report',\n",

The Tsarnaev family which is ethnically Chechen was granted asylum because it feared persecution in its home country according to media reports.Tamerlan\\'s application for citizenship was put on hold in 2012 by the government because he had been questioned by the FBI at the request of the Russian government for possible ties to Chechen terrorism the New York Times reported. Dzhokhar\\'s citizenship application was approved and he naturalized in 2012.At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing over the bill on Tuesday Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano defended immigration officials\\' handling of the Tsarnaevs saying the process for granting asylum is rigorous.\"In the past four years we have increased both the number and the coverage of the vetting that goes on\" Napolitano said. As things currently stand she noted those who seek asylum must go through multiple screening interviews and submit biometric data to be checked across government databases. If granted asylum and legal status immigrants must go through two more interviews if they want to become citizens when they become eligible five years later.(Asylum applicants must show that they face government-sanctioned persecution in their home country stemming from their race religion nationality political views or membership in a particular social group.)Story continuesNapolitano argued that the immigration reform bill would make the country safer because the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country would be brought \"out of the shadows\" and screened. The bill requires immigrants to pass a background check before they are eligible for temporary legal status. They must pay fines and back taxes and enroll in English classes to gain permanent legal status.Opponents of the immigration bill have argued that the Tsarnaevs\\' alleged crime suggests that the current immigration system is unable to weed out potential terrorists and that the process of crafting the bill should be slowed down to address that. If the bill is stalled until next fall opponents hope it will be close enough to the next election that on-the-fence lawmakers will withdraw their support effectively killing the bill. President Barack Obama has said he hopes the bill will pass this summer.Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach one of the most prominent opponents of legalizing immigrants said at Monday\\'s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that the legalization process in the bill could present a national security threat.\"The background checks in this bill are insufficient from preventing a terrorist from getting amnesty\" Kobach said.Supporters of the immigration reform bill say the argument is a specious excuse to delay the legislation.\"Unless we are able to design an immigration background check that can get into the minds of people and predict the future then we won\\'t be able to solve problems like this through immigration screening alone\" said Lynn Tramonte of America\\'s Voice a pro-immigration advocacy group.It\\'s also unclear how the immigration system could have known what two children seeking asylum with their family would do 10 years later.But even some lawmakers who have indicated their support for the bill have raised concern about the Boston suspects.Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky who has been a vocal supporter of immigration reform wrote in a letter to Majority Leader Harry Reid that the immigration reform process should stop until all the facts are known about the intersection between the immigration system and the Tsarnaev brothers.\"Why did the current system allow two individuals to immigrate to the United States from the Chechen Republic in Russia an area known as a hotbed of Islamic extremism who then committed acts of terrorism? Were there any safeguards? Could this have been prevented? Does the immigration reform before us address this?\" Paul asked.He said Congress should debate whether immigrants from \"high-risk\" nations should face more \"scrutiny\" and whether student visas for people from certain \"high-risk\" countries altogether should be discontinued.Sen. Dan Coats R-Ind. said on ABC on Sunday that he hopes lawmakers will put the immigration debate \"on hold\" because of the bombing.Roy Beck of NumbersUSA a group that opposes illegal immigration and wants to dramatically lower rates of legal immigration said he thinks it\\'s significant that Paul and Coats have called for slowing down the bill.\"The Boston bombing gives them a little more of a public reason to try to get this to slow down\" Beck said.If the bill is delayed until the fall Republicans and red-state Democrats might think it is too close to election season to support it Beck predicts.',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON — While much of the debate over immigration has focused on the fate of the estimated 11 million people in the U.S. without legal authorization one of the biggest immediate impacts of the reform bill being prepared in the Senate would be a sudden large surge in legal migration.The U.S. admits about 1 million legal immigrants per year more than any other country. That number could jump by more than 50% over the next decade under the terms of the immigration reform bill that a bipartisan group of senators expects to unveil as early as Tuesday. The impact would be felt nationwide but areas that already have large immigrant communities would probably see much of the increase.AdvertisementThe immigration package includes at least four major provisions that would increase the number of legal immigrants according to people familiar with it. Some of the parts could generate as much controversy as the provisions dealing with those who enter the country illegally or overstay their visas according to those with long experience of the politics of immigration.PHOTOS: The immigration reform debateAdvertisementSupporters say that higher levels of legal immigration would meet the U.S. need for certain kinds of workers. Increased legal migration also would reduce most of the incentive for illegal border crossings backers of the plan say and would allow border agents to focus on smugglers and people with violent criminal records.Opponents such as Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) who has long opposed measures to increase immigration levels say new workers would depress wages and crowd out Americans looking for work during a time of persistently high unemployment.Advertisement“The masters of the universe in glass towers and suites they may not be impacted by this but millions of struggling American families will” Sessions said in an interview Friday. “We do need to be sure we aren’t exacerbating unemployment and wage erosion in America.”The surge would come in several ways: The bill aims to eliminate the current backlog of roughly 4 million people waiting to be reunited with family members in the U.S. The 11 million now in the country without legal authorization would be eligible for citizenship only after that backlog was resolved. Reunification efforts would require boosting the number of visas issued each year. To keep the additional inflow under control the bill would stop allowing adult siblings of immigrants to qualify but children and parents would continue to be eligible.AdvertisementU.S. immigration law: Decades of debateIn addition to family unification which allows people into the country permanently the bill also aims to increase temporary visas for both high-wage and low-wage workers. The number of visas for high-tech workers could nearly double to more than 120000 per year. At the other end of the wage scale a new visa system would allow businesses to bring in workers for jobs including janitors housekeepers and meatpackers. The numbers would start small but as the unemployment rate declined it could reach 200000 a year by the end of the decade. And growers could bring a total of about 330000 new farmworkers into the country during the decade. At least some of those low-wage temporary workers eventually would be allowed to seek permanent residency.AdvertisementThe bill’s authors expect that legal immigration eventually would decline again but only 10 years after the bill passed once the backlog of residency applications shrank.“The increased number in the years following the enactment of this bill reflects us having to clean up what has been a broken immigration system for many years” said Angela Kelley an immigration expert at the Center for American Progress a liberal policy group in Washington.Advertisement“We had too few visas for too long” Kelley said. “Congress hasn’t upgraded our immigration system in 23 years.”The last time Congress overhauled the admissions process for immigrants was the Immigration Act of 1990. In the years after the bill’s passage the total number of legal immigrants increased by 40% from about 500000 per year to more than 700000.AdvertisementBut the new system didn’t allow enough flexibility as the U.S. continued to shift from a manufacturing-based economy to a knowledge-based economy said Audrey Singer immigration policy expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington.“How do we get this right?” Singer asked. “The question is can we come up with a mechanism that allows us to have a more adjustable system over time and have more flexibility?”AdvertisementIn theory legal immigration has broad public support in both parties. In practice changes to the immigration system can generate fierce political opposition.Limiting the ability of immigrants to bring their adult siblings to the U.S. would be controversial particularly with Asian American lawmakers and their constituents. Asian Americans use that category more heavily than other immigrant groups. The bill also would limit visas for married sons and daughters of U.S. citizens to people under the age of 30 which could generate opposition. On the other hand the bill would allow lawful permanent residents to sponsor spouses and minor children for green cards. Currently only U.S. citizens can do that. That change likely to please immigrant groups could bring in an additional 800000 people over the next 10 years Senate aides said.AdvertisementHouse Republican leaders have been meeting with members to discuss immigration and the future flow of legal immigrants has been among the top issues raised according to officials familiar with the sessions. Because of the way many congressional district boundaries were redrawn after the 2010 census few Republicans have large immigrant communities among their constituents leaving many newer lawmakers unfamiliar with the issues.“Everybody’s all over the map” said Rep. James Lankford (R-Okla.) who has been helping coordinate the sessions for the GOP leadership. “There’s an economic benefit” to the changes being contemplated “if we have the right formula set up” he said. “It’s people who are coming in for economic benefit rather than just family connection.”AdvertisementFULL COVERAGE: U.S. immigration newsConvincing reluctant Republicans of the economic benefits of legal immigration has become easier with the support of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce some in the GOP said. Business owners have lobbied Republicans recounting stories about their struggles to find workers for certain types of jobs.AdvertisementJonathan Johnson president of the bargain site Overstock.com based in Salt Lake City said his firm had struggled to hire enough computer programmers and software developers to expand the business.“We pay more and they are still hard to fill” he said.Advertisement“We need to be more free in letting people in” Johnson said. “That helps us solve our border problem.

       " 'Liberals and labor leaders hailed Mr. Perez calling him a champion for workers and those who have faced discrimination. “At a time when our politics tilts so heavily toward corporations and the very wealthy our country needs leaders like Tom Perez to champion the cause of ordinary working people” said Richard L. Trumka president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.James P. Hoffa general president of the Teamsters called Mr. Perez “the right choice” because of his history of advocacy. “In these difficult economic times” Mr. Hoffa said “workers need a fighter at the Labor Department who will stand up for them and they are getting just that with Thomas Perez.”While at the Justice Department Mr. Perez has pursued a record number of discrimination or brutality claims against local police and sheriff’s departments including that of Joe Arpaio the outspoken sheriff in Maricopa County Ariz. who was accused of “a pattern of unlawful discrimination” against Latinos.Mr. Perez also challenged voter identification requirements imposed by South Carolina and Texas and his division reached the three largest residential fair lending settlements in the history of the Fair Housing Act. Under him the voting section participated in the most new litigation in the last fiscal year than in any previous year.He has spent a career fighting discrimination cases as a federal prosecutor then under President Bill Clinton as deputy chief of the Civil Rights Division and finally as head of civil rights enforcement at the Health and Human Services Department. Mr. Perez also served as an elected council member in Montgomery County Md. and as the state’s secretary of labor licensing and regulation.Though his father died when he was 12 his family pressed the value of education so much that all four of his siblings became doctors. Mr. Perez 51 graduated from Brown University and Harvard Law School.“My parents taught my four siblings and me to work hard to give back to our community and to make sure that the ladder of opportunity was there for those coming after us” Mr. Perez said at the White House on Monday as he addressed the crowd in both English and Spanish. “Over my career I’ve learned that true progress is possible if you keep an open mind listen to all sides and focus on results.”',\n",

       " '“We are the ones we’ve been waiting for. We are the change we seek” candidate Barack Obama said in 2008. At the time his comments came in for criticism: They were narcissistic; they were tautological; they didn’t make a whole lot of sense.But in the aftermath of Obama’s 2012 reelection and his second inaugural address his 2008 remarks seem less a statement of self-absorption than one of prophecy. There is an Obama majority in American politics symbolized by Monday’s throng on the Mall whose existence is both the consequence of profound changes to our nation’s composition and values and the cause of changes yet to come.That majority as the president made clear in his remarks would not exist but for Americans’ struggles to expand our foundational belief in the equality of all men. The drive to expand equality he said in his speech’s most historically resonant line “is the star that guides us still just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall.”Our history Obama argued is one of adapting our ideals to a changing world. His speech (like recent books by Michael Lind and my Post colleague E.J. Dionne Jr.) reclaimed U.S. history from the misrepresentations of both constitutional originalists and libertarian fantasists. “Fidelity to our founding principles requires new responses to new challenges” the president said. “Preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action. For the American people can no more meet the demands of today’s world by acting alone than American soldiers could have met the forces of fascism or communism with muskets and militias.”Having established that the moral and practical arc of U.S. history bends toward equality Obama vowed to push his demands for equality still further — to ending the systemic underpayment of female workers; the voter suppression that compels some Americans usually minorities to wait hours to cast their votes; the deportations of immigrants who would otherwise help build the economy; and the laws that forbid gay Americans to marry.1 of 68 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Obama View Photos A collection of cartoons of the president. Caption A collection of cartoons of the president. Wait 1 second to continue.As the president acknowledged however social equality is rising even as the relative economic equality that once defined American life has sharply and broadly receded. “Our country cannot succeed” he said “when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it.” For this Obama prescribed revamping our taxes and reforming our schools but these are by no means sufficient to transform our nation into one that as the president put it “rewards the effort and determination of every single American.” The waning of the middle class is with climate change the most vexing item on the president’s agenda and requires far-reaching solutions beyond any he laid out. U.S. workers must regain the power they once had to bargain for their wages but that only begins the list of economic reforms that are as difficult to achieve as they are necessary to re-create an financially vibrant nation.The president closed his speech by asking his supporters to join him to help “shape the debates of our time.” The biggest mistake Obama made when he took office was to effectively disband the organization of the millions of Americans who had worked for his election — for fear in part that it might upset members of Congress whose votes he would need for his policies. He wants no such unilateral political disarmament now; his operatives hope to keep his 2012 campaign’s volunteer army in the field for the legislative battles ahead. Obama’s legions have proven that they can win elections and this matters a great deal more the president has learned than whatever trace elements of goodwill he may win by deferring to Congress.The Obama Majority — its existence and mobilization — is what enabled the president to deliver so ideological an address. No such inaugural speech has been delivered since Ronald Reagan took office in 1981 demanding the curtailment of government programs and secure in the knowledge that much of the white working class had shifted its allegiance away from the Democrats and supported his attack on the public sector and minority rights. On Monday Obama secure in the knowledge that the nation’s minorities had joined with other liberal constituencies to form a new governing coalition voiced their demands to ensure equality and to preserve and expand the government’s efforts to meet the nation’s challenges. As he left the stage he stopped and turned to marvel at the crowd at the new American majority they represented. They were the ones he and we were waiting for.Read more from Harold Meyerson’s archive or follow him on Twitter.',\n",

       " \"Maybe I shouldn't be surprised that anyone would think this in this country much less say it aloud but here it is:How can conservatives adjust their strategy to appeal more strongly to the single female society? Well one obvious approach would be restricting the vote to people who are married.Now I'm not quite sure how that's supposed to appeal to single women. It seems to me that if you just go ahead and disenfranchise single women (or blacks or Latinos or poor people or people who don't drive for whatever reason) well then that solves your problem right there. No need to have policies or platforms that appeal to people who can't vote right? So it's kind of illogical on its face. But it's also just mind-bogglingly bizarro as well.A couple of quotes from the comments:The goal of the GOP should be to resist urbanization not just because of the voting trends but because urban life leads to a lower standard of living.Speaking as someone with a paid off mortgage I still oppose the idea of property owners being the cut point. Taxpayer is a perfectly good one. Best would be to first seize the vocabulary change out 'entitlement' for 'public charity.' Then anyone who declares themselves destitute and in need of public charity would be a lot easier to drop from the voter rolls. They would have declared themselves incapable of maintaining themselves; why do they get to tell the rest of us how to run the country if they can't take care of themselves?So people who live in cities shouldn't vote either I guess?I knew about only allowing property owners to vote...Now my little diary doesn't explore the author's myriad reasons why single women are the problem but here's his opening generalization:The single female demographic doesn’t get hung up on details. Another of the new liberal icons Wendy Davis of Texas couldn’t answer basic questions about the abortion legislation she opposed with a purportedly heroic filibuster. Now she’s claiming she is actually kinda sorta “pro life” when you think about it. This is true of all the emotional appeals directed at single female society – lack of knowledge is not only overshadowed by passionate conviction it can be a point of pride.I was mainly just impressed by how much Red State conservatives don't want people to vote to the point where disenfranchisement is a Serious Discussion.I can only conclude that it's because what Kos always says about our base if our people vote WE WIN.Thanks for listening.

       " 'The tea party returned to Capitol Hill on Wednesday but this time the don’t-tread-on-me crowd trod upon one of its own.Much of the scene was familiar: the yellow flags the banners protesting tyranny and socialism the demands to impeach President Obama and to repeal Obamacare. But there was a new target of the conservatives’ ire: Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and his “amnesty” plan for illegal immigrants. The loathing of this onetime darling of the movement — Rubio rode the tea party wave to office in 2010 — could be seen in the homemade signs on the East Lawn of the Capitol proclaiming “Rubio RINO” (Republican In Name Only) and “Rubio Lies Americans Die.” Rubio antagonism became a main theme of the event held by Republican Reps. Steve King (Iowa) Louie Gohmert (Tex.) Michele Bachmann (Minn.) and other opponents of the bipartisan Senate immigration legislation that Rubio negotiated.The lawmakers called to the microphone the Heritage Foundation’s Robert Rector who delivered a sustained rebuke of the turncoat. “Marco Rubio” he charged “has not read his own bill.”A chorus of boos rose from the crowd of several hundred.Rector mocked the claim that the legislation wouldn’t cost taxpayers money.1 of 156 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × The best editorial cartoons of 2013 (so far) View Photos A collection of cartoons from around the country.

Caption A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Tom Toles Wait 1 second to continue.The speed with which the tea party turned on Rubio is stunning beginning earlier this year with complaints from conservative commentators and now open mockery at a Capitol Hill rally. House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) declared this week that the House won’t take up an immigration bill that doesn’t have majority support in the Republican caucus which means the “Gang of Eight” Senate bill that Rubio sponsored wouldn’t get a vote.The immigration event was essentially a bid by the lawmakers to hijack the crowd of about 1000 (respectable if a faint echo of the 2009 and 2010 crowds) that was already assembling at the Capitol on Wednesday for a tea party rally against the IRS on the other side of the building. Calling their event a rally might have been too obvious a theft so the lawmakers staged an all-day “press conference” (which had the benefit of less-stringent permitting requirements).This was a news conference unlike any other. It ran from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (with a two-hour break to minimize overlap with the other rally) began with a prayer included chants of “USA! USA!” and featured politicians holding babies onstage. In the audience a sea of homemade signs announced “Legalized = Invasion” and “The Melting Pot Floweth Over” and “Exporting Illegals = Importing Jobs for Americans” and “God Will Take Care of Them There: Close the Borders.”The few reporters who did pose questions during the extravaganza were cheered or booed based on their employers: an extended ovation for a reporter from the conservative Breitbart News Web site jeers for Lisa Desjardins of CNN and cascading boos for a Huffington Post reporter.The gimmick was a big draw luring so many from the IRS protest that Capitol Police complained of a crowding problem for the supposed news conference. Gohmert rallied opposition to Boehner saying the speaker’s assurances to conservatives on immigration leave room for “a betrayal.”“Get rid of him!” people shouted from the crowd.Bachmann further stirred up the activists by telling them that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) is accelerating a vote on the legislation because of “falling support for the Gang of Eight immigration reform bill.”But the press-conference format and the shortage of reporters willing to play along created an open-mike situation. A man claiming to be from the Pittsburgh tea party asked about “the illegal people” and whether the government could find out “who they’re calling back in their home countries and to whom they’re sending money American money.”Heritage’s Rector fielded that question. “I regard my vote as something like a property right” he said “and when you give it out willy-nilly and freely to people whose claim on that property right is that they broke our laws I feel deeply insulted. And I say ‘You stole from me!’ ”The cheers that followed could be heard clearly on the Senate side of the Capitol.Twitter: @MilbankRead more from Dana Milbank’s archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.',\n",

       " 'Now the immigration debate is really getting juicy.Rep. Steve King an Iowa Republican has always been a bit of a melon head but he outdid himself in an interview that came to light this week in which he described “DREAMers” — people brought to this country illegally as children — as misshapen drug mules. “For every one who’s a valedictorian there’s another 100 out there that — they weigh 130 pounds and they’ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they’re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert” the honorable gentleman said.Cantaloupe calves? This was a rotten tomato tossed at Latinos who were already suspicious of Republicans before the insult was added to the injury of House conservatives such as King blocking action on bipartisan immigration legislation.“Hateful” said House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio).“Inexcusable” said Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.).1 of 171 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Republicans View Photos A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Caption A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Tom Toles Wait 1 second to continue.King kept on throwing. “It’s not something that I’m making up” he told Radio Iowa on Tuesday evening hours after a Democrat who had discovered the recent interview with Newsmax read the offending comments aloud at a congressional hearing. “We have people that are mules that are drug mules that are hauling drugs across the border and you can tell by their physical characteristics what they’ve been doing for months going through the desert with 75 pounds of drugs on their back. And if those who advocate for the DREAM Act if they choose to characterize this about valedictorians I gave them a different image.”King certainly gave his colleagues a different image: that of a Republican Party driven into extinction in coming decades because it antagonized what is becoming the most important voting bloc. Even his usual conservative partners moved to isolate him.“Irresponsible and reprehensible” Rep. Raul Labrador (Idaho) said at a luncheon gathering with reporters called Conversations with Conservatives. “I think what he said was out of touch with the [GOP] conference.”In lieu of a defense of King Labrador scolded the assembled journalists for their reporting on King’s out-of-his-gourd remark but not the favorable things other Republicans say about immigrants. “Shame on you. Shame on the media” he lectured. “Make sure that your article talks about what every Republican said” Labrador proposed “not what one outlier said.”This is similar to scolding the media for focusing on the one plane that crashes and not giving equal attention to all the planes that land safely. More to the point it’s not at all clear that King is such an outlier.Certainly his zany remarks are low-hanging fruit for journalists. Just last week he got into a heated exchange with a Univision host who asked about a speech in which King likened immigrants to a litter of puppies. “You want a good bird dog?” he asked. “Pick the one that’s the friskiest. . . . You get the pick of the litter and you got yourself a pretty good bird dog. Well we’ve got the pick of every donor civilization on the planet.”But if Republicans think King is a fruitcake they don’t show it on the House floor where last month they approved along party lines an amendment King offered that would force the Obama administration to resume deportation of the DREAMers who immigrated as children. “If this position holds no amnesty will reach the president’s desk” the congressman said in a celebratory statement after the vote.1 of 171 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Republicans View Photos A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Caption A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Tom Toles Wait 1 second to continue.And King’s position is holding. Boehner responding to House conservatives is refusing to take up the Senate legislation. Because he has chosen a strategy of passing legislation through the House without Democratic votes the speaker can’t afford to lose more than a handful of Republicans. This empowers “outliers” such as King.“The reason we’re in a bottleneck here in Congress is because of a few like him” Rep. Rubén Hinojosa (D-Tex.) chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus told me Wednesday afternoon at a caucus event outside the Capitol. “Evidently there’s enough to be able to force the speaker of the House to stall and not be able to do this immigration reform.”Republicans say their objections to the immigration bill have nothing to do with racial or ethnic discrimination and that’s surely the case for most of them. But King makes it easy for Democrats to tar the Republicans with sinister motives. Rep. Ben Luján (D-N.M.) one of several speakers denouncing King on the House floor Wednesday said his slur shows why “the American people continue to see House Republicans as out of touch.”That’s not quite fair. But when one of their own is talking about cantaloupe calves Republicans aren’t in a strong position to complain about cherry-picking.Twitter: @MilbankRead more from Dana Milbank’s archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.',\n",

But given that Mexicans in states such as California Arizona and Texas endured Jim Crow-style segregation job discrimination inferior public schools lynchings and hate crimes and repression by racist law enforcement organizations there are similarities.Liberals couldn’t wait to pounce on Young’s remarks spreading the word (literally) and making sure the media knew that – gasp! – a Republican congressman had referred to Mexican immigrants using the w-word. For Democrats who are used to getting Hispanic votes without having to earn them and want to keep it that way by pointing out how bad Republicans are it was like Christmas in springtime.It didn’t help the GOP that Young was clueless about what he done wrong. After the first round of criticism the lawmaker tried to brush off the controversy by saying only that he had “used a term that was commonly used during my days growing up on a farm in Central California” and that he “meant no disrespect.”That’s funny. I grew up around farms in Central California. And I can tell you that term is all about disrespect.After fellow Republicans blasted Young for his comments and demanded that he apologize the congressman swallowed his pride. In a statement Young wrote: “I apologize for the insensitive term I used during an interview in Ketchikan Alaska. There was no malice in my heart or intent to offend; it was a poor choice of words. That word and the negative attitudes that come with it should be left in the 20th century and I’m sorry that this has shifted our focus away from comprehensive immigration reform.”If Young’s comments did shift the focus it wasn’t for long.Over the weekend business groups and organized labor signaled a major breakthrough on the road to comprehensive immigration reform when they announced they had finally struck a deal on guest worker visas a major obstacle. All that remains now is for the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” to unveil their bipartisan legislation by their April 8 deadline.I’m glad to see Republicans jumped on Young for his comments. But where is this outrage when other GOP lawmakers flirt with ethnic demagoguery?And what about Democrats? They were in such a hurry to condemn Young for using the w-word that they missed the fact that they were repeating the word over and over again which suggests either that they’re tone deaf or that they weren’t as offended as they pretended to be.What we learn is that while leadership on matters of race and ethnicity is hard to find in either party political opportunism is alive and well.Let’s face it. Americans are not good when it comes to condemning the loaded language of race and ethnicity. We’re not careful. We’re not consistent. And we’re not sincere. It’s part of an overall breakdown in civility in our society and how dismissive we have become of anyone who raises concern. We’re too mean too childish too petty and too personal.Just look at the shameful way that MSNBC commentator Toure Neblett recently lit into Dr. Ben Carson a pediatric neurosurgeon and black conservative who has been critical of President Barack Obama. Toure all but called Carson an Uncle Tom insisting that this accomplished individual who spoke his mind was Republicans’ token “black friend” because he helps white people “assuage their guilt.”It’s never a good idea for one person of color to assess the authenticity of another – especially if it’s just for ratings.Carson likewise stepped in it when he offered his opinion on gay marriage by drawing comparisons that were harsh and inappropriate.During a recent interview on Fox News Channel he said this: “Well my thoughts are that marriage is between a man and a woman. It’s a well-established fundamental pillar of society and no group be they gays be they NAMBLA be they people who believe in bestiality. It doesn’t matter what they are. They don’t get to change the definition.”Insisting that marriage be defined in a certain way is fine. Equating same-sex marriage with behavior that society has declared deviant and criminal is not.It turns out that elected officials aren’t the only ones who sometimes cross the line with their words and should apologize for it.Follow @CNNOpinion on Twitter.Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion.The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.',\n",
       " 'Every Monday since April thousands of North Carolina residents have gathered at the State Capitol to protest the grotesque damage that a new Republican majority has been doing to a tradition of caring for the least fortunate. Nearly 700 people have been arrested in the “Moral Monday” demonstrations as they are known. But the bad news keeps on coming from the Legislature and pretty soon a single day of the week may not be enough to contain the outrage.In January after the election of Pat McCrory as governor Republicans took control of both the executive and legislative branches for the first time since Reconstruction. Since then state government has become a demolition derby tearing down years of progress in public education tax policy racial equality in the courtroom and access to the ballot.The cruelest decision by lawmakers went into effect last week: ending federal unemployment benefits for 70000 residents. Another 100000 will lose their checks in a few months. Those still receiving benefits will find that they have been cut by a third to a maximum of $350 weekly from $535 and the length of time they can receive benefits has been slashed from 26 weeks to as few as 12 weeks.The state has the fifth-highest unemployment rate in the country and many Republicans insulted workers by blaming their joblessness on generous benefits. In fact though North Carolina is the only state that has lost long-term federal benefits because it did not want to pay back $2.5 billion it owed to Washington for the program. The State Chamber of Commerce argued that cutting weekly benefits would be better than forcing businesses to pay more in taxes to pay off the debt and lawmakers blindly went along dropping out of the federal program.',\n",
       " 'The organization that takes the hardest hit from those who clearly want to distort its message and purpose is the venerable NAACP the oldest of the nation\\'s civil rights organizations.Headlines like \"House freshman calls NAACP chief \\'racist\\' in email\" \"Extremist Hate Group NAACP wants Robert E. Lee’s picture taken down in Florida\" (I\\'m not linking to the hate site that houses this gem) abound and whoever the current head of both the national (currently Benjamin Jealous whose dad is white) or local NAACP groups is at the time they are the target of warped Teapublican poutrages.Other newer organizations like the Southern Poverty Law Center garner their fair share of sewage from both racists and anti-semites alike since they were founded by Morris Dees (who is not Jewish but is attacked as if he is) and Joseph J. Levin Jr.I\\'m a card-carrying member of the NAACP and have always been fascinated by its history.The Birth of the NAACP The Race Riot of 1908 in Abraham Lincoln\\'s hometown of Springfield Illinois had highlighted the urgent need for an effective civil rights organization in the U.S. This event is often cited as the catalyst for the formation of the NAACP. Mary White Ovington journalist William English Walling and Henry Moskowitz met in New York City in January 1909 and the NAACP was born. Solicitations for support went out to more than 60 prominent Americans and a meeting date was set for February 12 1909. This was intended to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the birth of President Abraham Lincoln who emancipated enslaved African Americans. While the meeting did not take place until three months later this date is often cited as the founding date of the organization. The NAACP was founded on February 12 1909 by a diverse group composed of W. E. B. Du Bois Ida B. Wells Archibald Grimké Henry Moskowitz Mary White Ovington Oswald Garrison Villard William English Walling (the last son of a former slave-holding family)Florence Kelley a social reformer and friend of Du Bois and Charles Edward Russell a renowned muckraker and close friend of Walling who helped plan the NAACP and served as acting chairman of the National Negro Committee (1909) a forerunner to the NAACP. On May 30 1909 the Niagara Movement conference took place at New York City\\'s Henry Street Settlement House from which an organization of more than 40 individuals emerged calling itself the National Negro Committee. Du Bois played a key role in organizing the event and presided over the proceedings. Also in attendance was African-American journalist and anti-lynching crusader Ida B. Wells-Barnett. At its second conference on May 30 1910 members chose as the organization\\'s name the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and elected its first officers who were: National President Moorfield Storey BostonChairman of the Executive Committee William English WallingTreasurer John E. Milholland (a Lincoln Republican and Presbyterian from New York)Disbursing Treasurer Oswald Garrison VillardExecutive Secretary Frances BlascoerDirector of Publicity and Research Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois.Much to the surprise of many not familiar with this history many of these founders were white. Though I spent years studying black history with W.E.B. Dubois and Ida Wells-Barnett as two of my favorite subjects it wasn\\'t until later in my studies that I focused on any of the white founders. I\\'ll feature two of them here today.NAACP founding member Mary White OvingtonMary White Ovington was born April 11 1865 in Brooklyn New York. Her parents members of the Unitarian Church were supporters of women\\'s rights and had been involved in anti-slavery movement. Educated at Packer Collegiate Institute and Radcliffe College Ovington became involved in the campaign for civil rights in 1890 after hearing Frederick Douglass speak in a Brooklyn church. In 1895 she helped found the Greenpoint Settlement in Brooklyn. Appointed head of the project the following year Ovington remained until 1904 when she was appointed fellow of the Greenwich House Committee on Social Investigations. Over the next five years she studied employment and housing problems in black Manhattan. During her investigations she met W.E.B. Du Bois and was introduced to the founding members of the Niagara Movement. ...On September 3 1908 she read an article written by Republican William English Walling also a Liberal entitled \"Race War in the North\" in The Independent. Walling described a massive race riot directed at black residents in the hometown of Abraham Lincoln Springfield Illinois that led to seven deaths the destruction of 40 homes and 24 businesses and 107 indictments against rioters. Walling ended the article by calling for a powerful body of citizens to come to the aid of blacks. Ovington responded to the article by writing Walling and meeting at his apartment in New York City along with social worker Dr. Henry Moskowitz. The group decided to launch a campaign by issuing a call for a national conference on the civil and political rights of African-Americans on the centennial of Lincoln’s birthday February 12 1909... After the war Ovington served the NAACP as board member executive secretary and chairman. The NAACP fought a long legal battle against segregation and racial discrimination in housing education employment voting and transportation. They appealed to the Supreme Court to rule that several laws passed by southern states were unconstitutional and won three important judgments between 1915-1923 concerning voting rights and housing...Ovington retired as a board member of the NAACP in 1947 ending 38 years of service with the organization. She died on July 15 1951.William English Walling Chairman of NAACP Executive Committee (1910–1911)William English Walling (1877–1936) (known as \"English\" to friends and family) was an American labor reformer and Socialist Republican born in Louisville Kentucky. He was the grandson of William Hayden English the Democratic candidate for vice president in 1880 and was born into wealth. He was educated at the University of Chicago and at Harvard Law School. He was a co-founder of the NAACP and founded the National Women\\'s Trade Union League in 1903. In 1906 following a trip to Russia to report on the abortive Russian Revolution of 1905 he married Anna Strunsky a Jewish immigrant and an aspiring novelist from San Francisco. In 1908 he published Russia\\'s Message a book inspired by the social unrest he and his wife had observed in Russia. In 1908 Walling and his wife went to Springfield Illinois to investigate a race riot. As a result of their investigations Walling wrote an article The Race War in the North for the September 3 issue of The Independent in which he stated “the spirit of the abolitionists of Lincoln and Lovejoy must be revived and we must come to treat the negro on a plane of absolute political and capitalist equality.” He also appealed for a “large and powerful body of citizens to come to their aid.” The article directly led to the founding of the NAACP.So here we have two staunch anti-racists who helped found an anti-racist organization 104 years ago. Clearly not anti-white. But let\\'s fast forward to today. Though the NAACP does not keep racial demographics for its membership and yes a majority are black Americans NAACP membership is open to all. The current head of the Aiken County South Carolina Branch of the NAACP Phillip Howell  is white. There are also local chapter heads who are Latino.I always find it odd that no one on the right has ever accused me of being \"anti-black\" because of my membership to a whole range of mainly \"white\" organizations over the years from the ACLU to the AARP. In fact no one ever calls them \"white\" groups at all they are just \"groups\" because white is the norm that needs no descriptor in our society one must add an adjective to describe anything else.I\\'ve voted for white presidents and white senators attended mostly white colleges and universities with the exception of Howard University in Washington D.C. Howard due to its history and founding purpose is \"a historically black college\" (HBCU) which of course obfuscates the fact it has over the years graduated white students especially from the medical school during a time when Ivy League med schools had a Jewish quota. Howard was founded by a white man—Oliver O. Howard for whom it is named. I remember having a conversation with Harris Wofford during the time he was the president of SUNY Old Westbury before he became a senator from Pennsylvania. He mentioned having attended Howard Law school.The history of the civil rights movement in this country is one that has been forged out of the activism of people of all backgrounds. I\\'m always surprised when people question me about my former membership in the Black Panther Party assuming it was anti-white simply because of it having \"black\" in the name and its militancy. Yet anyone familiar with the history of the Rainbow Coalition forged by Fred Hampton knows that to be a lie as well.So next time you encounter someone online or in real life spreading faux propaganda about the NAACP or any anti-racist group hit them with the facts.Better still if you are white why not join me in becoming a card-carrying NAACP member. Then you can show them your \"card\" for real.',\n",
       " 'CHICAGO — Mitt Romney is back — and so is his foot.As reported in The Wall Street Journal Romney is planning on re-emerging in ways that will “help shape national priorities” such as assisting the Republican Party as it tries to regain its footing with the non-white voters who ignored the GOP standard-bearer at the polls in 2012.Yes the man known for favoring the term “self-deportation” and offending scores of Hispanics by using the word “illegals” over and over again during prime-time presidential debates wants to give Republicans advice on reaching out to minorities.Romney told the Journal that in addition to wishing his campaign had poured more money into ads targeting Hispanic voters the GOP needs “to translate our message in a way that minorities understand.”Honestly of all the slips Romney committed during last year’s campaign — from letting his staffers tell Spanish-language media that he was struggling with Latinos because they were simply not well-informed to never calling out his fellow Republicans for using degrading language when speaking about immigrants or Hispanics — this latest is probably the most insulting.1 of 171 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Republicans View Photos A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Caption A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Tom Toles Wait 1 second to continue.Some Latino advocates spent the year leading up to the election painting him as a racist for not compromising on his views toward illegal immigration. But I always thought his biggest failure as a candidate was his inability to connect with people who aren’t rich and privileged. His terrible tone-deafness for non-whites was a close second.Let’s unpack his recent comment starting with the tricky loaded word “translate.” My first impression was that Romney used the word because he like so many others still believes that most Hispanics can’t speak English.Can someone please get this man on the Pew Hispanic Center’s email list? Almost two-thirds of Hispanics report speaking only English or speaking it very well according to the nonpartisan research organization.That sounds touchy you say? Well what else could he have meant? The GOP’s 2012 platform said the party wanted to “rebuild the economy and create jobs reform government to serve the people and build healthy families great schools and safe neighborhoods.” These concepts don’t need to be broken down into some simplified code so minorities can make sense of them.And this is the second hot button Romney’s statement pushes. Did he not hear about how a leading Republican think tank the Heritage Foundation ticked off Latinos when it became known that an anti-immigration reform study was co-authored by a researcher who had authored a Harvard Ph.D. dissertation contending Hispanics have particularly low IQs?A mere month after that deeply offensive controversy is not the time to imply that minorities have a hard time comprehending the basic tenets of an organization’s values and need special help to understand.Actually it’s Republicans such as Phyllis Schlafly and Pat Buchanan — who have suggested that what the GOP really needs is to double-down on white voters and lamented that “white folks are losing interest in politics and voting” — who need someone to translate for them.Ann Telnaes animation: Ann Romney reflects on her husband’s election defeat. (Ann Telnaes/The Washington Post)Schlafly Buchanan and others who find it silly that some Republicans think immigration reform will send Latino voters into the arms of the GOP aren’t wrong to be skeptical about such a proposition. It’s a long shot at best and Republicans are better off banking on the fact that Latinos care more about education the economy health care and the federal budget deficit than immigration.But Hispanics as with all minority voters do care greatly about being treated with respect which is exactly the top concern that the Republican National Committee outlined in their December 2012 treatise “The Growth and Opportunity Project.”In plain English it calls on the Republican Party to “stop talking to itself” change the “perception that the GOP does not care about people” and begin to “engage [ethnic minority voters] and show our sincerity.”As the RNC points out America now looks different and the GOP simply needs to deal with it in a civil manner. The report quotes tea party leader Dick Armey on the topic of tone: “You can’t call someone ugly and expect them to go to the prom with you.”See? That’s great advice. And here’s some for Romney: If you want to help the Republicans with their Hispanic and minority outreach just write some checks and stay out of earshot.Follow Esther Cepeda on Twitter @estherjcepeda.',\n",

       " 'How often do the mainstream media misinform or outright lie? How many of them apologize or correct the record for the misinformation and lies? How often do they research and correct the political points they were forced to air from politicians and political operatives?Currently the mainstream media are scolding the Obama administration for lack of access and for using other types of media (social media and local media) to get their information out directly. They insinuate the behavior is tantamount to state run media.Maybe if the mainstream media behaved as Jon Stewart in the video below the administration would be less reticent. It is refreshing to watch Stewart who realizes that inasmuch as he is a satirist he should apologize and correct the record when he wrongly maligns someone.Last week he did a skit on Mississippi taking 148 years to ratify the 13th amendment the amendment that abolished slavery. He implied that the former Mississippi secretary of state Dick Molpus who presided over a 1995 attempt to ratify the 13th amendment may have been a casual bigot. It turned outDick Molpus had a long and distinguished record for speaking out for Civil Rights.He led charge on voting rights reform.In 1989 he spoke at the 25th year anniversary of the three kids killed in Mississippi during the Civil Right conflicts for which he received death threats.What is telling is no one called the Jon Stewart show to ask him to correct the record. He did it out of duty. One can only hope that in the long run the mainstream media will be forced to act accordingly. They have yet to apologize for all the misinformation that they have put out from the buildup to the war in Iraq to the misinformation about the Affordable Care Act.

       " 'With budgetary tantrums in the Senate and investigative play-acting in the House the Republican Party is proving once again that it simply cannot be taken seriously.This is a shame. I don’t share the GOP’s philosophy but I do believe that competition makes both of our major parties smarter. I also believe that a big complicated country facing economic and geopolitical challenges needs a government able to govern.What we don’t need is the steady diet of obstruction diversion and gamesmanship that Republicans are trying to ram down the nation’s throat. It’s not as if President Obama and the Democrats are doing everything right. It’s just that the GOP shrinks from doing anything meaningful at all.The most glaring example at the moment is in the Senate. For four years Republican senators lambasted their Democratic colleagues — with justification — for not approving a budget one of the basic tasks of governance. Sen. John Cornyn(R-Tex.) and others regularly took to the Senate floor to announce the number of days since the body last produced a spending plan and to blast Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) for this shocking failure.Two months ago Reid and the Democrats finally passed a budget. Since the House has already passed its version — the controversial plan authored by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) — the next step should be for both chambers to appoint members of a conference committee that would iron out the differences. But Republicans won’t let this happen.1 of 171 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Republicans View Photos A collection of cartoons about the GOP.

Establishment types such as John McCain of Arizona are apoplectic at the antics of their tea party-inspired colleagues which McCain called “absolutely out of line and unprecedented.”Cruz and the others are worried that a conference committee might not only work out a budget but also make it possible to raise the federal debt ceiling without the now-customary showdown threatening default and catastrophe.

According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office the deficit is shrinking rapidly and will fall to $642 billion this fiscal year. That’s still substantial but it’s less than half the deficit our government ran in 2011. More important if annual deficits continue to decline as the CBO predicts the long-term debt problem begins to look more manageable. That’s good news right?What Republicans ought to do is declare a victory for fiscal conservatism and move on to the battle to have their priorities reflected in the budget — a promising fight since the conferees appointed by the GOP-controlled House are hardly going to be flaming liberals. Instead the party seeks not consensus but crisis.This is no way for a 2-year-old to act much less the self-proclaimed “world’s greatest deliberative body.”And speaking of juvenile behavior I would be remiss not to mention how Rep.

But instead House Republicans summon the television cameras and ask round after round of tendentious questions — without paying the slightest attention to the answers.Similarly on the question of how and why the IRS gave added scrutiny to conservative “social welfare” groups seeking nonprofit status House inquisitors seem barely interested in what actually happened. “What did the president know and when did he know it?” was an appropriate question. But the follow-up — “Harrumph well then why didn’t he know sooner?” — isn’t much in the way of scandal material.And concerning the Justice Department’s overzealous crusade to thwart classified leaks — and investigative reporting — it is amusing to watch House Republicans twist themselves into champions of the hated Lamestream Media.

       " 'WASHINGTON -- On election night in Chicago two months ago President Barack Obama triumphantly pledged to fight for a middle class he\\'d appealed to relentlessly -- and successfully -- on the 2012 campaign trail.\"I believe we can build on the progress we\\'ve made and continue to fight for new jobs and new opportunity and new security for the middle class\" Obama said. \"I believe we can keep the promise of our founders the idea that if you\\'re willing to work hard ... you can make it here in America.\"The central challenge of Obama\\'s second term is whether he can keep that founder’s \"promise\" to working Americans. It won\\'t be easy and in an era of divided government and amid cries for austerity and budget cuts it does not seem likely that the president will offer sweeping new proposals to do so. The administration has said that its top two priorities at the outset of its second term are immigration reform and gun control. Despite an ongoing jobs crisis creating quality jobs seems to have fallen a few slots on the president\\'s to-do list.As Obama implicitly acknowledged the American middle class has fallen on hard times saddled with historic levels of debt skyrocketing health care costs and flat wages. By most accounts middle-class Americans are no better off than they were when the president took office in 2009 in the wake of an unprecedented financial crisis and in the midst of the Great Recession.The arithmetic is stark. Median household income is lower than when Obama took office according to Census Bureau data -- lower even than when President Bill Clinton left office in 2001. The middle 60 percent of households -- those earning between $20262 and $101582 -- captured a smaller share of aggregate income in 2011 than they did in 2009 while the top fifth which already made more than the other groups combined captured more. Surveys of public opinion reveal a middle class that is smaller poorer and less optimistic than ever. And although the unemployment rate fitfully has fallen below 8 percent for the first time since Obama\\'s 2009 inauguration most new jobs are too low-paying to sustain middle-class families.There is more to the plight of the American middle class than numbers can express -- and a greater threat to the country than economists can quantify.Democracy after all can\\'t thrive without a broad strong educated core of citizens. But today they find themselves buffeted by the remorseless dictates of global capital the need for evermore education and training and the burdens of higher taxes to pay for social programs they need such as health care.Battling these global and cultural trends is difficult. In fact it is unfair to ask any one person -- even a president even Barack Obama -- to overcome them all. The president’s first responsibility in 2009 literally was to do his part to save the world’s frozen capital banking and trade systems -- without which the American middle class would have had no prospects at all.Most fair-minded observers would say that Obama did his part and acquitted himself well under crushing circumstances. A workable and affordable health care system the central legislative success of his first term can (if he sets it up properly) be of great benefit to middle-class workers.But now he must make good on his own promise -- not always central to his discourse or decision making -- to find more good-paying middle class jobs.How?On the stump this year the president made manufacturing a centerpiece of his vision arguing that a combination of tax reform investment and education could help repatriate quality jobs to U.S. soil and stabilize the middle class. Perhaps sensing the political popularity of such an idea in Rust Belt states like Ohio and Michigan the Obama campaign set the lofty but achievable goal of creating a million new manufacturing jobs during the president\\'s second term.In a recent interview on \"Meet the Press\" the president renewed his commitment to investing in infrastructure which he called \"broken\" as another way to create good-paying jobs.With the conversation in Washington focused not just on austerity but how much austerity to apply to a sputtering economy it\\'s hard to imagine what kind of rebooted jobs plan the president could propose for his next term while staying within the bounds of political reality.\"In the short term we are in a pretty difficult spot\" said John Schmitt an economist with the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research who studies economic inequality and unemployment. \"Even if there was a serious commitment on the part of the administration towards a jobs program of some sort it would run into a lot of trouble in the Congress.\"Without a clear and politically viable policy objective for jobs -- unlike say banning high-capacity magazines to address mass shootings -- the administration is likely to continue the piecemeal approach to economic recovery that it took for most of the president\\'s first term observers say.Obama\\'s landmark 2009 stimulus bill pumped billions of dollars into the ailing economy stemming the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs each month. The bill addressed the short-term fallout in the private sector by cutting taxes and pouring money into infrastructure projects and expanded unemployment insurance benefits.But since then additional spending has been all but off the table. Obama has repeatedly proposed more infrastructure spending but the White House has routinely given up such demands in negotiations with congressional Republicans.The lack of stimulus since the initial package -- aside from the repeated extensions of long-term unemployment insurance -- has exasperated left-leaning and centrist economists.\"The answer is very clear: We need substantial additional stimulus to support the economy\" said Heidi Shierholz an economist at the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) a left-of-center think tank. \"We are choosing as a country and as a town [Washington] not to do it with millions of jobless workers.\"To address the decline in manufacturing jobs the Obama administration has undertaken a number of modest initiatives such as launching a manufacturing institute in Youngstown Ohio with $30 million in federal funding a joint effort between industry and schools to train workers for tomorrow\\'s manufacturing jobs. The Youngstown facility focuses on training workers for 3-D printing technology the kind of modern manufacturing industry where observers see a lot of potential.The facility is an acknowledgment that tomorrow\\'s manufacturing jobs will be different from the ones of the past. Gone are the days when a new high school graduate could show up at the factory door get trained on the shop floor and earn a good wage and a pension. Jobs like those in 3-D printing require more advanced training and a certain degree of computer literacy. The same goes for other areas where experts as well as the White House see promise like industrial robotics or nanomanufacturing. Obama\\'s own tech advisers have warned that the country\\'s \"historic leadership\" in manufacturing technology is \"at risk\" if it can\\'t cultivate the right talent for these fields.In his 2013 budget proposal Obama called for devoting $1 billion to create a national network of institutes like the one in Youngstown -- a recommendation that hasn\\'t exactly become a priority for Congress. Neither have the loftier goals of his earlier manufacturing package such as extending tax breaks to companies that return jobs to U.S. shores. They appear unlikely to move forward in a second term even if the president chooses to champion them.\"The administration has done some things but could do a lot more to help manufacturing\" said Scott Paul director of the non-profit Alliance for American Manufacturing. What the White House has done so far is \"not well-publicized or well-known. They will ultimately be helpful but so much of the debate has become politicized it\\'s hard to make progress on some of the meaningful issues.\"And in the end the manufacturing plan still faces some cold mathematics. The U.S. lost more than 5 million manufacturing jobs in the first decade of this century falling from 17 million to 12 million. Fewer than 9 percent of American workers have manufacturing jobs compared with more than 20 percent in 1979. Creating a million new such jobs puts only a dent in that sector\\'s -- and the middle class\\'s -- long-term woes.\"It doesn\\'t come close to restoring manufacturing employment to what it had been\" Paul noted adding that he still found the goal admirable.Even setting aside the immediate joblessness crisis Obama still faces the long-term problems of deteriorating wages and growing income inequality for the poor and middle class. Since 1979 the top 1 percent of American households captured more than 38 percent of income growth while the bottom 90 percent received just shy of 37 percent according to EPI.The Great Recession technically ended halfway through 2009 but the economic recovery of the past few years is replacing office workers real estate brokers and insurance claims adjusters with retail salespeople restaurant workers and warehouse hands.Mid-wage jobs -- ones with median hourly wages ranging from $13.84 to $21.13 -- accounted for 60 percent of the jobs lost during the recession according to an analysis by the National Employment Law Project a worker advocacy group. During the recovery since then mid-wage jobs have represented just 22 percent of growth. Jobs earning less than $13.84 per hour made up 58 percent of recovery growth according to the NELP.The president pledged during his 2008 campaign that by 2011 he would have the minimum wage raised to $9.50 and pegged to inflation a move that worker advocates have clamored for for years claiming it would help raise the wage floor for the working poor and the middle class. But the federal minimum wage remains $7.25 per hour well below a living wage in most areas.Many of those same worker advocates tie the stagnation of real wages to the decline of collective bargaining in the workplace. The rate of unionization in the U.S. has fallen to a historic low with just 7 percent of private-sector workers now belonging to a union. Labor leaders believe that labor law needs to be amended to make it easier for workers to join unions. Their best shot came and went under the president\\'s watch when Democrats failed to pass the Employee Free Choice Act when they controlled both chambers of Congress.\"I do feel disappointment\" said Schmitt the Center for Economic and Policy Research economist. \"That said we\\'re also in a [political] context where it\\'s extremely difficult to make any progress on the concerns of low- and middle-wage workers.\"Despite those shortcomings and despite the acrimony on Capitol Hill liberals like Richard Trumka president of the AFL-CIO federation of unions are bullish on Obama\\'s second term given the focus on the middle class and jobs during the election.\"It all starts with the political will or the national appetite to again create jobs that are going to be family-supportive and middle-class producing and I think that\\'s underway right now\" Trumka said. \"People are talking about it. That\\'s the difference between this election and the ones in the past. We actually had a debate about what\\'s hollowing out the country and what isn\\'t. And our side won big time.\"Now the president’s challenge is to turn that political victory into an economic one for the people who supported him.This article is part of a series produced by The Huffington Post that closely examines the most pressing challenges facing President Obama in his second term.

Things like reminding us about the 57 states gaffe? (The irony of Gaffemaster Palin bringing up this incident is rich).It got us scandals! Scandals I tellz ya!So it's all John McCain and his brainiacs fault. If Sarah Palin had just been allowed to speak the truth if only Americans knew Barack Obama had visited Bill Ayers in 57 states she and McCain could have won that election!Probably the one right thing John McCain did after the historic error of selecting Sarah Palin half-term governor of Alaska as his running mate was muzzling her immediately. She most likely was told not to talk about anything at all really. Thank you once again John McCain for giving us Sarah Palin in 2008 and thus Barack Obama.\",\n",
       " 'SCOTTSDALE Ariz. — The Democratic National Committee’s summer meeting here late last week was starkly different from the gathering of its Republican counterparts earlier in the month. There were no surefire news-making speakers like Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey or former Speaker Newt Gingrich nor was there consideration of any made-for-cable-news resolutions like one that tried to bar a pair of television networks from sponsoring future presidential debates.Rather it was a sedate gathering where routine party business was conducted routinely by national and state Democratic officials in a suburban Phoenix resort.But when Harold M. Ickes walked into the Rules and Bylaws Committee meeting on Thursday afternoon and rejoined the panel at least one longtime Democratic strategist raised her eyebrows.“He predated the Clinton era but when I saw Harold reappointed to the D.N.C. he surely in my judgment symbolizes the return of the Clintons” said Donna Brazile a fellow member of the rules committee.Mr. Ickes said he was put back on the committee by Debbie Wasserman Schultz chairwoman of the national committee and herself an ardent advocate for Mrs. Clinton in 2008 but he also acknowledged that he “actively sought” the seat.“It is in my view the most important committee at the D.N.C. because of its role in shaping the nomination process” he said adding a bit mischievously “The goal is to design rules to nominate the strongest candidate for the general election.”That he added would be up to the voters but there is no question who he believes that candidate is.Mr. Ickes 73 is a fixture in the Clinton’s world. He ran Bill Clinton’s New York campaign in the 1992 Democratic primary and served as a deputy chief of staff in Mr. Clinton’s White House. He was a top adviser to Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign and Mrs. Clinton’s chief liaison at the D.N.C. during her primary battle against Barack Obama. From his perch on the rules committee he memorably railed against a compromise on disputed delegates in the waning days of the Democratic primary.At a notably less sedate national committee meeting in late May 2008 Mr. Ickes argued in vain against what he called the “hijacking” of Mrs. Clinton’s delegate share from two disputed state primaries. “I am stunned that we have the gall and the chutzpah to substitute our judgment for 600000 voters” Mr. Ickes said at the time.A few weeks later Mrs. Clinton conceded the race to Mr. Obama. The following year with Mr. Obama as party leader Mr. Ickes left his rules committee post. According to party records he had served on the rules panel since at least 1992.“I was not reappointed after the 2008 election for some pretty obvious reasons” Mr. Ickes said.Now five years later — with Mr. Obama a lame duck and speculation soaring about whether Mrs. Clinton will seek the White House again — her procedural maven is back in his old position at the national party. The rules committee is tasked with setting the guidelines governing the presidential nominating process.Mrs. Clinton does not lack for support among national committee members — that much was obvious by the rate in which unofficial campaign buttons promoting her for 2016 were sold in the hallway outside the conference room here.But with Mr. Ickes a canny tactician with decades of presidential campaign experience again on the rules committee she has a strategist on a key committee who could advocate for her interest.As one party official put it Mr. Ickes not only knows how the party works but effectively “wrote the rules” for the national committee over the years at least until he was thwarted by Mr. Obama.Mr. Ickes said he did not rejoin the committee at the behest of either Mr. or Mrs. Clinton but conceded that he understood the meaning of his reappearance as Democrats begin to consider life after Mr. Obama.“I was on the rules committee for years and years but yes I can understand people reading it that way” he said.',\n",
       " 'But all told a critical look at some of the activities of those tea party applicants currently under review by IREHR or those already designated as 501(C)(4) reveals the potential for a threat to democratic governance in general.From the IREHR website: The Tea Party and the IRS “Scandal” The Actual Facts of the CaseHere are the not-so-known facts of a few of those cases:• The First Coast Tea Party Inc. of Jacksonville Florida for example which applied for 501(c)(4) status in 2009 and received it in 2011. Commenting about the recent IRS controversy on Facebook the group declared “We file a tax return account for every penny.. We do not endorse candidates that is a no no.” Yet the group’s activities included public bragging about directly helping Republican campaigns. In an August 30 2012 Facebook post for instance the group advertised a Jacksonville rally for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan adding “bring your chairs and your signs make sure they know that the First Coast Tea Party is and has been helping their campaign.”It must be noted here that three weeks after receiving 501(C)(4) status the group declared a \"state of emergency\" on their Facebook page pleading with supporters to campaign for Romney.THIS is just one example of why the IRS wanted all their Facebook postings.“FLORIDA FRIENDS IF YOU LIVE IN ANY OF THESE 3 COUNTIES GET OFF THE COUCH NOW GET YOUR FRIENDS OFF THE COUCH. GET TO THE REPUBLICAN HEADQUARTERS AND OFFER AND THEN DO SOME WORK. PHONES (YOU CAN EVEN DO THESE CALLS FROM HOME) AND WALK AND KNOCK. NOW. WE CANNOT LOSE FLORIDA TO OBAMA.. NOW. THIS IS MOST CRITICAL.” [Emphasis in Original]That plea came from the official Face book account of the organization as opposed to coming from random supporters.• Similarly the Louisville Tea Party was granted 501(c)(4) status in 2009. Nevertheless it published a list of “officially tea party endorsed candidates for the 2011 Kentucky primary.” They also published an article “The Rationale for Romney-Ryan” arguing for Tea Partiers to vote for the Republican candidate.Then there’s...• The Katy Tea Party Patriots which filed for 501(c)(4) non-profit status in 2009. This group actually ran an “Oust Obama 2012” campaign organizing block-watching with the Fort Bend GOP and phone-banking against Obama at GOP headquarters in Sugarland and Houston Texas. Still featured on the frontpage of the group’s website at the time this article was written is an October 4 2012 article entitled “Our Country\\'s Future” by Katy Tea Party Patriots President Darcy Kahrhoff. She urged members to vote for Gov. Romney. \"Please take time to talk with friends and family you may have living out of state and try to convince them to vote for Governor Romney especially if you have friends and family in Florida Colorado or Ohio. Also find a Senatorial candidate to support in these states and go to FreedomWorks to phone bank for these patriots. Everything you can do to help will matter. We can and we must win this!\"Not to be outdone...• The Central Valley Tea Party Inc. This regional California Tea Party group was granted the much more politically limiting IRS 501(c)(3) tax status back in 2009. It should be noted that this tax-status explicitly prohibits partisan political activity. According the IRS “Under the Internal Revenue Code all section 501(c)(3) organizations are absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in or intervening in any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office. The prohibition applies to all campaigns including campaigns at the federal state and local level. Violation of this prohibition may result in denial or revocation of tax-exempt status and the imposition of certain excise taxes.”Despite this (c)(3) designation the front-page of the group\\'s website features \"upcoming events\" instructing members to \"Volunteer for Measure G\" and \"Volunteer for Vidak for Senate.” In the latter case the website simply tells members...\"Please volunteer to do phone banking or precinct walking to help win the election.\"\"So it’s time to get excited to vote for the better candidate. It’s time to talk him up to friends and family. It’s time to join with groups like Operation Swing State (www.operationswingstate.org) and make calls in support of his candidacy.\"In an article in the October 2012 issue of the Central Valley Tea Party Times entitledPaul Szopa told fellow Central Valley Tea Partiers to get out and campaign for GOP presidential candidate Mitt RomneyAnother Tea Party group granted the 501(c)(3) non-profit status by the IRS...• The Tifton Georgia-based Tiftarea Tea Party Patriots Inc. which received the designation in 2010. The group also appears to have engaged in openly political activity including publicly endorsing candidates. On October 9 2012 in a post on the group’s website “Are you ready to vote?” the group offered up an endorsement for Romney “The choice is simple. Obama has stated He will transform America and acted to do such. Everything this Administration stands for is Government and control of every aspect of life. This is the pipe dream of a Socialist’s mentality for in their eyes you the individual do not know and cannot do what is right so someone else has to make decisions for you to ensure you do not make the wrong choices or actions. Or you chose Romney who does not want to transform America the greatest nation in history of human kind. He wants to allow the individual to have the right to succeed and fail on his own regard while ensuring those freedoms given by our Creator and to assure those inalienable rights written about in the Declaration of Independence are retained by their proper owners ‘We the People.’”Note these are only a few of the many examples of blatant political involvement by tea party \\'non-profits\\' reviewed by IREHR. Of course there are plenty more. As the title of this diary indicates the REAL scandal here is how often the IRS granted 501(C)(4) status to groups that egregiously violated standards.Even though the agency was clearly inundated with applications there\\'s no excuse for the incompetency of its employees. As far as I know the agency was at full strength; no cutbacks no furloughs... just incompetency.Now one must ask:After the firing of several high level IRS employees over this incident how likely is it that Tea Party groups will be prevented these sorts of violations in the future?I don\\'t know if we want to know the answer to that question.Here\\'s an article written for Salon.com by Joan Walsh highlighting what appears to be one of the few groups denied 501(C)(4) status -- a Democratic group.',\n",
       " '7 years agoWashington (CNN) - What a difference a month makes.A new CNN/ORC International poll indicates a dramatic turnaround in the battle for control of Congress in next year\\'s midterm elections.Democrats a month ago held a 50%-42% advantage among registered voters in a generic ballot which asked respondents to choose between a Democrat or Republican in their congressional district without identifying the candidates.That result came after congressional Republicans appeared to overplay their hand in the bitter fight over the federal government shutdown and the debt ceiling.But the Democratic lead has disappeared. A new CNN/ORC poll indicates the GOP now holds a 49%-47% edge.The new survey was conducted last week and released Tuesday.The 10-point swing follows a political uproar over Obamacare which included the botched rollout of HealthCare.gov and controversy over insurance policy cancelations due primarily to the new health law.The turnaround in the CNN/ORC poll follows similar shifts in recent national surveys from Quinnipiac University and Fox News.At a news conference two weeks ago President Barack Obama acknowledged that problems plaguing the startup of the new healthcare law could hurt Democrats.\"There is no doubt that our failure to rollout the ACA smoothly has put a burden on Democrats whether they are running or not because they stood up and supported this effort through thick and thin\" Obama said.The CNN/ORC poll released as the President makes a West Coast campaign fundraising swing on behalf of fellow Democrats indicates both parties making gains within their base.\"It looks like the biggest shifts toward the Republicans came among white voters higher-income Americans and people who live in rural areas while Democrats have gained strength in the past month among some of their natural constituencies such as non-white voters and lower-income Americans\" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.\"If those patterns persist into 2014 it may indicate that Obamacare is popular among those who it was designed to help the most but unpopular among the larger group of voters who are personally less concerned about health insurance and health care\" Holland said.Republicans currently have a 17-seat advantage in the U.S. House with the Democrats holding a 55-45 majority in the Senate.While the generic ballot question is one of the most commonly used indicators when it comes to the battle for Congress the poll results are a long way from predicting what will happen next November.\"There is just under a year to go before any votes are actually cast and the \\'generic ballot\\' question is not necessarily a good predictor of the actual outcome of 435 separate elections\" Holland cautions.\"A year before the 2010 midterms for example the Democrats held a six-point lead on the generic ballot but the GOP wound up regaining control of the House in that election cycle thanks to an historic 63-seat pickup\" he said.The poll was conducted November 18-20 for CNN by ORC International with 843 adult Americans including 749 registered voters questioned by telephone. The survey\\'s overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.',\n",
       " 'The FEC wrote Pasley in February to ask why the campaign had not filed a year-end report for 2012 and in May to ask why it skipped a first-quarter 2013 report. The letters cautioned that failure to file could result in a civil money penalty audit or legal enforcement action.',\n",

       " 'There\\'s an irony in the Internal Revenue Service\\'s crackdown on conservative groups.The nation\\'s tax agency has admitted to inappropriately scrutinizing smaller tea party organizations that applied for tax-exempt status and senior Treasury Department officials were notified in the midst of the 2012 presidential election season that an internal investigation was underway. But the IRS largely maintained a hands-off policy with the much larger big-budget organizations on the left and right that were most influential in the elections and are organized under a section of the tax code that allows them to hide their donors.\"The IRS goes AWOL when wealthy and powerful forces want to break the law in order to hide their wrongful efforts and secret political influence\" said Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse a Democrat who is among a small Senate group pushing campaign finance reform measures that would force these big outside groups to disclose their donors. \"Picking on the little guy is a pretty lousy thing to do.\"Karl Rove\\'s Crossroads GPS and the Koch brothers\\' Americans for Prosperity were among those that spent tens of millions of dollars on TV ads and get-out-the-vote efforts to help Republicans. Democrats were aided in similar fashion by Priorities USA made up of former Barack Obama campaign aides and American Bridge 21st Century Foundation an opposition research group led by a former adviser to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.And yet those groups so far have escaped investigations into whether they have crossed the blurry line under the law between what constitutes a tax-exempt \"social welfare\" organization that is free from donor reporting requirements and a political committee subject to taxes and disclosures.Watchdog groups and lawmakers who have sought more disclosure and restrictions on such groups claim an injustice. They say the IRS saga over the targeting of smaller groups shines a bright light onto the agency\\'s failure to guard against the flood of secret money into the political system through the creation of the deep-pocketed groups.Yet other advocates of reform worry that in light of the IRS disclosure of targeting small groups government regulators will be less likely to scrutinize the tax-exempt status of the bigger more powerful groups out of fear that they will appear to be targeting groups for political reasons.\"We expect that opponents of disclosure will try to use the recent developments to allow the groups that are misusing the tax laws to hide donors to continue misusing them. But that\\'s a battle that we will engage in\" said Fred Wertheimer founder and president of watchdog group Democracy 21.Since a series of court decisions including the Supreme Court\\'s ruling in the 2010 Citizens United case the IRS has seen an influx of applications -- from 1735 in 2010 to 3357 in 2012 -- by so-called social welfare groups wanting to form under section 501(c)(4) of the federal tax code. That section grants tax-exempt status as long as the primary mission of these organizations is not politics and influencing elections. The IRS makes that determination. Such nonprofits can keep secret the names of their donors which are not subject to traditional campaign finance limits.The rules are fuzzy. The law says that these groups can only be involved in social welfare activity and not politics. But IRS regulations give the groups leeway to conduct political activities -- as long as that is not its \"primary activity.\" That conflict opens the door to potential abuses and different interpretations of what is allowed and what is prohibited.An IRS inspector general\\'s report released this week recommended developing for the first time specific guidelines to measure the primary activity of social welfare organizations and some in Congress have shown a willingness to review big groups like the nonprofit Crossroads GPS and its sister super PAC American Crossroads. They spent a combined $176 million in the last election cycle much of it on television advertisements to benefit Republican candidates.A Senate investigative panel led by Democrat Carl Levin of Michigan and Republican John McCain of Arizona has been reviewing the use of social welfare groups for political causes for the past year and now is examining the agency\\'s handling of the tax-exempt reviews.And in a letter to congressional investigators Thursday Rep. Chris Van Hollen D-Md. urged the House Ways and Means Committee not to ignore the influx of groups that may be abusing the tax code as part of its upcoming IRS probe saying: \"I hope we can remove the incentive for any group regardless of its political orientation to seek 501(c)(4) tax-exempt status to engage in significant political campaign activities while hiding their donors.\"Despite the bipartisan outcry over the IRS scandal there\\'s little incentive for lawmakers on either side of the aisle to push for reforms because Republicans and Democrats alike benefit from these big outside groups.In fact just the opposite may be happening.Some congressional Democrats fearful of being tied to the scandal are backing the push for more aggressive enforcement of these groups. And some conservative leaders and Republican donors are using the IRS scandal to help protect the status quo while preparing to pump hundreds of millions of dollars -- raised anonymously in many cases with no contribution limits -- into the next election cycle just as they did last fall.\"I would hope that this new information about the politicization of the IRS should put the brakes on any sort of disclosure of donors who wish to remain anonymous\" said Charlie Spies who helps raise money for several conservative organizations and previously led the super political action committee that raised more than $140 million to benefit Mitt Romney\\'s presidential bid. \"We\\'re now seeing exactly what the risk is for donors to be disclosed.\"At least some tea party groups are unwilling to trust the agency with more enforcement power in the wake of such damaging revelations.\"The IRS\\' integrity is shattered\" said Jenny Beth Martin chairman of the Tea Party Patriots which was among the largest nonprofit conservative groups the IRS targeted. She said that now more than ever donors need freedom to give money anonymously \"without fear of retribution\" from a politicized IRS. In the meantime she says her organization\\'s influence is growing fueled by anonymous unlimited donations.Wertheimer of Democracy 21 said the \"laundering of secret money into elections\" will become a greater scandal than IRS misconduct unless something is done.\"There will be efforts to sweep this under the rug\" he said. \"They may succeed on a temporary basis for a relatively short period but they are not going to succeed in the long term.\"',\n",

       " \"Story highlights Senior officials say Biden apologized to Obama on Wednesday Obama responded that Biden was speaking from the heart they say Biden's weekend remarks spurred Obama to announce his support for same-sex marriage(CNN) —Vice President Joe Biden has apologized to President Barack Obama for putting him in a tough position that led to Obama’s announcement that he now supports same-sex marriage senior administration officials said Thursday.Obama said in an interview that aired Thursday on ABC that he made his decision public earlier than he had planned after Biden’s weekend remark that he was “absolutely comfortable” with letting gays and lesbians marry.Two senior administration officials said Biden and Obama met Wednesday morning and Biden apologized for putting Obama in a tough spot. Obama responded by saying that he knew Biden was speaking from the heart said the officials who didn’t want to be named discussing private conversations between the president and vice president.Biden’s remarks on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday launched a controversy that led to Obama announcing that his position on same-sex marriage which he had previously called “evolving” had shifted to support. When Obama’s full interview aired Thursday he said his disclosure came sooner than planned as a result of Biden’s comments.“I had already made a decision that we were going to probably take this position before the election and before the convention” Obama said on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” Biden “probably got out a little bit over his skis but out of generosity of spirit” he said.He added that he would have “preferred to have done this in my own way on my own terms” but “all’s well that ends well.”Separately Biden spokeswoman Kendra Barkoff said Obama “has been the leader on this issue from day one and the vice president never intended to distract from that.”Once Biden’s comments drew attention to the issue Obama made plans to announce his support next week on a previously scheduled appearance on the ABC talk show “The View” a senior administration official said Thursday. The president and his advisers knew Obama would be asked about the issue in the wake of Biden’s NBC interview said the official who didn’t want to speak publicly about internal administration discussions.Ultimately they decided to move up the timeline and have him announce his support during the ABC interview at the White House the official said. And a top Democrat told CNN that Obama knew the issue would come up at the convention partly because of a push for support for same-sex marriage to be included in the Democratic Party platform and in debates.Multiple top Democrats told CNN the president’s senior aides are annoyed with Biden for forcing the conversation on same-sex marriage now. One source said Biden has in the past counseled the president against coming out for same-sex marriage making this move that much more frustrating.But the sources said they don’t believe it will create a lasting rift between the two leaders. Biden is known to go off-script something Obama knew when he selected his vice president.In explaining to ABC how his position has evolved Obama noted that his daughters Malia and Sasha have “friends whose parents are same-sex couples. It wouldn’t dawn on them that somehow their friends’ parents would be treated differently. And frankly that’s the kind of thing that prompts a change of perspective not wanting to somehow explain to your child why somebody should be treated differently when it comes to the eyes of the law.”Asked about whether his new position is a calculated move in an election year Obama said it would “be hard to argue that somehow this is something that I’d be doing for political advantage. Because frankly you know the politics – it’s not clear how they cut.”The interview aired the same day Obama attended a fundraiser in Los Angeles where support for same-sex marriage is strong. Movie star George Clooney hosted the event which is raking in $15 million according to a top Democratic source. And on Monday openly gay singer Ricky Martin is hosting a fundraising event for Obama in New York.But some in the African-American community have expressed strong disapproval of Obama’s endorsement of same-sex marriage. A Democratic official said the White House has been actively reaching out to African-American community leaders and pastors and will continue to do so in the wake of the president’s decision but the official noted that even the president’s base won’t always agree with him on everything. “There are going to be issues you don’t agree on” the official said.And Obama told ABC he won’t spend much time talking about the issue because he’s focused on the economy. The announcement puts Obama squarely at odds with presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney who has since reiterated his opposition to same-sex marriage.“And I do not favor civil unions if they are identical to marriage other than by name” Romney said during a Wednesday visit to Fort Lupton Colorado. “My view is the domestic partnership benefits hospital visitation rights and the like are appropriate but that the others are not.”The issue is a divisive one in American politics but it’s uncertain how the development might play out at the voting booth.A Gallup Poll released Tuesday indicated 50% of Americans believe same-sex marriages should be recognized by law as valid with 48% saying such marriages should not be legal – a dramatic shift from a few years ago. A Gallup poll in 2009 found 40% supported same-sex marriage and 57% were opposed.But a CNN/ORC International poll taken in late March indicated policies toward gays and lesbians were tied for last in people’s opinions of the most-important issues facing the country.Obama said he supports states deciding the issue on their own but added that he was “disappointed” by Tuesday’s vote on the issue in North Carolina where a ban on same-sex marriage was added to the constitution. Obama called the amendment discriminatory against gays and lesbians a spokesman said earlier Wednesday.Six states – Massachusetts Connecticut Iowa Vermont New Hampshire and New York – and the District of Columbia issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples while 31 states have voted in favor of constitutional amendments that seek to defend traditional definitions of marriage as a heterosexual union.In February Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire signed a bill that would legalize same-sex marriage beginning in June but opponents there have pledged to block the bill and called for voters to decide the issue. Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley signed into law a bill that permits the state’s same-sex couples to wed as of January 1 and state residents may vote to affirm such a law.Minnesota will vote on a state constitutional amendment similar to the one in North Carolina while Maine will have a referendum on allowing same-sex marriage. Meanwhile two cases seeking to overturn laws forbidding the practice one from California and another from Massachusetts could be headed to the U.S. Supreme Court in coming months.CNN’s Josh Levs Phil Gast Bill Mears Dan Gilgoff and Jim Acosta contributed to this report.\",\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON — He’s vented attacked apologized and adjusted. Now President Obama has one move left in his attempt to salvage the rollout of his healthcare law: hope the website works soon.The White House knowing a functional website is needed to calm its panicky allies has now entered the wait-and-see period of its triage after the turmoil that has followed the Oct. 1 rollout. With the latest fix to the law unveiled a bruising House vote behind them and experts working feverishly on the broken website administration officials believe they may have weathered the worst.Although Obama’s standing in polls and support within his party have dropped sharply much like the downward trajectory of George W. Bush’s second term White House officials believe he can still recover.That optimistic assessment depends almost entirely on the administration’s ability to reboot healthcare.gov the once-hyped online insurance marketplace now undergoing extensive repair. At stake are the future of the president’s signature domestic achievement his political standing and reelection prospects for vulnerable Democrats in Congress.AdvertisementIf the administration meets its goal of a mostly glitch-free site by the end of November the last two months may be remembered as just another near-death experience for a healthcare overhaul that has had many. Even though many insurance executives and congressional Democrats are angry at Obama for his handling of the healthcare law both groups have strong incentives to help the Affordable Care Act succeed.But if the White House fails the recent setbacks could become the beginning of years of trouble for Democrats in office as well as those seeking to get there officials concede.Administration officials privately acknowledge that no argument defending Obamacare will connect with Americans until they begin to see the effects of the law at work. No work-around or temporary fix will reach enough people to build a critical mass of support. The website has to function admit edgy aides who sometimes spit the word “website” with the contempt familiar to anyone who has ever called a tech help desk.Obama revealed his own frustrations Thursday saying at a White House news conference that he has an obligation to show Americans that the law has made health insurance more affordable and accessible — “if we can just get the darn website working and smooth this thing out.”AdvertisementOfficials said Friday they were making progress on the site’s many glitches and bugs. It now takes less than one second on average to load a page down from eight seconds in the weeks after the launch said Jeffrey Zients a former top administration official who was brought back to oversee the repairs. The site can “comfortably” handle 20000 to 25000 consumers at the same time and more capacity is being added he said.Still problems persist in the system that sends consumer information to insurers and as experts have ticked off 200 software problems more continue to pop up. Zients said the officials expect to make the Nov. 30 goal but added: “Not all consumers going on the website will have a seamless experience.”While the tech team works the president must convince his allies as well as his potential adversaries that as he said Thursday he’s a clutch player who knows how to recover from a fumble.That group includes insurance executives who were called to the White House on Friday to discuss Obama’s answer to the millions of policy cancellation notices sent to surprised consumers. After announcing Thursday that he would allow insurers to rescind those cancellations and extend the policies for another year the president sought to persuade the executives to take him up on the offer.AdvertisementThe group also includes Democrats on Capitol Hill many of whom have gone from disgruntled to distrustful of the White House. On Friday 39 House Democrats voted for the GOP alternative to Obama’s extension fix.That sizable number of largely swing-district lawmakers was only the most visible sign of broader dissatisfaction that makes Obama’s current holding pattern a challenge. Even those who stuck with the White House on Friday’s vote have expressed frustration. In the wake of Obama’s announcement lawmakers were left to figure out whether their state officials and insurers would go along with the plan. Skepticism was high.“The message from the White House is ‘OK you can be mad it’s frustrating. But be on the program’” said one advisor to a House Democrat who asked for anonymity while characterizing internal discussions. “But what program is that? The program where every five minutes there’s a different plan?”Polling shows the public has similar doubts. For the first time in his presidency fewer than half of Americans polled told Gallup that Obama was a “strong and decisive leader” a 6-percentage-point drop since September. The perception of Obama as “honest and trustworthy” and public confidence in his ability to manage government took a similar tumble.AdvertisementA continued slide combined with continued technical glitches could leave the White House little choice but to make additional changes to the law — mostly likely extending the enrollment period and delaying the penalties for people who don’t carry insurance. Senate Democrats already have urged such a move.But in the face of ardent Republican opposition to the law — House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) on Friday repeated his hope to repeal “this train wreck” — the White House has resisted any fix that puts it at the mercy of House Republicans and pushes votes on the law well into an election year.“That will always be an option of extreme last resort” said Drew Altman president and chief executive of the Kaiser Family Foundation.The White House has long argued that the popularity of the healthcare law will hinge on the popularity of its benefits — an untested theory until the public can easily access the online marketplaces that showcase most of those benefits. Still in the pileup of bad news for Obama there was some reason to hope that the policy now largely locked behind the broken site might have a chance of winning over the public.AdvertisementThough enrollment numbers in October were dismal consumer interest was strong. Nationwide more than 1.1 million people completed applications to get coverage; 106000 actually selected a plan.Data from several states operating their own marketplaces suggest demand for health plans may be accelerating.In California 35000 people selected a health plan in October. Nearly the same number signed up in just the first two weeks of November according to Covered California the state’s marketplace. Kentucky has seen similar growth: 5586 people signed up in October and nearly 4000 did in the first two weeks of November.“We are feeling incredibly optimistic” said Gwenda Bond a spokeswoman for the state health agency that operates Kentucky’s marketplace known as kynect.AdvertisementThe White House may have a long wait Altman noted before it knows how far that optimism will spread.“In the long term ultimately the website will be working this issue of cancellations will be in the rear-view mirror and the real question will be whether people who get coverage under the law like it or not” Altman said. “The real story about whether the law works or not will unfold next year and the year after that.”kathleen.hennessey@latimes.comchristi.parsons@latimes.comAdvertisementTimes staff writer Noam N.

       " 'Time to go on offense Mr. President.Time to go on offense Mr. President.The Affordable Care Act was designed to make sure all Americans had a certain level of insurance. But TPM has learned that USHealth Group is actively telling consumers that they don\\'t need that minimum level. In fact company representatives are telling people they\\'d be better off without it. And the company may be just one player in a larger industry trend where companies see non-ACA compliant plans like the so-called fixed benefit coverage marketed by USHealth Group as a business opportunity. Health care industry analysts have long derided the kinds of non-insurance health care coverage products the company is selling as \"junk insurance.\" \"They were not intended to be health insurance\" Sabrina Corlette a research professor at the Health Policy Institute at Georgetown University told TPM speaking about fixed benefit plans. \"They were intended to be what are called income replacement policies. ... But over the years these things have kind of morphed. And for many people unfortunately mainly because they come with a cheaper sticker price they are marketed as and treated as health insurance. Even though the coverage is really crappy.\" USHealth Group\\'s pitch is three-fold according to accounts provided to TPM by Mortimer and another prospective customer. First it says it is a misconception that everyone needs ACA-compliant insurance. Second USHealth Group plans are cheaper than ACA-compliant policies even after customers pay the tax penalty for failing to comply with the ACA\\'s individual mandate. Third Obamacare is scary.Democrats should not be panicking over the relatively tiny number of people losing their junk health insurance plans. They should be loudly and continuously beating up on the insurance companies using Obamacare to trick people into buying new ones. Case in point: USHealth Group What USHealth Group isn\\'t telling would-be customers what they are is that these fixed benefit coverage plans in which the company reimburses customers a fixed amount of money for medical services don\\'t comply with the law. These plans aren\\'t outlawed by Obamacare but they don\\'t meet the requirements for coverage. That means that people buying them are just wasting their money because they will also have to get real coverage and if they don\\'t they\\'ll have to pay a penalty. They also won\\'t have any coverage if they get sick. One of these kinds of plans Karen Pollitz a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation said is \"not health insurance in the sense it\\'s going to protect you in any way from going broke.\"Other only slightly less dastardly insurers are misleading their customers canceling policies that otherwise would have been grandfathered in order to get people into new ones that they can charge more for and not informing customers about their options on the exchanges. The president\\'s administration fix would at least require insurers who do cancel plans to inform people of their options.It\\'s not too late for Democrats including President Obama to go on offense against the insurance companies that are making the roll-out of Obamacare that much more difficult. Obama has met Republicans partway with his \"fix\" for policy cancellations. Now\\'s the time to say enough and to start reminding people about what insurance companies do and why they made this law so necessary in the first place.',\n",
       " 'Deborah Cavallaro is a hard-working real estate agent in the Westchester suburb of Los Angeles who has been featured prominently on a round of news shows lately talking about how badly Obamacare is going to cost her when her existing plan gets canceled and she has to find a replacement.She says she’s angry at President Obama for having promised that people who like their health plans could keep them when hers is getting canceled for not meeting Obamacare’s standards.“Please explain to me” she told Maria Bartiromo on CNBC Wednesday “how my plan is a ‘substandard’ plan when ... I’d be paying more for the exchange plans than I am currently paying by a wide margin.”Bartiromo didn’t take her up on her request. So I will.AdvertisementSEE ALSO: Why men should pay for pregnancy coverageThe bottom line is that Cavallaro’s assertion that “there’s nothing affordable about the Affordable Care Act” as she put it Tuesday on NBC Channel 4 is the product of her own misunderstandings abetted by a passel of uninformed and incurious news reporters.I talked with Cavallaro 60 after her CNBC appearance. Let’s walk through what she told me.Her current plan from Anthem Blue Cross is a catastrophic coverage plan for which she pays $293 a month as an individual policyholder. It requires her to pay a deductible of $5000 a year and limits her out-of-pocket costs to $8500 a year. Her plan also limits her to two doctor visits a year for which she shoulders a copay of $40 each. After that she pays the whole cost of subsequent visits.AdvertisementThis fits the very definition of a nonconforming plan under Obamacare. The deductible and out-of-pocket maximums are too high the provisions for doctor visits too skimpy.As for a replacement plan she says she was quoted $478 a month by her insurance broker but that’s a lot more than she’ll really be paying. Cavallaro told me she hasn’t checked the website of Covered California the state’s health plan exchange herself. I did so while we talked.Here’s what I found. I won’t divulge her current income which is personal but this year it qualifies her for a hefty federal premium subsidy.At her age she’s eligible for a good “silver” plan for $333 a month after the subsidy -- $40 a month more than she’s paying now. But the plan is much better than her current plan -- the deductible is $2000 not $5000. The maximum out-of-pocket expense is $6350 not $8500. Her co-pays would be $45 for a primary care visit and $65 for a specialty visit -- but all visits would be covered not just two.AdvertisementIs that better than her current plan? Yes by a mile.If she wanted to pay less Cavallaro could opt for lesser coverage in a “bronze” plan. She could buy one from the California exchange for as little as $194 a month. From Anthem it’s $256 or $444 a year less than she’s paying now. That buys her a $5000 deductible (the same as she’s paying today) but the out-of-pocket limit is lower $6350. Office visits would be $60 for primary care and $70 for specialties but again with no limit on the number of visits. Factor in the premium savings and it’s hard to deny that she’s still ahead.Cavallaro told me a couple of things that are worth considering. First what she likes about her current plan is that she can go to any doctor of her choice and any hospital. That’s not entirely true because her current plan with Anthem does favor a network. Plainly however it’s broad enough to serve her purposes. She’s concerned that the new plans will offer smaller networks which is probably true though it’s not necessarily true that the new networks will exclude her favorite doctors hospitals or prescription formularies.She also mentioned that her annual income fluctuates. It can be substantially lower or substantially higher than it is this year. What if next year she earns too much to qualify for the subsidy? Also a fair point -- at her current income the subsidy is worth more than $200 a month to her. But that’s not the same as saying that “there’s nothing affordable about the Affordable Care Act” because at her current income the act is vastly more affordable to her than what she’s paying now.AdvertisementWhen she told Channel 4 that “for the first time in my whole life I will be without insurance” it’s hard to understand what she was talking about. (Channel 4 didn’t ask.) Better plans than she has now are available for her to purchase today some of them for less money.The sad truth is that Cavallaro has been very poorly served by the health insurance industry and the news media. It seems that Anthem didn’t adequately explain her options for 2014 when it disclosed that her current plan is being canceled. If her insurance brokers told her what she says they did they failed her. And the reporters who interviewed her without getting all the facts produced inexcusably shoddy work -- from Maria Bartiromo on down. They not only did her a disservice but failed the rest of us too.',\n",
       " '7 years agoWashington (CNN) – House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said Sunday neither she nor President Barack Obama misled the American people when they said during the run-up to the passage of Obamacare that people could keep their health insurance plans.Pelosi clarified their remarks saying they only meant people could keep their plans if they had already signed up before Obama signed the bill in 2010.[twitter-follow screen_name=\\'politicalticker\\'] [twitter-follow screen_name=\\'gregclarycnn\\']\"(Obama is) gracious and he\\'s taking responsibility” Pelosi said on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” “But that doesn\\'t mean there\\'s anything in the law that said if you like what you had before 2010 you couldn\\'t keep it.\"The Affordable Care Act allows for people to keep their health plans if they had signed up before the bill was enacted - but not after.Fact Check: If you liked your health plan you can keep your health planThe president repeatedly said during the campaign for health care reform that if people liked their insurance plans they could keep them.Following many health plan cancellation notices – a million in California alone – Obama told the American people Thursday he’s responsible for not having been clear.“I completely get how upsetting this can be for a lot of Americans particularly after assurances they heard from me that if they had a plan that they liked they could keep it. And to those Americans I hear you loud and clear” Obama said.The President offered a short-term fix allowing people who have had plans canceled to remain on them for an additional year.On Friday the House passed a bill with bipartisan support allowing people to stay on their plans permanently. It’s unclear whether that bill will have a chance to move forward or if Obama might even veto it if it passed in the Senate.The fumbling – Obama’s word - rollout of Obamacare may take a toll on Democratic prospects in next year’s midterm elections even though the party came out on top in opinion polls following a government shutdown last month. That shutdown now seems like a distant memory.\"I don\\'t think you can tell what will happen next year but I will tell you this: Democrats stand tall in support of the Affordable Care Act” Pelosi said.“What\\'s important about it is that the American people get served not who gets re-elected.”',\n",
       " 'And so far you have to admit this Scam has worked beautifully. The White House has been rocked back on their heels not just by the rollout problems of HealthCare.gov (which is now actually working) but also by these Scammy \"Cancellation Letters\". But now the charlatans behind the curtain are finally being revealed.Donna received the letter canceling her insurance plan on Sept. 16. Her insurance company LifeWise of Washington told her that they\\'d identified a new plan for her. If she did nothing she\\'d be covered. A 56-year-old Seattle resident with a 57-year-old husband and 15-year-old daughter Donna had been looking forward to the savings that the Affordable Care Act had to offer. But that\\'s not what she found. Instead she\\'d be paying an additional $300 a month for coverage. The letter made no mention of the health insurance marketplace that would soon open in Washington where she could shop for competitive plans and only an oblique reference to financial help that she might qualify for if she made the effort to call and find out. Otherwise she\\'d be automatically rolled over to a new plan -- and as the letter said \"If you\\'re happy with this plan do nothing.\" If Donna had done nothing she would have ended up spending about $1000 more a month for insurance than she will now that she went to the marketplace picked the best plan for her family and accessed tax credits at the heart of the health care reform law. \"The info that we were sent by LifeWise was totally bogus. Why the heck did they try to screw us?\" Donna said. \"People who are afraid of the ACA should be much more afraid of the insurance companies who will exploit their fear and end up overcharging them.\" Donna is not alone.No she\\'s not alone. It\\'s not clear how widespread this practice has been but some State insurance commissioners are starting to notice. In Kentucky Insurance Provider Humana was fined $65000 for sending out misleading letters.The Kentucky Department of Insurance has fined Humana $65430 because it offered policyholders an unapproved opportunity to amend their insurance as part of a letter that regulators have called “misleading.” The department investigated letters sent in August to 6543 individual plan policyholders in Kentucky. The letters said they needed to renew their plans for 2014 within 30 days or choose a more expensive option that complies with the Affordable Care Act. But regulators last month called the letters misleading arguing they did not make sufficiently clear that policyholders could compare and choose competing plans on the state’s health insurance exchanges which open on Oct. 1 and for which they could be eligible for federal subsidies.Let\\'s follow this logically if the letters were sent in August and required a response within 30 days - it essentially forced the policy holders to choose the worse possible option before the Oct 1st launch of their State Exchange. That is a classic \"High Pressure\" sales tactic. \"Buy NOW or you\\'ll miss out. SALE ENDING SOON\" - when in fact there was no legitimate reason to push people make a decision in that 30 day window other than to prevent them from shopping on the Exchange. Read the Human Letter. 2200 people actually did respond within that 30 period but Kentucy regulators after finding they had been deceived by Humana released them from that agreement and allowed them to go ahead and shop for a better plan on the marketplace. Then they fined Humana for their attempted Scam.[Kentucky Insurance Commissioner Sharon] Clark gave the example of a single mother with children who was urged to sign up for a Humana plan with a monthly premium of $719.86. That price is higher than any comparable plan for sale on the state\\'s insurance marketplace Clark said -- not to mention that the mother might have qualified for tax subsidies to help pay for it if she went through the marketplace as Donna did.So the next time you hear or read about how ObamaCare has caused someone to lose their inexpensive plan only to be forced to choose a much more expensive one. Don\\'t Believe It. As Adm. Akbar would say: It\\'s. A. Trap! Vyan8:42 AM PT: To be fair as VcLib pointed out in the comments not every plan was automatically Grandfathered. There were these restrictions via https://www.healthcare.gov/....All health plans must:.End lifetime limits on coverage.End arbitrary cancellations of health coverage.Cover adult children up to age 26.Provide a Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC) a short easy-to-understand summary of what a plan covers and costs.Hold insurance companies accountable to spend your premiums on health care not administrative costs and bonuses Grandfathered plans DON\\'T have to:.Cover preventive care for free.Guarantee your right to appeal.Protect your choice of doctors and access to emergency care .Be held accountable through Rate Review for excessive premium increases In addition to the above grandfathered individual health insurance plans (the kind you buy yourself not the kind you get from an employer) don\\'t have to: .End yearly limits on coverage .Cover you if you have a pre-existing health conditionSo if you had a plan that had a lifetime cap didn\\'t cover your children until they were 26 could be arbitrarily cancelled and didn\\'t spend 80-85% of your premiums on your care - that plan would have to be updated or replaced. If you had a plan like that and for some reason liked it then you were always going to have to make an adjustment to a plan that doesn\\'t suck anymore. The question is would you be able to shop for the best possible option or would you stay with the options given by your current provider? These letters show that some providers tried to corral their clients into staying and accepting a much higher rate - blaming the ACA for it - and therefore scaring them away from the Exchange Marketplace. We\\'ve been hearing that the reason these plans were more expensive is because they had to cover preventive care (Limbaugh had a field-day with that one last week) but as shown above the Grandfathered Plans Didn\\'t. It\\'s a scam it\\'s all a scam.10:13 AM PT: One more issue on Grandfathered Plans via the CommentsPlans could acquire grandfathered status by adding those features to the existing ones they did not have to already have them in place. Some of the elements like the \"no lifetime cap\" one were phased in over time and therefore explicitly allowed adjustment of benefits in an existing plan. Coverage of children under 26 is not likely to be a feature that many plans had in early 2010 yet clearly insurance plans have added this feature. My current coverage has grandfathered status. It had some of these features like no lifetime cap other benefits have been added or modified to comply with the grandfathering requirements.So you got that? Grandfathered Plans are not written in unbendable unbreakable Adamantium they can and have been amended since 2010. They don\\'t have to meet all the requirements of the ACA just a few of them and have to have existed since before the law was passed and signed - That\\'s All.So let\\'s go back and revisit \"If you like your plan you can keep it\" as being flawed or wrong. It\\'s NOT. Instead of amending the plans to meet minimum grandfather requirements they are being Shutdown By the Insurance Industries Choice not by ObamaCare.1:34 PM PT: One final point that puts the LIE to the claim that these plans couldn\\'t meet the Grandfathered requirements is the fact that There\\'s Nothing New Required of Grandfathered Plans This Year.The Lifting of the Lifetime Spending Cap has been phased in since 2010.The law restricts and phases out the annual dollar limits that all job-related plans and individual health insurance plans issued after March 23 2010 can put on most covered health benefits. Specifically the law says that none of these plans can set an annual dollar limit lower than:$750000: for a plan year or policy year starting on or after September 23 2010 but before September 23 2011.$1.25 million: for a plan year or policy year starting on or after September 23 2011 but before September 23 2012.$2 million: for a plan year or policy year starting on or after September 23 2012 but before January 1 2014. No annual dollar limits are allowed on most covered benefits beginning January 1 2014.It\\'s not like the ACA suddenly requires old insurance plans to do something this year that they weren\\'t essentially required to do last year - other than PAY peoples claims.Similarly the ability to keep your children on your family plan isn\\'t new that was established in 2010.ffective for Plan or Policy Years Beginning On or After September 23 2010. Secretary Kathleen Sebelius called on leading insurance companies to begin covering young adults voluntarily before the implementation date required by the Affordable Care Act (which is plan or policy years beginning on or after September 23rd). Early implementation would avoid gaps in coverage for new college graduates and other young adults and save on insurance company administrative costs of dis-enrolling and re-enrolling them between May 2010 and September 23 2010. Over 65 companies have responded to this call saying they will voluntarily continue coverage for young adults who graduate or age off their parents\\' insurance before the implementation deadline.Lastly the requirement to spend at least 80% of your premiums on care and not administrative costs has already been in effect that\\'s why people have been getting rebate checks.A new provision of the Affordable Care Act — called the Medical Loss Ratio or the “80/20″ provision — could mean some Americans will see a rebate from their health insurance companies tomorrow. The provision is aimed at holding health insurance companies accountable for how they spend the money collected through premiums. It compares the dollars they spend on health care costs vs. other overhead costs — like marketing salaries and administrative expenses.Grandfathered plans don\\'t have to cover pre-existing conditions. Grandfathered plans don\\'t have to provide free preventive care services. (High Co-Pays and Deductibles can remain) Grandfathered plans can still limit yearly coverage (in the individual market).In short there is no New Special Expensive OBAMACARE Requirement on existing Grandfathered plans other the fact that the lifetime cap has gone from $2 Million to Infinite and they can\\'t arbitrarily CANCEL your insurance between renewal periods. They can only do it at the end of you plan year which is exactly what they\\'re doing - simply because they can not because Obamacare put some onerous expensive requirement on them.Just about everything they were required by the ACA to do this year they had to do LAST YEAR and the year before that. Even more than when I first wrote this diary now believe these \"ObamaCare Cancellations\" are a SCAM.',\n",
       " 'On Friday two prominent Republican backers of the Senate immigration bill hosted a conference call with reporters to reveal the “history” behind some organizations opposing the legislation. According to the speakers a significant amount of the opposition to immigration reform is being led by liberals environmentalists and pro-abortion and eugenics activists worried about population growth.“[T]he primary leaders and funders of the anti-immigration movement were drawn to it because they were also active organizers and supporters of and contributors to the population-control movement in the United States” Mario Lopez a speaker on the call recently wrote. Lopez is President of the Hispanic Leadership Fund. Lopez was joined on the call by Josh Culling with Grover Norquist’s Americans for Tax Reform.This ad hominem argument is both inane and irrelevant. People come into issues from all kinds of vantage points. I have no doubt that there active immigration reform opponents who are liberals or have overblown worries about population growth. Those views however don’t discredit what they may say on a different issue. Nor do those views discredit what people without those views believe on an issue.Friday’s call was a leftist tactic to discount what millions of Americans feel about an issue because some other people hold views with which they would disagree. It was reminiscent of the media’s attempt to smear the entire Tea Party movement because a handful of people said or did something stupid.Even if one were to cede the premise that an entire infrastructure to oppose immigration reform were built by population control activists the fact is immaterial to the concerns many have about the legislation before the Senate. Even if you support expansive legal immigration it is a bad bill. Its fatal flaw is that it doesn’t secure the border or increase enforcement in any meaningful way. One doesn’t have to be a population control zealot to see the fundamental problem with that approach.Surely the speakers would hopefully acknowledge there are many opposed to the Senate bill who don’t believe in population control. I would wager the overwhelming majority of Americans who have concerns about the bill are not advocates of abortion or eugenics to control the population. So why are the views of a decided minority relevant to an issue with national implications?The richest irony of the call was that the speakers are allies of groups like SEIU and La Raza in supporting the specific Senate proposal. One could just as easily have a convened a press call to discuss the “history” behind these groups and why conservatives should be cautious about working with them. The speakers on the call for example acknowledged doing at least some work with the National Immigration Forum which has received considerable funding from George Soros’ Open Society Institute. Is that the proper alliance for a conservative?No one should schedule such a call however. Issues should be decided on merits not ad hominem aspersions about someone else’s motives. The call was an attempt to smear all opposition to the Senate bill as arising out of the questionable beliefs of a few people. It was an attempt to quash rather than foster debate on the underlying merits of the proposal.The call also perpetuated a dangerously false choice. Conservatives should either accept legislation largely written by Sen. Chuck Schumer or be labeled as against reform. That our allies are forcing this choice is unconscionable.',\n",

American embassies in Yemen and Tunisia were also facing a “serious threat.

U.S. diplomatic posts in some 20 countries under threatClinton said threats to U.S. diplomatic posts are ongoing.“Sitting here today we probably have at least 20 other posts that are under a serious threat environment as I speak to you” she told senators. “We operate in places where we know that our facilities are being surveilled for potential attacks where we have a steady Intel stream of plotting.”Clinton detailed what the State Department has done to begin implementing the 29 recommendations of the Accountability Review Board to improve security at diplomatic posts in high-threat areas in addition to a few of her own.Opinion: Benghazi blame game is uselessSpecifically Clinton has appointed a team led by her deputy to focus on tightening security sent joint teams of military special forces and diplomatic security threat analysts to more than a dozen high-risk posts and appointed a senior official to focus exclusively on those areas.The State Department is also working to streamline requests for security so they make their way more quickly up the chain of leadership.Despite the threat Clinton stressed the importance of U.S. leadership and diplomatic presence in the Middle East.“We’ve come a long way in the past four years and we cannot afford to retreat now” Clinton told senators. “When America is absent especially from unstable environments there are consequences.

Clinton not shying away from a fightClinton grew emotional and held back tears when talking about U.S. personnel killed in the Benghazi attack.“For me this is not just a matter of policy it’s personal. I stood next to President Obama as the Marines carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews” Clinton said as she choked back tears. “I put my arms around the mothers and fathers the sisters and brothers the sons and daughters and the wives left alone to raise their children.”But she lost patience with the focus of Republican senators on talking points used by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice on the next Sunday’s talk shows that focused on a protest at the U.S. post in Benghazi which turned out not to have taken place.Opinion: Rand Paul vs. Hillary Clinton clash of titansWhen Sen. Ron Johnson pressed Clinton on why the State Department didn’t call U.S. personnel who were evacuated from Benghazi to determine whether there was a protest Clinton took him to task.“With all due respect the fact is we had four dead Americans” Clinton reminded Johnson as she banged her hand on the table.“Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided they’d go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening” she said.Photos: Hillary Clinton through the years4. Militants in Mali and Algeria have arms from LibyaClinton warned the security situation in northern Mali where international forces are battling militants has been exacerbated by flow of weapons from neighboring Libya following the fall of Moammar Gadhafi.She said there was “no doubt” such weapons were also used in an attack by militants on an Algerian natural gas plant last week.She noted the aftermath of the Arab spring has changed power dynamics and stretched security forces across the region thin.Calling the campaign struggle against the Islamic fighters a necessary response to “a very serious ongoing threat” Clinton said the “United States cannot permit northern Mali to become a safe-haven for Islamist rebels that could eventually pose a more direct threat to U.S. interests.”Noting the increased strength of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb the regional affiliate of the al Qaeda network fighting along side local Malians Clinton warned that the United States must prepare for the possibility that groups like AQIM could threaten direct attacks on U.S. interests as they gain power.“You can’t say because they haven’t done something they’re not going to do it” Clinton said. “This is not only a terrorist syndicate it is a criminal enterprise.

Republicans still aren’t buying itWhile their tone was generally respectful several Republican senators made clear they were unsatisfied with Clinton’s answers.Sen. John McCain R-Arizona one of the administration’s toughest critics since the Benghazi attack took Clinton to task for what he considered lackluster attention to the growing threat in Benghazi.McCain wanted to know why Clinton hadn’t read a cable from Ambassador Christopher Stevens warning that the mission in Benghazi could not survive a sustained assault.Sen. Rand Paul said it would have been an offense worthy of firing Clinton had he been president.McCain also blasted Clinton’s answers to questions about the administration’s claim that a protest had taken place in Benghazi.“The American people deserve to know answers and they certainly don’t deserve false answers” McCain told Clinton.Clinton was more diplomatic with her old friend saying she respected his strong feelings for the incident given his own relationship with Stevens but that they disagreed about what happened and when it happened with respect to explaining events.In addition to lessons the State Department learned about improving security at diplomatic posts Clinton who called the Benghazi attack an act of terrorism since Day One suggested the administration might learn another lesson.“Just withhold. Don’t say what you don’t know for sure until it’s finally decided.”Read more: Polls on Clinton’s side\",\n",

That information is useful.\"However Obama did acknowledge that recent accusations of the government spying on average Americans has “raised a lot of questions for people.”In a lighter exchange Obama was asked about his lunch meeting with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Obama did not get into the specifics of the meeting with his former campaign rival but joked about Clinton\\'s \"glow\" since leaving government.\"We had a great time and she had that post-administration glow\" Obama told Leno. \"When folks leave the White House like two weeks later they look great!\"Obama also had kind words for another former rival John McCain.When Leno asked Obama about his blossoming \"bromance\" with the Arizona Republican Obama joked \"That\\'s how classic romantic comedies go.\" He went on to say \"He is a person of integrity. He is willing to say things regardless of the politics ... It\\'s probably not good for me to compliment him on television.\"Leno was also asked about former NSA contractor Edward Snowden who has recently received a one year asylum in Russia after leaking classified information about U.S. intelligence programs.Story continues\"We don’t know exactly what he did except what he said on the Internet and it\\'s important for me not to judge\" Obama said.However Obama did say that in light of the incident he has asked the White House staff to look at ways of reducing the number of contract employees employed by federal agencies.As to Russia’s decision to grant Snowden temporary asylum Obama said he did not think that or the recent controversy surrounding Russia’s stance on gay rights would deter the U.S. from participating in next year’s Winter Olympic games in Sochi Russia.\"I think Putin and Russia have a big stake in making sure the Olympics work\" he said. \"I think they understand that for most of the countries that participate in the Olympics we wouldn\\'t tolerate gays and lesbians being treated differently\" he said.',\n",

There\\'s only one little problem with that: Clinton did not \"sign\" the letter. Darrell Issa and the rest of the Crack House Investigative Team of Superheroes got confused on a basic fact of how the State Department works and not one of them bothered to actually freaking check just once with the State Department as to their top-notch theory of things:[By tradition] every cable from an embassy bears the “signature” of the ambassador — and every cable from Washington bears the “signature” of the secretary of state. The protocol is explained in the State Department’s Foreign Affairs Manual: […] Because of this protocol “Secretary Clinton ‘signed’ hundreds of thousands of cables during her tenure as secretary” said State Department spokesman Patrick H. Ventrell. “As then-Secretary Clinton testified the security cables related to Benghazi did not come to her attention. These cables were reviewed at the assistant secretary level.”“The allegations in your staff report are false extremely irresponsible and lack even a rudimentary understanding of how State Department cables are processed” Cummings wrote in a letter to House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). […] “Although a telephone call could have clarified this issue in a matter of moments you chose not to check with the Department before making these highly inflammatory and erroneous accusations in a public forum.”Yep. The entire House Republican \"investigative\" team didn\\'t know that and they didn\\'t check and/or they didn\\'t listen to Every Damn State Department Employee Who Could Tell Them That. Or as Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings puts it Has there ever been a Congress more incompetent than this one? I don\\'t mean partisan or mean or ineffective—I mean stone-cold incompetent.

       " 'President Obama is being accused of selectively quoting Usama bin Laden by using a snippet of an anti-America screed to make it sound like Al Qaeda was breaking under the weight of the U.S. drone program.Obama quoted the Al Qaeda leader during his wide-ranging speech on counterterrorism policy last Thursday in Washington. As part of his argument in defense of the lethal drone program Obama suggested bin Laden himself deemed the strikes to be effective.\"Don\\'t take my word for it\" Obama said. \"In the intelligence gathered at bin Laden\\'s compound we found that he wrote \\'We could lose the reserves to enemy\\'s airstrikes. We cannot fight airstrikes with explosives.\\'\"It is without question that the strikes have killed key terror leaders and have changed the way Al Qaeda and its affiliates operate. The bin Laden document Obama referenced said as much.But the document -- one of several bin Laden writings published by West Point\\'s Combating Terrorism Center -- showed bin Laden discussing how drones strikes have changed his organization\\'s tactics not necessarily how they have Al Qaeda on the run.More On This...The document which refers repeatedly to the \"ummah\" or Muslim population says: \"The Ummah should put forward some but enough forces to fight America. The Ummah must keep some of its forces on reserve. This will be in the Ummah\\'s best interests. The Ummah will use the reserve in the future but during the appropriate time.\"In the meanwhile we do not want to send the reserves to the front line especially in areas where the enemy only uses airstrikes to attack our forces. So the reserves will not for the most part be effective in such conflicts. Basically we could lose the reserves to enemy\\'s airstrikes. We cannot fight air strikes with explosives!\"The document goes on to say that \"we still have a powerful force which we can organize and prepare for deployment.\"Thomas Joscelyn a senior fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies argued that bin Laden\\'s full quote has a far different meaning than that conveyed by the excerpt Obama cited last week.\"When you look at the context of the whole statement it doesn\\'t support their story\" he told FoxNews.com.He acknowledged that the drones have killed senior terrorists but said \"it\\'s just more complicated than that.\"Joscelyn wrote in The Weekly Standard: \"The full quote actually supports a different argument -- that al Qaeda\\'s \\'reserves\\' have been removed from the drones\\' kill box. It is quite obvious that improvised explosive devices car bombs small arms and the like cannot take out unmanned drones. So Al Qaeda has simply moved some of its forces elsewhere.\"Joscelyn said the \"selective citation\" speaks to a broader problem -- \"the president and his administration only see what they want to see in the fight against Al Qaeda and affiliates groups.\"In his counterterrorism speech Obama said the \"core of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan is on the path to defeat\" while at the same time acknowledging Al Qaeda affiliates continue to threaten U.S. interests.Obama vowed to put new limits on the U.S. drone program while defending the need for it in an unconventional war.Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham speaking on \"Fox News Sunday\" accused Obama of \"sounding retreat\" in the address.\"At the end of the day this is the most tone-deaf president I ever could imagine\" he said.Other lawmakers praised Obama for taking new steps to disclose details about the U.S. drone program.\"I am also encouraged that the administration is taking steps to improve transparency as it pertains to the use of lethal force particularly when it comes to the possible targeting of U.S. citizens\" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy D-Vt. said last week.',\n",

None of the Republican groups have said their applications were rejected. Progress Texas another of the organizations faced the same lines of questioning as the Tea Party groups from the same IRS office that issued letters to the Republican-friendly applicants. A third group Clean Elections Texas which supports public funding of campaigns also received IRS inquiries.Missing from much coverage is the relevant recent history—the role of the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision and how it prompted a deluge of requests from new organizations seeking tax-exempt status under tax code Section 501(c)(4) as “social welfare” organizations—despite the fact that many of these are blatantly political operations.decision and how it prompted a deluge of requests from new organizations seeking tax-exempt status under tax code Section 501(c)(4) as “social welfare” organizations—despite the fact that many of these are blatantly political operations. Congress requires the IRS to review every application for tax-exempt status to weed out organizations that are partisan political or that generate private gain. Congress has imposed this requirement on the IRS and its predecessor agencies since 1913.The maelstrom over the revelation that the IRS targeted anti-tax Tea Party groups applying for tax exempt status for scrutiny is showing no signs of slowing down with Republicans seeing their chance to milk a scandal for political purposes. But while the politics is heating up some important context is emerging like the fact that liberal groups were targeted as well  and in fact the only group to have its application denied was a liberal group.The IRS released a statement late Tuesday admitting that it had pooled together the applications of groups that were politically active and incorrectly used the names of some of the groups—a \"minority\" of them—as the basis for targeting them. Which David Cay Johnston at the reminds readers is the IRS\\'s job.Those are just two of the salient points Johnston makes to give the critical context behind this scandal. He also points out that the IRS is tasked with the vague and mushy directive to distinguish between groups are \"primarily engaged\" in politics versus those that are primarily engaged in \"social welfare\" and getting to that distinction is a challenge for an agency deluged by applications post-and which has had its budget slashed by 17 percent per capita in the last decade. The agency processed501(c)(4) applications in 2012.The other point he makes which we\\'re not hearing frequently or loudly enough in the response to the kerfuffle is a real scandal: \"the social welfare tax exemption is being used by existing 501(c)(4) organizations including some very large ones to promote partisan political interests—the very activity Congress has explicitly prohibited for a century.\" In other words Karl Rove and Crossroads.This is a serious issue one deserving of investigation.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite File)By Thomas FerraroWASHINGTON March 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress is getting an earful about the big spending cuts beginning to hit government services from worried and irate constituents including one senator\\'s own spouse.Democratic Senator Thomas Carper of Delaware said his wife \"my most important constituent\" asked him \"Why can\\'t you guys get your act together? Do you know what people think of you guys?\"\"I told her that Washington needs to work more like Delaware\" said Carper a former governor of the state. \"In Delaware Democrats and Republicans work together.\"They have not worked together in Washington. And so the across-the-board cuts of the so-called \"sequester\" - which both Republicans and Democrats have said they oppose - took effect Friday night after President Barack Obama and Republican leaders failed to agree on a way to replace them with targeted spending reductions.Up until the final few days before Friday when the reductions began because of a law enacted in 2011 constituents urged some begged lawmakers to avert them.The cuts threaten the U.S. economic recovery could disrupt federal services from airports to national parks and may force furloughs of hundreds of thousands of federal workers and employees of federal contractors the administration says.\"They want to kill us all\" Senator Orrin Hatch a Utah Republican said of his constituents.Laura Zayner a senior officer with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security at Chicago\\'s O\\'Hare Airport was among 400 federal workers facing possible furloughs who came to Washington last week to lobby Congress.\"We consider the furlough a slap in the face. We take it personally\" Zayner said. \"We are not picking sides Democrats or Republicans. But we want them to do their jobs and stop the cuts.\"John Kelshaw who works with the Internal Revenue Service came to town from New Jersey. He and a few other federal workers met with Republican Representative John Runyan.\"We told him that a lot of our people live paycheck to paycheck. We said \\'Give us a break\\'\" Kelshaw said. He said Runyan of New Jersey listened but made no commitments.WHO\\'S TO BLAME?Polls so far show most Americans blame Republicans rather than Obama and his Democrats for the standoff. But that could change.Republicans insist that any deficit-reduction replacement deal include only spending cuts. Democrats want a mix of spending cuts and tax increases.According to a February 28 Gallup survey 56 percent of those polled thought the cuts will damage the economy. The feeling crossed party lines Gallup reported with 64 percent of Republicans and 51 percent of Democrats agreeing they would inflict economic pain.Democratic Senator Mark Pryor said his constituents in Arkansas routinely ask him \"\\'Why can\\'t you guys work it out?\\'\"Pryor said he tells them \"Nobody has clean hands on this.\"Both sides seem to size up any issue on a basis of who gets the political advantage he said. \"If someone suddenly came up with a cure to cancer the question in Washington would be \\'Is this good or bad for Obama?\\'\"The president on Friday said of the cuts \"This is not a win for anybody. This is a loss for the American people.\"Hatch of Utah said he recently told his state legislature that he expected the federal government to impose the sweeping cuts. \"A number of them stood up and said maybe that\\'s the only way we are going get any real reduction in spending\" he said.On the other side Representative Luis Gutierrez a Chicago Democrat who won an 11th term last year with more than 80 percent of the vote said his constituents \"tell me \\'Keep on fighting Luis keep on fighting.\\'\"Representative Scott Rigell a Virginia Republican whose district includes the shipbuilding yards in Newport News that are likely to be hit hard by cuts in military spending was dismayed by the untargeted reductions.Rigell got a letter from a constituent last month that read in part \"My husband a project manager for the defense industry went to work this morning to lay off half of his workforce because of sequestration.\"In an interview Rigell said \"When I think they (shipyard workers) could lose their jobs because of the dysfunction in Washington ... this is not acceptable to me.\"\"I\\'ve been at that shipyard.

       " 'Republicans on Saturday stepped up their call for President Obama to take the lead in negotiations to avert roughly $85 billion in automatic cuts to the military and other government spending next month by replacing the cuts with less drastic reductions.Alabama Republican Rep. Martha Roby said the president is responsible for the cuts because his administration proposed the plan known as sequester during the 2011 debt-limit negotiations.“In his State of the Union address President Obama himself admitted that these cuts are a really bad idea” Roby said Saturday in the weekly Republican address. “What the president failed to mention was sequester was his idea.”Roby chairwoman of a House Armed Services subcommittee is among several Republican lawmakers including Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn who after Obama\\'s speech Tuesday is saying how the across-the-board cuts to the military would impact bases including those in their home districts.Roby said her district’s Fort Rucker the Army’s primary flight-training base would lose 500 students training to be combat aviators.“The numbers are astounding” said Roby who voted against the August 2011 Budget Control Act. “This is just one set of cuts at one base.”The consequences of the sequester agreement were intended to be so drastic that the parties were expected to reach a deal before the cuts started.Roby is urging the president to consider two proposals by the Republican-controlled House that call for replacing sequester with more targeted cuts.However the March 1 deadline is fast approaching with no deal as the president is playing golf in Florida during the long President’s Day weekend and Congress is on a nine-day break.“Sequestration is going to take place” Blackburn told CNBC on Wednesday.Leaders of the Democrat-controlled Senate announced a plan Thursday to avoid the cuts. However the plan a mix of spending cuts and tax increases on the country’s highest earners is not expected to pass. It further highlights the continuing debate on whether to solve the country’s fiscal problems with less spending or more taxes.“I disagree with Republicans who think we should do that by making even bigger cuts to things like education and job training; Medicare and Social Security benefits” Obama said Saturday during his weekly address. “That would force our senior citizens and working families to bear the burden of deficit reduction while the wealthiest are asked to do nothing more.”Sequester would result in roughly $85 billion in cuts this year from the federal budget with $46 billion from the Pentagon. No so-called \"safety-net\" programs would be cut. But the economy could lose an estimate 750000 jobs as a result of sequester which cuts $1.2 trillion in spending over the next decade.“President Obama and Senate Democrats see sequester as another opportunity to push through another tax hike” Roby said. “The ink has barely dried on the tax hikes the president pushed through in January.”',\n",
       " 'At a press conference on Monday President Obama addressed the Benghazi talking points criticism and said “We don’t have time to be playing these kinds of political games here in Washington.” (The Washington Post)At a press conference on Monday President Obama addressed the Benghazi talking points criticism and said “We don’t have time to be playing these kinds of political games here in Washington.” (The Washington Post)After answering questions Monday morning about two of the controversies that have undermined his administration President Obama flew off to New York to raise money for the Democratic Party. There before partisan donors he reflected on his second term and said he will continue to reach out to Republicans. “I sure want to do some governing” he explained.Obama’s words suggest that he believes there is a way to compartmentalize the business of his second term: legislative and other business here scandals over there. But things are too messy for that right now. A politician who has counted good luck as part of his skill set will need all the breaks he can muster to pull off that bit of political jujitsu.Even in the best of times Obama’s outreach to Republicans produced little in return — and these are no longer close to the best of times. The question is whether the barely civil relationship between the White House and the opposition party has been irreparably damaged. A related question is how much the controversies will weaken Obama’s standing with the public. Together the answers will decide how effectively he can govern.It is too early to draw any broad conclusions about the long-term damage to Obama’s presidency from the news that the Internal Revenue Service targeted conservative groups and that the Justice Department collected two months of phone records from Associated Press reporters and editors. But in the moment these controversies — along with the ongoing congressional investigation of the attacks in Benghazi Libya — have created major challenges for the administration.The president and his advisers have tried to insulate the White House from the actions of the IRS and the Justice Department claiming ignorance. The IRS officials argued Friday is quasi-independent. It took the president three days to express his outrage at the agency’s actions. As for the Justice Department’s leak investigation White House officials said Monday night that it was a department decision that was not forwarded to the president.Those are temporary responses that probably will not be sufficient over time. The White House may have known nothing about either but both are now the president’s problem. And both reflect questions about the administration that predate the revelations of the past few days.The tea party movement has been a political nemesis for Obama since the first year of his presidency. The movement helped turn the battle over health care into one of the most divisive fights of his presidency. The political potency of the grass-roots activists who rallied behind tea party banners helped deliver the worst midterm-election defeat to a party holding the White House in 70 years.The president and his advisers may not have known anything about IRS targeting of tea party groups for greater scrutiny but the abuse of power confirmed complaints by conservatives and GOP lawmakers that the practice was taking place and impressions among conservatives that the administration is truly hostile to the tea party movement. Holding those responsible accountable will be only part of Obama’s challenge in responding.Less is known about the Justice Department’s leak investigation. It was carried out by an administration that came into office talking about the importance of civil liberties but whose record has been a disappointment to civil libertarians. No one can recall anything as far-reaching as what the Justice Department apparently did in secretly gathering information about the work of AP journalists.Obama showed his greatest passion Monday when he denounced the GOP-led inquiry of the killing of four Americans in a terrorist attack in Benghazi on Sept. 11 2012. That partisan politics are involved in the congressional investigation is certainly the case. In addition to whatever enmity is felt toward the Obama administration over its handling of the aftermath GOP leaders see former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton for what she is which is a potentially formidable presidential candidate in 2016.Obama argued that the current focus on administration talking points is a political sideshow. As others including The Post’s Glenn Kessler have noted the multiple alterations in those talking points appeared to reflect an internal turf war between the State Department and the CIA. Obama argued that it was hardly a coverup.Given the timing of the attack in Benghazi which occurred in the heat of a presidential race White House officials worked to keep the issue from becoming part of the campaign debate — and GOP nominee Mitt Romney’s maladroit handling of it at the start provided convenient cover for the White House. Obama’s campaign put Romney on the defensive rather than the opposite although the deaths of the four Americans — and the subsequent security lapses that were enumerated — were a major stain on the administration.As questions were raised White House officials avoided drawing conclusions about the origins of the attacks. Even as the head of the National Counterterrorism Center testified that what happened at the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi was a terrorist attack the president continued to resist labeling it as such. For whatever reason the administration’s semantic gamesmanship contributed to what the president now dismisses as a sideshow.Obama is early into his second term but it has not gone as planned. His gun-control initiative was blocked. Prospects for a grand bargain on the budget are problematic. Immigration reform is moving forward slowly in the Senate and faces uncertainty in the House although administration officials remain optimistic that Congress eventually will approve a bill.On Monday night in New York the president said “I’m going to do everything I can over the next 31 / 2 years to continue to reach out to my Republican friends on the other side of the aisle. . . . I want to get some stuff done. I don’t have a lot of time.”He will have to spend some of that precious time trying to clean up unexpected messes that have landed on his desk. How seriously off track his administration is will depend in large part on how skillfully Obama handles what is before him.',\n",
       " 'It’s past time for the media to begin asking President Obama tough questions about the IRS conservative targeting scandal. After all he was involved publicly from the beginning.Last Friday the American Center for Law and Justice (where I serve as Chief Counsel) filed its Second Amended Complaint against the United States the IRS and a legion of IRS officials. This Complaint in which we represent 41 organizations in 22 states presents perhaps the most complete story yet of the IRS conservative targeting scandal.And it is an ugly story indeed.What was sold to the American public as a low-level scandal perpetrated by a few rogue employees – a scandal stopped after senior officials became aware and asserted control – is now (to borrow a Watergate phrase) “no longer operative.”[pullquote]Instead we detail a long-running assault on the Tea Party beginning shortly after its emergence in 2009 that is empowered encouraged and orchestrated not only by senior IRS officials in Washington but also through outright targeting by the White House Congressional Democrats and the mainstream media.In fact the IRS was doing little more than focusing its attention exactly where the president of the United States told it to focus – on the groups the president himself identified as a “threat to democracy.”Consider President Obama’s aggressive public statements – made just as we now know senior IRS officials were intentionally and aggressively scrutinizing conservative groups’ applications for tax exemption.On August 9 2010 the president warned of “attack ads run by shadowy groups with harmless-sounding names” during his weekly radio address. The President said: We don’t know who’s behind these ads and we don’t know who’s paying for them . . . you don’t know if it’s a foreign controlled corporation. ... The only people who don’t want to disclose the truth are people with something to hide.”On September 16 2010 President Obama once again warned that some unidentified “foreign-controlled entity” could be providing “millions of dollars” for “attack ads.” Less than one week later he complained that “nobody knows” the identities of the individuals who support conservative groups.On September 22 2010 President Obama warned of groups opposing his policies “pos[ing] as non-for-profit social and welfare trade groups” and he claimed such groups were “guided by seasoned Republican political operatives” and potentially supported by some unidentified “foreign controlled entity.”On October 14 2010 President Obama called organizations with “benign sounding” names “a problem for democracy”; the next week he complained about individuals who “hide behind those front groups” called such groups a “threat to our democracy” and claimed such groups were engaged in “unsupervised” spending.Next consider the IRS’s actions following those statements. Not only did the IRS continue its targeting it issued broad questionnaires that made unconstitutionally-intrusive inquiries designed to get answers to exactly the questions President Obama posed.Who are your donors?What is the political activity of your family and associates?What are the passwords for your websites?After all according to the president you’re only afraid to answer these questions if “you’ve got something to hide.”The demagoguery is breathtaking. Not only does he raise the wholly-unsubstantiated possibility of shadowy “foreign” involvement in the Tea Party groups a charge incredible on its face but he goes the extra mile of calling such groups a “threat to our democracy.”When the president of the United States declares these groups a “threat to our democracy” is it any surprise that his enthusiastic supporters (and donors) within the IRS responded with an unprecedented campaign of selective targeting intimidation and governmental intrusion?One grows weary of stating the obvious but if President Bush had declared a specific category of citizen groups a “threat to democracy” potentially run by “political operatives” or “foreign-controlled” and the IRS launched an unprecedented campaign of targeting and intrusive questioning the mainstream media would have been relentless not only in its independent investigations but in its calls for accountability – at the highest levels.Was the president of the United States involved in the IRS scandal?

       " \"Republicans and conservative Democrats just voted to sell you out to Wall Street. In other words it's Tuesday.Today the House passed the so-called Retail Investor Protection Act 254 to 166. 30 Democrats voted with 224 Republicans in favor. 165 Democrats--and one Republican--voted against it. Those following H.R. 2374 thought it would pass with wide bipartisan margins so having 165 Democratic NAY's was better than expected. The 30 Democratic YEA's still need to be named and shamed however.First let's begin with the important question: What is the Retail Investor Protection Act? The bill delays a new Department of Labor rule that would prevent financial advisers from stealing from your 401(K) plans or IRAs. Allowing financial advisers to rip you off is a great complement to that other plank in the Republican-Conservadem retirement insecurity platform cutting Social Security.Here's David Dayen with more details:The Labor Department proposal known as the “fiduciary rule” would change the ethical standards by which employer-based retirement products like 401(k)’s and IRAs are marketed and sold. The rule has not been updated since 1975 before 401(k)’s and IRAs even existed. The Labor Department wants to broaden the definition of a “fiduciary” to cover all financial advisers who offer individual investment advice for a fee. Under the rule they would be legally required to work in the best interest of their clients. For example a fiduciary would not be able to push investment products on customers in which they have a financial stake. The agency defines the goal of the proposal as “to ensure that potential conflicts of interest among advisers are not allowed to compromise the quality of investment advice that millions of American workers rely on so they can retire with the dignity that they have worked hard to achieve.” ... Currently it is depressingly common for financial advisers more than 80 percent of whom are not fiduciaries to self-deal when offering advice. First off they obtain large fees from the retirement products they sell. According to the think tank Demos a median-income two-earner household will pay $155000 during their lifetime to financial advisers on average. (The lifetime gains for two-earner households from retirement accounts are around $230000 meaning that nearly two-thirds of the profits go to the industry.) Second non-fiduciary financial advisers can enjoy kickbacks; right now there is no rule against an adviser from a mutual fund company encouraging clients to put their money in specific funds sold by that company. In fact that’s the norm and the adviser typically receives a commission for the sale. Conflicts of interest like this cost retirement investors at least $1 billion a month because the funds they get channeled into underperform the alternatives. Financial advisers also encourage rollovers into high-cost IRAs when an individual changes jobs. None of these schemes have to be disclosed to the customer under the current standard. The National Bureau for Economic Research found in a recent study that “adviser self‐interest plays an important role in generating advice that is not in the best interest of the clients.” So in the middle of a retirement crisis when the majority of Americans already aren’t accumulating the savings they need to maintain their standard of living sellers of retirement products are skimming close to $60 billion a year off the top through deceptive practices making a bad situation even worse.Now that we know what it is let's move to the next question: Who voted for it?The lone Republican NO was Walter Jones (NC-03).And here are the 30 Democratic YEA votes. Most of their names should look familiar if you've seen any of my past roll call diaries.John Barrow (GA-12)John Carney (DE-AL)Gerry Connolly (VA-11)Jim Costa (CA-16)Henry Cuellar (TX-28)John Delaney (MD-06)Ted Deutch (FL-21)Bill Foster (IL-11)Pete Gallego (TX-23)Joe Garcia (FL-26)Denny Heck (WA-10)Jim Himes (CT-04)Derek Kilmer (WA-06)Ron Kind (WI-03)Rick Larsen (WA-02)Dan Maffei (NY-24)Jim Matheson (UT-04)Mike McIntyre (NC-07)Gwen Moore (WI-04)Patrick Murphy (FL-18)Bill Owens (NY-21)Ed Perlmuter (CO-07)Scott Peters (CA-52)Gary Peters (MI-09)Collin Peterson (MN-07)Bradley Schneider (IL-10)Kurt Schrader (OR-05)Brad Sherman (CA-30)Kyrsten Sinema (AZ-09)Filemon Vela (TX-34)Note the appearance of Gary Peters on the list.

       " 'Controversial Democrat Alan Grayson has set off a flurry of criticism from conservatives after the Florida congressman sent out a fundraising email to supporters in which he compared the tea party to the Ku Klux Klan.Grayson’s original comments came during a recent appearance on MSNBC’s “Politics Nation with Al Sharpton.” Grayson was discussing the tea party’s influence on the Republican Party when he said “At this point the tea party is no more popular than the Klan.”And rather than shy away from that comment Grayson included them in bold letters on his website with the quote taking readers directly to a fundraising page for Grayson’s re-election campaign.Grayson’s fundraising page includes the image of a burning cross; it uses the cross as the letter “T” and spells out “tea party” in flaming letters:\"As a black Tea Party activist I could say that there\\'s nothing more offensive than equating the Tea Party with the Ku Klux Klan” Jennifer Burke National Outreach Director for TheTeaParty.net said in a statement emailed to Yahoo News. “The hate speech uttered by sitting congressman Alan Grayson is deplorable even by the low levels reached in recent years when Democrats routinely call us racists and suicide bombers.\"Grayson’s comments were also criticized by the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).There’s no excuse for the hateful words and imagery used by Congressman Grayson” NRCC spokesman Matt Gorman said in a statement. “House Democrats should swiftly and strongly condemn him and return the money he has raised for them. This hate-filled rhetoric has Americans fed up with Washington.”Grayson is no stranger to controversy. First elected to Congress in 2008 he regularly was an outspoken critic of Republicans and conservatives in general. He was voted out of office after his first term and many observers expected him to take a role as an activist outside of government. However Grayson was re-elected in 2012 and is considered a strong favorite for re-election in 2014.Despite the criticism over his KKK comparison Grayson has stood by his comments and subsequent fundraising effort. He pointed to offensive comments and signage that appeared at past tea party rallies to justify his own comments.“Tea Party members have circulated countless altered pictures depicting President Obama and the First Lady as monkeys. Tea Party members also called my fellow Member of Congress civil rights hero John Lewis a ‘n***ger’ and Rep. Barney Frank a ‘faggot’” Grayson said in a statement. “One could go on and on because there is overwhelming evidence that the Tea Party is the home of bigotry and discrimination in America today just as the KKK was for an earlier generation.

       " 'The right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no Warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by Oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized. Fourth Amendment to the United States ConstitutionWhat this means is the government has to have \" information sufficient to warrant a prudent person\\'s belief that the wanted individual had committed a crime (for an arrest warrant) or that evidence of a crime or contraband would be found in a search (for a search warrant) \". A person walking down the street can\\'t be stopped or their house can\\'t be searched unless the police have a concrete reason to stop the person or search the house. The police have to go before a judge and explain their probable cause and if the judge agrees then a warrant is issued for a search or an arrest.Testing welfare recipients violates that principle because the government is searching a person without knowledge that the person is in fact taking drugs. The common saying is that it would be a \"fishing expedition\". Courts tend to frown on fishing expeditions.Even police at traffic stops for drug interdiction have to ask the driver for permission to search their vehicle and only if they refuse do they bring a dog in to sniff the outside of the car. If the dog gets a hit then the police have probable cause to search the car.As the ACLU states concerning drug testing for welfare recipients:The ACLU challenged the mandatory drug testing program as unconstitutional arguing that drug testing of welfare recipients violates the Fourth Amendment\\'s protection against unreasonable searches. The case Marchwinski v. Howard concluded when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit upheld a lower court\\'s decision striking down the policy as unconstitutional. In halting the implementation of Michigan\\'s drug testing law U.S. District Court Judge Victoria Roberts ruled that the state\\'s rationale for testing welfare recipients \"could be used for testing the parents of all children who received Medicaid State Emergency Relief educational grants or loans public education or any other benefit from that State.\"[18] Indeed any of the justifications put forth to subject welfare recipients to random drug testing would also by logical extension apply to the entirety of our population that receives some public benefit and/or that is a parent. It is clear that our constitution – and common sense – would object to the random drug testing of this large group of people making the drug testing of an equally absurd category of people – welfare recipients – unconstitutional as well. Drug Testing of Public Assistance Recipients as a Condition of EligibilityBut Doug you are saying I got tested before I got hired at my job? Fair is fair right?The ACLU also is opposed to pre-employment drug testing but sometimes people forget our Bill of Rights don\\'t always apply to private businesses.The court has read the Fourth Amendment to prohibit only those government searches or seizures that are \"unreasonable.\" Because of this businesses that are in an industry that is \"closely regulated\" can be searched more frequently and can be searched without a warrant. In one case an auto parts dealer at a junkyard was charged with receiving stolen auto parts. Part of his defense was to claim that the search that found incriminating evidence was unconstitutional. But the court found the search reasonable because the dealer was in a \"closely regulated industry.\" Note again that constitutional guarantees like the Fourth Amendment apply to governmental action. Your employer or any private enterprise is not bound by constitutional limits. For example if drug testing of all employees every week is done by government agency the employees may have a cause of action to object based on the Fourth Amendment. However if a private employer begins the same kind of routine drug testing employees have no constitutional arguments to make; they can simply leave that employer or they may pursue whatever statutory or common-law remedies are available. Introduction to the Law of Property Estate Planning and Insurance (4.5 Business and the Bill of Rights)It is kind of ironic that some of the same friends supporting random drug testing of poor people are the same ones who objected when the story about employers asking for Facebook passwords came out . They claimed the same arguments I\\'m using here against drug testing to oppose giving up their passwords. I don\\'t see the difference between drug testing and giving up passwords although the 4th amendment is stronger for drug testing than giving up passwords.I haven\\'t even addressed the fact that drug testing of poor people is both a waste of tax dollars and only catches a insignificant number of drug users.The state of Florida passed an almost identical testing procedure that ran from 1999 to 2001 and was reintroduced in July of 2011 that was struck down by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta the following month citing the fact: \"there is nothing inherent to the condition of being impoverished that supports the conclusion that there is a `concrete danger\\' that impoverished individuals are prone to drug use.\" The Tampa Tribune investigated the results of those July 2011 drug tests and found that \"96 percent proved to be drug free\" another 2 percent never bothering to complete the lengthy application process and 2 percent actually failing drug testing. At an average cost of $30 per test the state was hemorrhaging tax dollars at a rate of \"$28800-$43200 monthly\"... FAR out pacing the supposed \"savings\" from preventing drug-abusers from gaming the system to buy drugs. Texas Senate Unanimously Votes to Drug Test Welfare ApplicantsDrug testing is expensive. The average cost of a drug test is about $42 per person tested[8] not including the costs of hiring personnel to administer the tests to ensure confidentiality of results and to run confirmatory tests to guard against false positives resulting from passive drug exposure cross-identification with legal prescription drugs such as codeine and legal substances such as poppy seeds.Another way to measure the cost is by counting what it costs to \"catch\" each drug user. Drug testing is not used by many private employers because of the exorbitant cost of catching each person who tests positive. One electronics manufacturer for example estimated that the cost of finding each person who tested positive was $20000 since after testing 10000 employees only 49 tested positive. A congressional committee also estimated that the cost of each positive drug test of government employees was $77000 because the positive rate was only 0.5%.[9] Mandatory drug testing is an ineffective means to uncover drug abuse. An Oklahoma study found that a questionnaire was able to accurately detect 94 out of 100 drug abusers. The questionnaire was also useful in detecting alcohol abusers something drug tests fail to accomplish.[10]Certain counties in Oregon experimented with drug testing on some welfare recipients but the process was halted when it was found that drug testing was less effective in identifying drug abuse than less invasive cheaper methods.[11]Most types of drug tests fail to detect alcohol abuse – the most commonly abused substance among Americans – and are most likely to detect marijuana use since the active ingredient in marijuana stays in the body\\'s system longer than any other illicit substance. Therefore drug tests often fail to identify people who are using more powerful more addictive and more dangerous drugs like methamphetamine or cocaine which exit the body\\'s system in a matter of hours or days.[12] Many states have rejected the random drug testing of welfare recipients as impractical and fiscally unjustifiable. For example New York and Maryland each considered a program to randomly drug test those receiving welfare but abandoned the plan as not cost-effective given that urinalysis is almost exclusively a barometer of marijuana use and that welfare recipients are required to undergo regular supervision allowing for effective monitoring absent the cost and intrusion of mandatory drug testing.[13]Louisiana passed a law in 1997 requiring drug testing for welfare recipients. However a task force set up to implement the law found more limited drug testing of individuals identified by a questionnaire to be more cost-effective than mandatory drug testing.[14]Alabama decided against drug testing because it found that focusing on job training programs was a more effective method of moving individuals off of welfare.[15] Drug Testing of Public Assistance Recipients as a Condition of EligibilitySen. Tim Schaffer plans to introduce legislation today that would establish a drug-testing pilot program for Ohio Works First applicants. \"It is time that we recognize that many families are trying to survive in drug-induced poverty and we have an obligation to make sure taxpayer money is not being used to support drug dealers\" Schaffer said. \"We can no longer turn a blind eye to this problem.\" The proposal comes as Ohio\\'s public welfare rolls are at their lowest levels in decades. As of June slightly fewer than 25000 adults received cash assistance. Children who make up the bulk of recipients about 107000 would be exempt from drug testing under Schaffer\\'s proposal. Schaffer R-Lancaster said he hopes to avoid similar lawsuits by requiring applicants to be tested only if they indicate on a questionnaire that they have used drugs in the past six months. Michigan\\'s drug-testing law he said was found unconstitutional because it required all applicants to undergo screenings regardless of whether there was reason to believe they were using illegal drugs. Drug tests for welfare pushedOhio State Senator Tim Schaffer (R) has decided again that Ohio needs drug testing. He still doesn\\'t know how public assistance works but he is reaching to show his bigoted constituents he can punch a poor person like a good Republican:There must be an election coming up. That\\'s when we get these silly \"bash the poor\" laws. The simple fact is most people who have little to no money don\\'t buy drugs and the idea that all welfare recipients use drugs is not supported by the evidence. It is a bigoted idea and drug testing is unconstitutional.Thanks for putting this post on the rec list. I appreciate it and the good comments I\\'ve been reading. -- dlbOriginally published on Doug\\'s Views',\n",
       " 'Commuters at the Judiciary Square Metro station walk past a new ad billboard calling for jurors to rule for jury nullification on Oct. 24 in Washington. (Marlon Correa/The Washington Post)The illuminated billboard in the Judiciary Square Metro station near the F Street entrance was strategically placed.Prospective jurors who take the subway to D.C. Superior Court and exit near the National Building Museum see these words: “Good jurors nullify bad laws” and “You have the right to ‘hang’ the jury with your vote if you cannot agree with other jurors.”Since the billboard went up this month District prosecutors have been worried that the message could sway their cases. In the past week alone they have asked judges in three \\xadcases to ensure that jurors had neither seen nor been influenced by the billboard.The billboard is part of a growing national campaign to encourage jurors who disagree with a law or think a punishment is too harsh to vote for acquittal. Kirsten Tynan of the Montana-based Fully Informed Jury Association whose name and Web address is included on the billboard said the nonprofit group generally challenges crimes it calls “victimless” such as vandalism by graffiti or gun possession.James Babb a Philadelphia-based graphics artist who organized a fundraising campaign to put up the billboard said he raised $3000 in about a week through Facebook and other \\xadsocial-media sites. He said he is concerned about laws that he thinks are too restrictive.“People are going to jail for weed” Babb said. “Things are getting so weird. There needs to be this final safeguard to protect us from a tyrannical government.”Babb’s group has added a similar message on two pillars in Archives station another Metro stop near the courthouse. Both displays are scheduled to be up for about a month. Babb said he also plans to place signs in other cities including Chicago and Los Angeles.Supporters of jury nullification in several cities have raised the ire of judges and prosecutors. In New York last year an 80-year-old man was charged with jury tampering after passing out fliers about jury nullification to courthouse visitors; the case was later dismissed by a federal judge.Locally prosecutors have been scrambling to ensure that the billboard’s message doesn’t influence their \\xadcases.In a gang-related murder trial set to begin this week prosecutors filed a motion asking the judge to question potential jurors about whether they had seen the billboard. They also requested that the judge remind jurors that their verdict should not be influenced by whether they agree or disagree with the law.In their memo prosecutors Todd Gee and Emily Miller wrote that jurors who see the billboard may think “they don’t have to abide by an oath” and that it could encourage them “to hang and to learn about the concept of jury nullification.”In another recent murder case the jury had already been sworn in and the trial was underway when prosecutors alerted Superior Court Judge Herbert Dixon to the billboard. Dixon according to people familiar with the case then asked the jurors if they had seen the billboard. No one said they had.Days later the jury found the defendant Grant Johnson 39 of Bladensburg Md. guilty of first-degree murder in the slaying of 32-year-old Ricardo Lancaster during a drug deal in 2012 prosecutors said.And in a trial involving an assault with a deadly weapon Assistant U.S. Attorney Brittain Shaw asked the judge to question potential jurors about the billboard. Days later the jury found the defendant Charles Link 53 guilty in a knife attack in November that left one man injured.The billboard also comes as Adam Kokesh a Fairfax County-based gun rights activist is preparing to go to trial after posting an Independence Day video on YouTube of himself apparently loading a shotgun in Freedom Plaza. He had been scheduled to go to trial Thursday but the case was pushed back to at least Nov. 18.Kokesh’s supporters have advocated for jury nullification in his case.Tynan said the Metro billboard was not directly aimed at the Kokesh who pleaded not guilty to carrying a pistol without a license but she said that his case was the kind her organization targeted. “It’s a victimless trial” Tynan said.A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office said there has been no organized effort by prosecutors to address the billboard but instead prosecutors have raised the issue on a case-by-case basis.“Jurors in the District of Columbia play an important role in holding accountable the criminals who threaten and harm the people who live work and visit our city” U.S. Attorney Ronald C. Machen Jr. said in a statement. But he added “Jurors who ignore the law or refuse to follow the judge’s instructions embolden criminals who believe that they can get away with breaking the law and do harm to the community without any repercussion.”',\n",
       " \"The Ohio State Senate held a second hearing Thursday night on a proposal to establish pilot drug-testing programs in three counties. Under the proposal applicants would be required to submit a drug test if they disclose that they have used illegal substances. The proposal was first introduced in the spring but pressure from opponents led Gov. John Kasich to squash the bill in May. Virginia Republicans are also reviving a bill that was shelved earlier this year. The 2012 version failed after the state estimated it would cost $1.5 million to implement while only saving $229000. The bill’s sponsor Delegate Dickie Bell has not introduced the updated version yet but says he’s found more cost effective options.Looking at the range of drug testing-for-benefits bills being pushed in state legislatures across the country you almost have to suspect Republicans of some kind of urine fetish. In addition to all the states that are debating or have passed bills requiring people applying for unemployment insurance benefits to pee in cups drug-testing bills aimed at welfare applicants are being introduced in three states. The specifics would be ripe for comedy if we weren't talking about a concerted effort by the powerful to stigmatize vulnerable people as drug addicts as if that's the only reason a person might need help in an economy in which there are still more than three job-seekers for every job opening:Those would have to be some pretty damn significant changes to the cost structure to erase a nearly $1.25 million deficit. Virginia wasn't the first to run into that kind of problem; a Florida law mandating drug-testing of welfare applicants cost the state money because so few people's tests were positive leaving the cost of the tests higher than the savings from denying people benefits. And that's leaving aside the cost of the lawsuits for a law that was ultimately found unconstitutional.Both Ohio and Kansas legislators are trying to pretend the goal is to help people rather than to associate welfare recipients with drug abuse in the public debate claiming that they just want to be sure people get the help they need. Bear in mind that in Florida just 2.6 percent of applicants didn't pass their drug tests. So when you have Republican legislators who don't show any signs of wanting to help any kind of working-class or middle-class people even suddenly dripping with concern for welfare applicants ... well you just have to call bullshit.\",\n",
       " 'On Sept. 12 religious-liberty leaders met with Pentagon officials to discuss the rapidly-escalating incidents of religious-liberty violations in the military under the Obama administration.On Apr. 28 Breitbart News broke the story of Pentagon brass meeting with anti-Christian activist Mikey Weinstein to discuss religious-liberty policies. Quoting Weinstein in his own printed words this activist has a record of calling observant Christians “fundamentalist monsters” who seek impose “theocratic terror” on America and that evangelizing (sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ) in the military is an act of “sedition and treason” against this country making those who do it “enemies of the Constitution.” He says those who do so should be court-martialed (criminally prosecuted).As this story developed the Obama-Hagel Pentagon defended its policy and changed its story several times as it was revealed that these meetings with Weinstein had been going on for years. In the following months there were additional incidents such as removing Christian patriotic artwork at a military base censoring a Christian chaplain and a Christian service member reportedly being relieved of duty by his lesbian commander because he refused her order to say that it is wrong not to support gay marriage.Now leaders from Restore Military Religious Freedom–a coalition to protect service members of faith–met with Pentagon officials. Lt. Gen. Jerry Boykin (ret.) of the Family Research Council Col. Ron Crews (ret.) of the Chaplains Alliance for Religious Liberty Kellie Fiedorek of the Alliance Defending Freedom and nationally-known Christian talk radio host Sandy Rios took with them two petitions calling on Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to protect religious liberty. One was a general petition with 170000 signatures and the other–with 50000 signatures–was sparked by the last incident mentioned above where Air Force Senior Master Sergeant Phillip Monk was relieved of duty by Maj. Elisa Valenzuela allegedly because of Monk’s Christian beliefs on marriage. Monk now faces possible court martial.These Christian leaders met with Lt. Gen. Richard C. Harding the three-star judge advocate general of the Air Force (the top lawyer in that branch of the military) and Maj. Gen. Howard D. Stendahl the two-star Air Force chief of chaplains.Gen. Boykin said after the meeting:The meeting included a productive discussion on the issue of religious freedom in the military as a whole and not just the U.S. Air Force. After delivering the petitions we explained our concerns regarding the trend towards infringements on the constitutional liberties of service members in all uniformed services. We appreciate their offer to review decisions that do not reflect Air Force policy made by commanders at various bases. At their request we will report future events and concerns directly to Air Force leadership. After reviewing a series of troubling incidents involving chaplains the coalition members were assured in the meeting that chaplains would not be forced to do anything that violates the tenets of their faith. We also requested that the Department of Defense and the Air Force issue a definitive statement regarding the ability of service members to share their faith publicly. Previous statements on the subject have been confusing and contradictory. Additionally we asked that the Department of Defense move quickly to implement the religious freedom protections enacted in last year’s National Defense Authorization Act. Given new incidents of military personnel facing career reprisals for their religious beliefs it is vital that regulations preventing discrimination be issued by the Secretary of Defense as demanded by law. We intend to remain in contact with the Air Force to ensure that the law’s implementation is consistent with the intent of Congress.Congress is working on new statutory language to protect such religious speech in the military which has passed the House and is pending in the Senate. President Obama threatens to veto this legislation.Breitbart News legal columnist Ken Klukowski is on faculty at Liberty University School of Law. Follow him on Twitter @kenklukowski.',\n",

Here are some photos of McDonnell’s time in office as his four-year term comes to a close.Federal prosecutors told Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell last week that he and his wife would be charged in connection with a gift scandal but senior Justice Department officials delayed the decision after the McDonnells’ attorneys made a face-to-face appeal in Washington according to people familiar with the case.Dana J. Boente the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia told the McDonnells’ legal teams that he planned to ask a grand jury to return an indictment no later than this past Monday people familiar with the conversations said.McDonnell (R) and his wife Maureen would have been charged with working together to illegally promote a struggling dietary-supplement company in exchange for gifts and loans from its chief executive the people said.The plan to seek the felony charges this week changed however after attorneys for the state’s first couple met with Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole on Dec. 12.The attorneys argued that the governor had done nothing improper to assist businessman Jonnie R. Williams Sr. In particular they focused on the credibility of a key witness said a person familiar with the presentation. They also argued that if prosecutors proceeded with charges they should wait until after McDonnell left office Jan. 11 to allow a smooth transition of power to Gov.-elect Terry McAuliffe (D).Some element of the lawyers’ arguments apparently persuaded the Justice Department to delay according to people with knowledge of the case. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case.On Friday the day after the meeting McDonnell’s attorneys were told that the decision would be put on hold the people said. A final decision about whether to press charges is now not expected before Jan. 2 and could come as late as February they said.Jason Miyares a spokesman for McDonnell’s legal team and William A. Burck an attorney for McDonnell’s wife declined to comment. Boente and a spokesman for the Justice Department also declined to comment. McDonnell has maintained that he has done nothing wrong.It is not unusual that a high-profile target especially a sitting governor would be allowed a chance to appeal a U.S. attorney’s charging decision to top officials of the Justice Department. It would be very rare however for the Justice Department to ultimately overturn a decision made by a U.S. attorney.Relationship probedFederal prosecutors have been investigating the McDonnells’ relationship with Williams for most of this year. Williams provided more than $165000 in gifts and loans to the governor and his family. The gifts came as the McDonnells took steps to promote Williams’s company Star Scientific Inc. including hosting a lunch at the Executive Mansion to mark the launch of a new product. The McDonnells also helped company executives secure meetings with state officials.McDonnell has apologized for the relationship but he insisted that he treated Star just as he would have any other Virginia-based business. The company received no state grants contracts or board appointments.He has said in several recent interviews that he would like to see the investigation concluded as quickly as possible.“I’m hoping it will all be resolved in the very near future” he told The Washington Post last month.But privately as prosecutors signaled their intent to file charges McDonnell’s attorneys have been pressing Justice Department officials to reconsider or delay — at least long enough for McDonnell to complete his four-year term and avoid becoming the first sitting governor in state history to face criminal charges.The investigation has focused on whether McDonnell violated the Hobbs Act which makes it a federal crime for a public official to receive payments or other financial gifts knowing that those payments are in return for the official’s promise to take action in his government role.To prove the crime it is not necessary to show that the public official actually took the steps or that any of the official acts resulted in benefits to the person making the payments. Private citizens can also be charged under the law if they caused the public official to take actions or make such promises.McDonnell is also the subject of a state investigation into whether his annual financial disclosures complied with Virginia law. It is a misdemeanor under Virginia law for an elected official to knowingly submit false or incomplete information on annual financial disclosure forms.McDonnell has said he complied with state law which allows elected officials to accept gifts of any value provided they disclose those worth more than $50; they are not required to disclose gifts to their families or loans to their businesses.Attorneys working for Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II (R) learned in March 2012 of allegations that McDonnell’s forms might be incomplete. As required by law Cuccinelli designated a local prosecutor to conduct a full investigation turning the case over to Richmond Commonwealth’s Attorney Michael Herring in November 2012.But Virginia law requires prosecutors to press charges within a year of being alerted to possible legal violations. That statute of limitations is expiring which has become a factor in both the state and federal investigations.Herring had reached an agreement with McDonnell’s attorneys to extend the statute of limitations into this month said a person familiar with its terms. But the state probe has been on hold while federal prosecutors decided whether to proceed with more serious felony charges and federal prosecutors felt pressured by the looming state deadline the person said.On Friday all sides agreed to extend the deal on the state charges — known as a tolling agreement — into early February. That allows more time for federal authorities to make a final decision.Herring would not comment on the federal probe other than to say that he is “awaiting a final decision from the Justice Department.”“But” he added “I have to plan for other contingencies as well such as the matter being returned back to my office.” Herring would not provide information on the tolling agreement.Witnesses at issueThe McDonnells’ attorneys argued to the Justice Department last week that key witnesses were problematic a person close to the case said.Among other issues the attorneys have been telling federal prosecutors that there could be weaknesses in the testimony of Mary Shea Sutherland the former chief of staff to Maureen McDonnell.E-mails obtained under a freedom of information request show that Sutherland was intimately involved in the planning of an event held at the governor’s mansion in August 2011 that marked the launch of a Star Scientific dietary supplement called Anatabloc.Prosecutors believe that the luncheon event was one way the couple helped Williams’s company people with knowledge of the case said.Attorneys for the McDonnells have argued that they could convince a jury that Sutherland was trying to curry favor with Williams including by helping to organize the mansion event according to a person close to the case.Sutherland corresponded with Star Scientific executives before the company issued a news release touting the event. She also urged the governor’s scheduler to ensure that the governor attended. When the scheduler suggested that McDonnell might be busy Sutherland wrote back “The [first lady] isn’t going to be happy about it.”In that same time frame Sutherland was given an expensive dress by Williams on a New York City shopping trip during which Williams also bought $15000 in high-end clothing for the first lady the people said.The defense attorneys also point to a draft of a 2011 contract they said shows that Williams and Sutherland were in negotiations for Sutherland to leave her government job and work for Williams through an independent event planning firm.The employment contract was never executed. Ted Bruns an attorney for Sutherland declined to comment. He has previously said Sutherland never worked for Williams and has called the idea that Sutherland attended a Star event without the first lady’s knowledge “curious.”The event was held at the governor’s 200-year-old official residence and the first lady served as host. The governor attended as well. It was paid for by the governor’s political action committee.Asked about the Star Scientific mansion event in March a spokesman for the governor said all requests for use of the mansion are approved by the governor’s chief of staff. “The decision to have the event was based solely on the benefit to the Commonwealth” spokesman Jeff Caldwell said in a statement then.Matt Zapotosky contributed to this report.',\n",

       " \"Benjamin Jealous says if Republicans want to draw black votes addressing inequities of mass incarceration is a place to start.Story highlights Benjamin Jealous: Rand Paul's attempt to heal rift between blacks and GOP fell short He says if GOP wants to draw black votes it can start by committing to civil rights One way is criminal justice reform Jealous says Jealous: Sentencing reform education would bring down spending. GOP get on boardEditor’s Note: Benjamin Todd Jealous is president and CEO of the NAACP.(CNN) —Earlier this month Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) visited Howard University to take a swing at repairing relations between African Americans and the Republican Party.As famed sportscaster Harry Kalas would have said it was largely a swing and a miss.Paul struck out when he tried to equate today’s Republican Party with the party of Abraham Lincoln while ignoring much of the 150 years in between. (He even acknowledged his mistakes shortly after). But his willingness to step up to the plate can provide a lesson for a GOP struggling to get on top.Republicans will not win black votes by paying lip service to party history while attacking social programs and voting rights. But they can make inroads by showing a commitment to civil rights something Paul managed to do briefly in his remarks.Paul received applause when he told the Howard crowd “We should not have drug laws or a court system that disproportionately punishes the black community.” He illustrated using one issue where the GOP can connect with black voters: criminal justice reform.Benjamin Todd JealousJust before the 2012 elections the NAACP took a nonpartisan survey of black voters in key swing states. We found that 55% of African Americans believe Republicans “don’t care at all about civil rights” while another 32% think the party “just says what minorities want to hear.” But 14% said they would be more likely to vote for a Republican in the future if they found a candidate who demonstrated a strong commitment to civil rights.Mass incarceration is a fundamental civil rights issue. African Americans make up 40% of the 2.4 million people in America’s bloated prison system. That includes the vast majority of those in prison for nonviolent drug offenses. If current trends continue one in three black males born today can expect to spend time in prison during his life.As Paul demonstrated mass incarceration is also a fundamental conservative issue. State spending on prisons has tripled over the last 30 years reaching $70 billion in 2008. Federal prisons are at 139% capacity often thanks to harsh mandatory minimum sentences. And who pays for all these guards beds and three square meals a day? Taxpayers.In fact some red states have led the way on criminal justice reform. In Georgia South Carolina and Texas Republican legislatures have teamed up with progressives to increase options for parole and reduce mandatory minimums. In Texas the NAACP and progressive activists worked with leaders of the Tea Party to pass a dozen reform measures. Last year Texas scheduled the first prison closure in state history.Get our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and FacebookRand Paul is not the first national Republican leader to speak up either. Newt Gingrich and Jeb Bush are both members of the conservative think tank Right on Crime. And in 2011 Gingrich joined Grover Norquist and other unlikely allies - including Mike Jiminez the president of California’s prison guard union – to endorse the NAACP’s report Misplaced Priorities: Over Incarcerate Under Educate. The report revealed how the rise in prison spending has caused states to spend less on education.These alliances should draw the attention of Republican leaders. Many Democrats shy away from talking about criminal justice reform for fear of being labeled “soft on crime.” According to the NAACP’s election survey 42% of African American voters believe the Democratic Party is failing them on criminal justice. The GOP has a chance to fill the leadership vacuum and demonstrate their civil rights bona fides.Paul is poised to lead the conversation on criminal justice reform. At Howard he touted the “Justice Safety Valve Act of 2013” which he recently introduced with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy the Democratic senator from Vermont. The bill would allow federal judges to bypass federal mandatory minimum sentences if the sentence is too lengthy or if it simply does not fit the crime.Paul told students that his friends called him “either brave or crazy” for showing up at Howard University a statement that says more about his friends than the audience at Howard. Nonetheless Paul and his Republican Party would display true bravery and political savvy by taking this opportunity to walk Lincoln’s walk and take on the new Jim Crow.Moving from “tough on crime” to “smart on crime” would be good for this country. It would also be a smart move for the Republican Party if they ever hope to get on base with black voters.Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Benjamin Todd Jealous.\",\n",

       " \"This week many publications focused on the need to close the indefinite detention center at Guantanamo Bay and the ongoing hunger strikes there.From The Nation:“I don’t want these individuals to die” Obama told reporters on April 30 adding that “the Pentagon is trying to manage the situation as best as they can.” He also recommitted to closing Guantánamo calling on Congress to “step up and help.” It’s true that lawmakers on both sides have fought hard to make transfers impossible. But Obama’s words ignored how his own policies set the stage for the crisis. “He has said the right thing before” Guantánamo lawyer Pardiss Kebriaei of the Center for Constitutional Rights told The Nation. “It’s time now for action.” The CCR is calling on Obama to end his “self-imposed moratorium” on releasing Yemenis and resume prisoner transfers. It has also called for Obama to appoint a senior official to “shepherd the process of closure.” As the hunger strike approaches its hundredth day on May 17 more than 100 of Guantánamo’s 166 prisoners are refusing food. The president must start living up to his rhetoric about closing the prison the CCR warns or “the men who are on hunger strike will die and he will be ultimately responsible for their deaths.”Some progress has been made. The detainee population is down to 166 from a peak of nearly 800. Of the prisoners who remain 46 are deemed too dangerous to let go but impossible to prosecute even under the looser standards of military commissions for lack of evidence or because evidence is compromised by torture. If released or repatriated there's a high probability they'd resume jihad. What to do with this group — prisoners of war in a war without end — is a question with no satisfactory answer. They have to be held. But both Obama and Congress could do more to winnow down the rest including 86 prisoners cleared for transfer three years ago who remain incarcerated. If Obama is still serious about closing Guantanamo there are obvious steps he can take many without congressional assent.More analysis below the fold.\",\n",

       " 'With the government shutdown finally concluded the threat of a strike on Syria on the back burner and no serious chance that the U.S. will default on its debts for at least the next 3 1/2 months perhaps Congress can pull itself together and get back to work on stalled legislation. It should begin by tackling comprehensive immigration reform.After all much of the heavy lifting on this complicated and controversial issue has been done. Earlier this year the Senate passed a sweeping bipartisan bill that calls for allowing more high-skilled and low-skilled workers into the U.S. while also establishing a new guest-worker program that includes additional protections for farm workers. It would set out a 13-year path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally but only after they paid fines and passed a background check and after additional border security measures were put in place. It’s not a perfect plan but it takes the kind of broad approach that is needed to restructure the dysfunctional system.The Republican-led House however has not signed on opting instead for a piecemeal approach. Among the separate proposals waiting to reach the floor are an enforcement bill known as the SAFE Act which would for the first time designate as criminals all immigrants in the U.S. illegally and would allow states such as Arizona to enforce their own immigration laws. Another bill would create a new guest-worker program that would likely please growers but leave farm laborers unprotected from abusive employers. Two other bills would expand the use of federal databases to verify the immigration status of new employees.The two sides are far apart obviously. But there is some reason for hope after months of stalemate. In an effort to repair some of the political damage the GOP inflicted on itself during the shutdown some House Republicans apparently are calling for action on immigration reform to win back moderate support. If the House approved just one of its piecemeal bills it could move to a conference committee where Senate and House members could begin to reconcile their differences. If it goes that route the House should pass its border security measure which is the best of the bills introduced so far. But it’s unclear whether Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) will allow any of the bills to move forward.AdvertisementThe reality is that the current immigration system isn’t working for American employers who rely on the low-wage labor that comes in over the border or for the millions of immigrants stuck in the underground economy. That’s why a broad coalition of religious law enforcement and business leaders has repeatedly called for a compromise.Immigration reform can still be achieved if only GOP lawmakers stop stalling stop grandstanding and get to work.',\n",
       " 'At an immigration reform rally in San Francisco Monday President Obama confronted a heckler who demanded that he stop all deportations. (Associated Press)At an immigration reform rally in San Francisco Monday President Obama confronted a heckler who demanded that he stop all deportations. (Associated Press)The young man’s plea was direct: Stop the deportations he urged President Obama of the 11.5 million illegal immigrants in the United States.“You have the power to stop deportations for all” the man said as he interrupted Obama’s immigration policy speech here Monday afternoon.“Actually” the president replied “I don’t. And that’s why we’re here.”He added “The easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws. And what I’m proposing is the harder path which is to use our democratic processes to achieve the same goal that you want to achieve — but it won’t be as easy as just shouting. It requires us lobbying and getting it done.”Hecklers have become a staple at Obama’s public events but it’s rare that one underscores the message that the president is trying to deliver — in this instance that the American people support a path to citizenship for those here illegally but that Congress is blocking comprehensive immigration reform.Obama came to San Francisco’s Chinatown on Monday to argue that overhauling the immigration system would bring an economic windfall for the Bay Area and other communities nationwide. In remarks at the Betty Ann Ong Chinese Recreation Center Obama said 35 percent of business owners in San Francisco are immigrants many of them Asian Americans.“You don’t have to be an economist to figure out that workers will be more productive if they’ve got their families here with them — they’re not worried about deportation they’re not living halfway around the world” Obama said. “This isn’t just the right thing to do. It’s the smart thing to do.”Obama urged House Republicans to take up the Senate’s compromise immigration bill saying that progress on this front is being held up by a faction of the Republican Party. He also reiterated his support for a piecemeal approach in the House if that is what it would take to pass a package of reforms.But Obama also said “Just because something is smart fair good for the economy and supported by business labor law enforcement and faith leaders Democratic and Republican governors including the governor of this state — just because all that is in place doesn’t mean we’ll actually get it done because this is Washington after all that we’re talking about and everything’s looked at through a political prism.”Brendan Buck a spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said “The speaker is sincere in wanting to get something done and we’re pleased the president said he can accept the step-by-step approach we’re taking in the House.”In addition to immigration Obama touched briefly on the troubled rollout of the federal government’s health insurance exchange. California has signed up tens of thousands of people through its own exchange.“Even as we’re getting this darn Web site up to speed — and it’s getting better — states like California are proving the law works” Obama said referring to the federal insurance Web site.',\n",
       " 'Last year when the Supreme Court struck down the noxious Arizona law known as SB 1070 it sent a clear message to states seeking to enact their own immigration laws: Don’t do it.The court ruled that the law which in effect sought to bully undocumented immigrants into leaving the state was an unconstitutional intrusion by a state government into an arena — immigration policy — that is the responsibility of the federal government.But apparently the high court’s decision has done little to diminish support for such laws in Hazleton Pa. and Farmers Branch Texas where officials have spent millions defiantly defending local housing ordinances intended to regulate immigration.In Hazleton’s case the city adopted an ordinance in 2006 that would have turned landlords into criminals if they rented to immigrants lacking legal status. Two courts including the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals have struck down the measure finding it both discriminatory and an infringement on the federal government’s sole authority over immigration.AdvertisementAnd an en banc review by the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals found that the Farmers Branch law which required city officials to deny “occupancy licenses” to renters if it was found they were in the country illegally similarly interfered with the federal government’s authority.Now both cities are asking the Supreme Court to review the lower-court decisions that invalidated their ordinances. Supporters argue that these laws regulate housing not immigration and therefore do not interfere with federal authority. They cite a Nebraska law allowing such housing restrictions that was upheld this year by a circuit court.That argument is specious. Laws that punish immigrants who are in the country illegally for trying to find a place to live or that require landlords to check the immigration status of prospective tenants or that mandate that renters register with the city and provide proof of their legal status are clearly intended to regulate immigration. In fact these laws rely on the same “attrition by enforcement” strategy that Arizona employed when it tried to force immigrants out of the state by making their day-to-day lives so harsh that they would self-deport.Local regulations certainly can and do interfere with the federal government’s authority. As District Judge James Munley wrote in 2007 when he struck down Hazleton’s ordinance it “is difficult to conceive of a more effective method of ensuring that persons do not enter or remain in a locality than by precluding their ability to live in a place.” If the federal government is to have authority over who stays and who is deported it must have that power in every state and city.AdvertisementThe Supreme Court should deny both cities’ requests for review and in so doing remind local officials that immigration reform is Congress’ job — if only lawmakers would step up and do it.',\n",

       " 'Alan GomezUSA TODAYGround is %22fertile%22 for immigration revisions when Congress returns in 2014Republicans have said immigration legislation is a priority in the new yearHowever%2C some Republicans in the House still opposed to amnestyWASHINGTON — If the Senate manages to pass a long-term budget deal Tuesday the next item on the agenda for Congress could be even harder: immigration.Republican leaders led by House Speaker John Boehner R-Ohio have deemed immigration legislation a priority in the new year. The Senate is expected to pass Tuesday a bipartisan budget deal for the next two years that would clear the legislative calendar and eliminate the threat of a government shutdown in January. And even Bob Dane whose Federation for American Immigration Reform strongly opposes a bill concedes that at this point \"the ground is very fertile\" for an immigration bill.\"It\\'s going to happen\" Vice President Biden said during a webinar last week.However whether that momentum leads to a sweeping rewrite of the nation\\'s immigration laws could have more to do with the 2014 elections than current conditions.The biggest roadblock to legislation has been and will continue to be Republicans in the House who oppose a deal similar to that passed by the Senate allowing the nation\\'s 12 million undocumented immigrants to apply for U.S. citizenship. Dane says an already-fractured GOP must stand firm in opposition if it wants to have any success come election day.\"Opposing amnesty next year is probably the last hope for the GOP to save itself from losing a core group of its voters\" Dane said.Despite their public support of immigration revisions Republican House leaders accomplished little in 2013.The Senate passed its comprehensive rewrite of the nation\\'s immigration laws in June including $46 billion in border security and an overhaul of the legal immigration system to bring in more high-tech and low-skilled workers.House committees have approved five bills that focus on immigration enforcement and expanding the legal immigration system to bring in more foreign workers. But the last of those bills was approved in June; none of them have been brought to the House floor. No Republicans have introduced a bill that deals with the undocumented population.Some House Republicans are pushing their colleagues to get those bills moving.Reps. David Valadao R-Calif. and Jeff Denham R-Calif. have been pressing Republicans to sign onto a letter they hope to present to Boehner in January supporting action on immigration legislation.Denham would not specify how many signatures they\\'ve garnered so far but he said there is a surprising level of interest among his GOP colleagues.\"We\\'ve been getting a good percentage of our conference signing on\" he said.Denham said they\\'d have even more signatories but some supportive Republicans are reluctant out of fear of primary season. Conservative groups have made clear that they will support more conservative GOP candidates against lawmakers who back the Senate bill so adding their name to the letter could lead to easy attack ads.\"It puts a target on their back\" Denham said.Some also see Boehner\\'s repudiation of outside conservative groups as his chamber passed the budget deal last week as evidence that he might be willing to push an immigration bill that isn\\'t supported by the Tea Party wing of his party.\"It shows that Boehner wants to get things done and he\\'s not going to be held hostage by the extreme right\" said Ali Noorani executive director of the National Immigration Forum a group that supports the Senate bill and has spent the past year encouraging rank-and-file Republicans to embrace it. \"You win the conference you win leadership and we\\'re getting closer and closer to winning the conference.\"In the meantime immigration advocates have turned up the pressure on Republicans in the House.Supporters completed a weeks-long fast for immigration changes on Friday with several members of Congress joining for 24-hour water-only fasts. But the tactics of immigration supporters have grown more and more confrontational.Young undocumented immigrants interrupted Boehner while he was having breakfast several weeks ago they\\'ve staked out the home of Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor R-Va. and have held nearly constant protests outside Majority Whip Rep. Kevin McCarthy\\'s office in California.Last week immigration supporters held sit-ins in the congressional offices of two-dozen representatives.Those moves irked some in Congress. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart R-Fla. has been pushing for new immigration laws for years and said protests aimed at so many members of Congress – including himself and other supporters – are \"not exactly contributing to get this done.\"But others like Rep. Luis Gutierrez D-Ill. said he\\'s not surprised by their impatience and expects it to continue when Congress returns to Washington in January.\"They\\'re angry they\\'re disillusioned they\\'re hurt so you shouldn\\'t expect them to come bringing flowers and roses\" Gutierrez said. \"You should expect them to come here angry.\"',\n",
       " 'Near the end of the 2012 election campaign President Obama accused Mitt Romney of “at least Stage 3 Romnesia”-- which the President described as “If you can\\'t seem to remember the policies on your website or the promises you\\'ve been making over the six years you\\'ve been running for president if you can\\'t even remember what you said last week don\\'t worry.”Well Mr. President look in the mirror for the faults in yourself that you attributed to Mr. Romney.

Worrying that ObamaCare will hurt Democrats in the 2014 elections the President keeps amending and delaying it ignoring his constitutional obligation to fully implement and enforce a law he already signed.The more we learn about ObamaCare from sources including the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office the more we learn how it will damage job creation (especially full-time jobs) and business growth cost way more than advertised grant special exemptions (e.g. to Congress) deny us the choices we were promised to keep our health care plans and doctors raise taxes increase our wait time for medical treatments while eroding the quality of care and cause doctors and hospitals to cut back or eliminate services.[pullquote]In a recent Fox News poll of American voters 57 percent said the way ObamaCare is being rolled out is “a joke” 63 percent said the law needs to be changed 71 percent believed ObamaCare will increase their taxes 62 percent believe it will increase the cost of their premiums and 65 percent believe implementing the law will add to the federal deficit. Gallup and Rasmussen Reports polls show similar negativity by American voters concerning ObamaCare’s future impact on their families and the country.But in his August 17 radio address the President continued to blame Republicans regarding ObamaCare rather than accept personal responsibility for the law’s flaws. He said “A lot of Republicans seem to believe that if they can gum up the works and make this law fail they’ll somehow be sticking it to me. But they’d just be sticking it to you.”(Mis)handling of the economy. In a recent Gallup poll of American adults just 35 percent give the President thumbs up on his leadership regarding the economy. On Townhall.com columnist Katie Pavlich writes “While Obama claims America is ‘back’ 50 million people are on food stamps and 23 million people are unemployed. After claiming the country was on the right track economically Obama proceeded to blame Republicans for ‘distractions’ and ‘phony’ scandals coming out of Washington.”Lack of candor on a range of matters. In an ABC/Washington Post poll (in English and Spanish) of American adults “. . . a vast 74-20 percent see the IRS’ behavior (targeting conservatives) as inappropriate with most feeling that way strongly -- and 56 percent see it as a deliberate attempt to harass conservative organizations not a mere administrative error.” The poll also found that “. . . on the attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi Libya last fall suspicions of a coverup rise to a majority 55 percent. And in this case only a third of Americans are persuaded that the Obama administration is disclosing honestly what it knows about what occurred.”Another poll discovery: “Americans by 54-38 percent say they think the government is doing more to threaten the rights of average Americans than to protect those rights. Americans by 69-29 percent in this poll say they’re concerned that in trying to protect classified information the federal government will improperly intrude on the freedom of the press.”When the President claims that criticisms of him and his policies are partisan and bogus his attitude can be summed up by another Urban Dictionary definition: of “fuhgeddaboudit.”1. Forget about it -- the issue is not worth the time energy mental effort or emotional resources.2. Definitively \"no.\"3. The subject is unequivocally excellent; further thought and analysis are unnecessary.Is a president with “Obamanesia” who says “fuhgeddaboudit” serving the best interests of the country? Polls indicate no.',\n",

       " 'No California business for you!The rivalry between Texas and California is no secret and it goes far beyond the fact that they are the two most populous states in the nation. While neither state is monolithic in terms of its political ideology—Texas has deep-blue Austin while some inland parts of California are a startling shade of crimson—the politics of each state has been marked by radically different ideologies. California\\'s main power bases of economic and political power include two of the places conservatives most love to hate: San Francisco and Hollywood. Meanwhile every single statewide elected official is a Democrat and Democrats have dominated the state legislature despite the roadblocks along the way. In recent years the state government has sought to invest in projects like high-speed rail and solar energy often taxing itself for the privilege Texas of course is just the opposite: a conservative ideological paradise funded substantially by the oil industry with low taxes and a belief that government is the problem not the solution.Because of its ideological ramifications the rivalry between Texas and California is more than just competition for bragging rights between the nations two heaviest hitters; rather it is ground zero in an ideological proxy war between the progressive and conservative factions of larger-scale national politics. And in recent years as the Lone Star State was experiencing its so-called \"Texas Miracle\" while California was limping along from budget crisis to budget crisis it was far from uncommon for conservative ideologues to point to the contrast between the two as evidence of the success of conservative economic policy.Unfortunately for them the tide has turned on this view. First the so-called Texas Miracle turned out to be a sham masked by a combination of rapid population growth high oil prices and low wages. Ironically enough it was billions of dollars in stimulus funds that was propping up Texas\\' budget solvency. When that ran out and the economic crisis finally showed its full effects the state faced a crippling budget deficit of $27 billion and was forced to make massive cuts to Medicaid and education to stay afloat.California meanwhile has been on exactly the opposite trajectory. The voters sick of the tax revolt that had been artificially maintained by the Republican minority voted in a series of structural reforms that loosened the minority\\'s stranglehold in Sacramento and followed that up by passing two tax measures to promote green energy and protect our schools from further cuts. Combined with the economic recovery that has been taking place nationwide these changes were enough to put California\\'s budget back in the black for the first time in many years even as Texas suffers from high poverty low wages and a drastically failing education system.Join me below the fold to learn more about why the economic miracle in Texas was really a mirage.',\n",

       " 'In the months leading up to today\\'s vote on California\\'s Proposition 19 to legalize recreational use of marijuana opponents of legalization have issued a barrage of confused and contradictory arguments. Their aim is to somehow debunk the common-sense fact that legal sourcing erodes the black-market profits of organized crime.The most recent argument thrown out in the anti-Prop. 19 campaign claims that the California marijuana market is insignificant to Mexican drug traffickers.That argument was blown out of the water on October 18 when the Mexican Army and police seized 134 tons of marijuana wrapped and ready to be smuggled from Tijuana across the border. The huge cache was estimated to be worth at least $338 million dollars on the street. Mexican authorities guessed that it was owned by the nation\\'s most powerful drug-trafficking organization the Sinaloa Cartel.Even if much of that is distributed to other states the sheer size of the potential shipment shows that the U.S. marijuana market for Mexican traffickers calculated at $20 billion a year is well worth fighting for. Since before Prop. 19 came along reports showed that Mexico\\'s drug cartels were concerned about how U.S. production and legalization of medical marijuana cut into their profits.Prohibition creates the underground market that generates their economic political and military strength. With the drop in income from marijuana sales cartels have less money for buying arms and politicians or recruiting young people into the trade.The drug cartels also consider the marijuana black market worth killing for. Just days after the historic bust thirteen young men were massacred at a drug rehabilitation center. An anonymous voice came over police radio saying the act was \"a taste of Juarez\" and that up to 135 people could be murdered in retaliation for the bust--one per ton.Although calculating Mexican cartel earnings from marijuana sales will always be a guessing game it\\'s indisputable that as long as it\\'s illegal every penny of those earnings goes into the pockets of organized crime. From the peasant who converts his land from corn to pot to feed his family to the truckdriver who takes on a bonus cargo to the Mexican and U.S. border officials who open \"windows\" in international customs controls to the youth gangs who sell in U.S. cities--all are sucked into a highly organized and brutal system of contraband.Legalization in part of the world\\'s leading market would take a huge chunk out of this transnational business.The government of Mexican president Felipe Calderon along with Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos has redoubled efforts in U.S. media and international forums to oppose the California legalization measure. This is not surprising. These two nations are deeply entrenched in a military-model drug war that has channeled a combined total of nearly $9 billion dollars in U.S. government funds to their governments. As in any war powerful political and economic interests are at stake in perpetuating the drug war.It\\'s interesting to see what they say though. Neither President Santos nor Calderon argue that legalization will strengthen drug cartels. Instead both complain that legalization will erode their drug war by heightening the contradiction between violent crackdowns on growers and traffickers in their countries and the lax attitude toward consumption of marijuana in the United States.At a recent meeting of the Tuxtla Dialogue in Cartagena Colombia\\'s President Juan Manuel Santos said \"It\\'s confusing for our people to see that while we lose lives and invest resources in the fight against drug trafficking in consuming countries initiatives like California\\'s referendum are being promoted.\"It\\'s about time that contradiction was exposed. But the way to resolve it is not to increase fumigation operations that destroy peasant livelihoods and the environment and seizures of marijuana shipments that lead to the deaths of innocent civilians while further criminalizing consumption in the U.S. The way to resolve it is to halt ineffective measures to stop marijuana use and focus scarce resources on attacking the financial and violent aspects of transnational organized crime and providing employment and services for vulnerable sectors. Legalization of marijuana in addition to reducing the economic base of the cartels frees up resources to do just that.In a report from the Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy former presidents of Mexico Colombia Brazil called for discussion on legalizing marijuana noting \"Prohibitionist policies based on the eradication of production and on the disruption of drug flows as well as on the criminalization of consumption have not yielded the expected results. We are farther than ever from the announced goal of eradicating drugs.\" They add that corruption and violence have increased throughout the region as result of the strategy.The war on drugs launched by President Felipe Calderon has led to more than 30000 drug-related deaths since late 2006 and the skyrocketing of human rights violations committed by security forces. Last week an international Forum against militarization and violence in Ciudad Juarez the epicenter of the drug war was disrupted when police shot a peace protester.As Calderon insists that there is \"no alternative\" to the militarized drug war a recent survey shows that three-fourths of Mexicans polled believe the drug war is failing. Particularly in border towns grassroots organizations have formed to protest the violence and high social costs. Meanwhile the government has largely bypassed non-violent ways to reduce the power of cartels such as legalization anti-money laundering efforts and social programs to strengthen affected communities in favor of the military/police model supported by the U.S. government.Organized crime is a business. Reducing demand through providing legal sources hurts that business. Hardline rhetoric and wars of statistics cannot change that fundamental equation.',\n",
       " 'The U.S. War on Marijuana is not just costly time-consuming and unnecessary -- it\\'s also racially biased according to a new report.In recent years several states have passed laws that decriminalized marijuana and a majority of Americans now support legalizing the drug. Yet between 2001 and 2010 there were over 8 million pot arrests in the U.S. What\\'s worse the authorities making the arrests were targeting black Americans far more than whites.According to a new study from the American Civil Liberties Union which tracked marijuana arrests by race and county in all 50 states and the District of Columbia black and white Americans use marijuana at about the same rate. However blacks were nearly four times as likely than whites to be arrested on charges of marijuana possession in 2010.In Washington D.C. Iowa Minnesota and Illinois blacks were 7.5 to 8.5 times more likely than whites to be arrested for possessing pot.Most of the people being arrested weren\\'t drug kingpins. Fifty-two percent of all drug arrests in 2010 were for marijuana and according to the ACLU\\'s analysis most of the arrestees were in possession of small amounts of the drug.Having a black president hasn\\'t eased this racial disparity either. During President Barack Obama’s first three years in office the arrest rate for marijuana possession was about 5 percent higher than the average rate under President George W. Bush The New York Times reported.Obama\\'s first term in office was also marked by an economic recession a soaring deficit (due to the cost of the Bush tax cuts and two wars) and numerous budget battles that threatened to cause state and federal government shutdowns. In the midst of this the costs of the War on Marijuana continued to rise.In 2010 states spent an estimated $3.6 billion enforcing marijuana possession laws which was a 30 percent increase from a decade earlier. Such a large amount of funding provides a strong financial incentive for police to make arrests and boost their crime-fighting statistics the ACLU reported. In fact that same year more people were arrested for marijuana possession than for all violent crimes combined.\"In the past 75 years we have seen mounting evidence of the benign nature of the marijuana plant and its tremendous potential for medical development\" Amanda Reiman policy manager for the Drug Policy Alliance said in 2012. \"But the rampant misinformation about the effects of marijuana USE is dwarfed by the lifetime of suffering that a marijuana CONVICTION can bring.\"Click here to download the full report.',\n",

But for those who have been fighting the legalization of marijuana the announcement increased their concern.Advertisement“The green rush is upon us. The federal government is saying ‘We’re just going to back off’” said a disappointed Derek Franklin president of the Washington Assn. of Substance Abuse and Violence Prevention which had campaigned against the state law.On the other side Alex Cooley co-founder of Solstice said to be the first legal cannabis-growing facility in Washington state called the action a “very large step forward” but that he expected the controversy to continue. “It is not the end of the war on the prohibition of cannabis.”AdvertisementBut conflict between the Colorado and Washington state laws and federal law — which still considers marijuana a Schedule I drug along with cocaine and heroin — had been a source of tension and confusion.Many marijuana advocates said the discord prompted some municipalities to take a wait-and-see approach to enacting zoning and other regulations to permit pot sales not knowing what the federal ramifications would be.Advertisement“I do think it will bring some level of relief or comfort” said Rachel Gillette the Colorado executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. “You can operate without fear the [Drug Enforcement Administration] is going to come seize your property and send you to prison.”But the policy also represents something larger. “It’s a loud statement from the Obama administration that their intent is to let the experiment happen” said John Davis executive director of the Washington state-based Coalition for Cannabis Standards and Ethics.Advertisement“It’s huge” he said. “The fact it mentions adult recreational use is historic.”Franklin whose organization opposes the Washington state law said Thursday’s announcement “really opens the door for other states even wider.” He said not enough has been done to regulate the risk of marijuana abuse. He cautioned against empowering the marijuana industry which he compared to the tobacco and alcohol industries.AdvertisementBut Gillette said this could represent a shift from handling marijuana in punitive ways toward education and rehabilitation.“We’re finally reaching a point where we can look at alternatives to prohibition” she said. “It’s become very very clear that the war on drugs has failed and we need to look at alternative ways to deal with illicit drugs.

       " 'By Mark Felsenthal WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama in an interview broadcast on Sunday blamed conservative Republicans for a stalemate on the budget and insisted that while he is willing to haggle over taxes and government spending he will not make a deal would that would impose conditions on increasing the nation\\'s debt limit. With a possible government shutdown looming in two weeks and the threat of a U.S. debt default as early as mid-October Obama said on ABC\\'s \"This Week with George Stephanopoulos\" that it is up to lawmakers to work out a budget. He insisted the budget should contain enough spending to help support economic growth and said he will not allow Republicans to attach conditions to raising the $16.7 trillion U.S. borrowing cap. \"We\\'ve presented our budget\" Obama said. \"Now it\\'s the job of Congress to come up with a budget that keeps our long-term trends of ... reducing the deficit moving forward but also allows us to invest in the things we need to grow.\" Obama said trading cuts to his signature healthcare program in exchange for an increase in the nation\\'s borrowing limit is not an option. \"What I haven\\'t been willing to negotiate and will not negotiate is on the debt ceiling\" he said. With the crisis over Syria off the boil Washington faces yet another fiscal showdown. Most government operations will cease on October 1 unless Congress passes a budget the president will accept and the United States risks a debt default as early as mid-October if lawmakers delay raising the borrowing cap. Obama and the Republican-led House of Representatives remain at loggerheads over both the budget and the debt limit. Republican lawmakers have sought to make defunding the president\\'s signature healthcare law the Affordable Care Act also known as Obamacare a condition for raising the cap. Obama\\'s administration has delayed implementing such steps as signing final agreements with insurance plans to be sold on federal health insurance exchanges as it struggled to get the law\\'s provisions in place before enrollment opens on October 1. \"This administration has already delayed or waived fully a third of this legislation and we believe it is only fair for the American people now to have that same delay and that\\'s the proposal I believe will be coming forward this week\" Republican Representative Tom Price of Georgia said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" Democratic Representative Chris Van Hollen said on the same program that legislation mandating delays in putting the law in place would stand in the way of making health insurance affordable to many Americans and is \"not acceptable.\" \"WAYS OF DOING THIS\" Lawmakers last week considered extending government funding at current $988 billion levels until mid-December but Tea Party Republicans insisted that cuts to Obamacare remain part of the package. Obama will mark the five-year anniversary of the U.S. financial crisis on Monday in an effort to move back to his domestic agenda after weeks of dealing with Syria and how to respond to its use of chemical weapons. The financial crisis was accelerated on September 15 2008 when the Lehman Brothers firm filed for bankruptcy protection. Obama is expected to focus on the positive discussing progress made and highlighting his prescriptions for boosting job creation amid budget battles with Republicans. He said he would be willing to talk to House Speaker John Boehner about reversing deep across-the-board spending cuts that went into effect this year through the process known as sequestration but said Boehner has been an unwilling partner. \"There are ways of doing this. It\\'s just that they haven\\'t been willing to negotiate in a serious way on that\" Obama said. Obama and Boehner have clashed on repeated occasions over the budget. A standoff over raising the debt limit in 2011 resulted in the first-ever U.S. credit rating downgrade and dealt a setback to the nascent economic recovery. Obama also said he is willing to talk to Republicans about how to accelerate further reductions in the budget deficit. But he pointed out that the deficit has shrunk more quickly than expected and said that efforts by \"a portion of Congress\" to push for sharper budget reductions would only worsen the wide gap between rich and poor in the United States. \"There\\'s no serious economist out there that would suggest that if you took the Republican agenda of slashing education further slashing Medicare further slashing research and development further slashing investments in infrastructure further that would reverse some of these trends of inequality\" he said. The Congressional Budget Office has said it expects the government\\'s annual deficit to shrink to $642 billion in the fiscal year that ends this month the first annual deficit below $1 trillion in five years.

Members\\' office budgets committee staff and leadership offices will all see the same across-the-board cuts as any other discretionary  non-defense spending.Other legislative branch functions — the Capitol Visitor Center the Library of Congress\\'s Books for the Blind program even the Capitol Police — would take cuts of about 9% according to a report from the Office of Management and Budget.In the House each representative gets an annual office budget of about $1.5 million — more for members from expensive and faraway districts.Some congressional offices may feel the cuts more deeply than others. A USA TODAY analysis of 2011 congressional spending showed that 40% of House members had spent more than 90% of their office budgets — and Congress has cut its own budgets by about 8% since then. Additional cuts imposed by the sequester could force these offices to lay off staff or implement other cost-cutting strategies.In 2011 Congress passed — and President Obama signed into law — the Budget Control Act which required the across-the-board cuts of $1.2 trillion as a way to motivate lawmakers to find some other way of reducing the nation\\'s budget deficit. They didn\\'t.Much of the $85 billion cost savings this year will come through furloughs the administration has said. As many as 800000 civilian employees in the Defense Department will have to take 22 days of unpaid leave before Oct. 1. Active-duty military and civilian defense employees in combat zones are exempt as are senior political appointees in the Obama administration who don\\'t fall under federal civil service rules.The Executive Office of the President is subject to the sequester but White House spokesman Jay Carney — while warning of the dire effects of agency cuts — declined to elaborate on how the presidency would be impacted. Again the president\\'s salary wouldn\\'t be cut.When Congress passed the sequester Washington Rep. Norman Dicks then the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee warned colleagues that the sequester would mean the elimination of about two legislative aides in a typical congressional office.Rep.

He said the sequester hasn\\'t come as a surprise — so he doesn\\'t expect that draconian measures will be necessary to come within budget.\"We have been taking this into account with our hiring both on the committee and in my congressional office. So I hope to be able to avoid that\" he said. \"Any federal agency that has been listening to what\\'s been going on for the last year and a half since this issue came up I would hope has also taken that into account in their hiring practices so that they can mitigate the effect. I don\\'t have the faith that all of them have done that.\"Contributing: Alan Gomez',\n",
       " 'Democrats and Republicans remain at odds on how to avoid a round of budget cuts so deep and arbitrary that to allow them now could push the economy back into recession. The cuts known as a sequester will kick in March 1 unless Republicans agree to President Obama’s demand to a legislative package that combines spending reductions and tax increases. As of Thursday with the deadline a week off Republicans seemed determined to say no to any new tax increases.“Spending is the problem” declared the House speaker John Boehner. “Spending must be the focus.” Reflecting the views of many of her Republican colleagues Representative Martha Roby said Wednesday that Mr. Obama “already got his tax increase” as part of the January agreement over the “fiscal cliff” and that no further increases were necessary.Both are wrong. To reduce the deficit in a weak economy new taxes on high-income Americans are a matter of necessity and fairness; they are also a necessary precondition to what in time will have to be tax increases on the middle class. Contrary to Mr. Boehner’s “spending problem” claim much of the deficit in the next 10 years can be chalked up to chronic revenue shortfalls from the Bush-era tax cuts which were only partly undone in the fiscal-cliff deal earlier this year. (Wars and a recession also contributed.) It stands to reason that a deficit caused partly by inadequate revenue must be corrected in part by new taxes. And the only way to raise taxes now without harming the recovery is to impose them on high-income filers for whom a tax increase is unlikely to cut into spending.As it happens those taxpayers are the same ones who benefited most from Bush-era tax breaks and who continue to pay low taxes. Even with recent increases the new top rate of 39.6 percent is historically low; investment income is still taxed at special low rates; and the heirs of multimillion-dollar estates face lower taxes than at almost any time in modern memory.',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON — Two weeks before deep budget cuts are due to slice across the federal government Senate Democrats proposed an alternative Thursday that would swap some reductions for a tax on people who make more than $1 million a year.The proposal has little chance of Republican support even though neither party wants the automatic cuts. But Republicans are increasingly willing to stomach the reductions in defense and domestic spending rather than accept President Obama’s call for a “balanced” approach that matches cuts with new revenue.AdvertisementThe Democratic alternative would replace half of the scheduled cuts with the so-called Buffett Rule a requirement that those who have adjusted gross incomes above $1 million pay a minimum 30% tax rate.The rule a favorite of the president is named for billionaire investor Warren Buffett who has complained that tax loopholes and deductions allow him to pay a lower effective tax rate than his secretary.Advertisement“Now Republicans in Congress face a simple choice” White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said in a statement. “Do they protect investments in education healthcare and national defense or do they continue to prioritize and protect tax loopholes that benefit the very few at the expense of middle- and working-class Americans?”The White House and its Democratic allies in the Senate are returning to a strategy that has shown some success — portraying Republicans as protecting tax breaks for the wealthy at the expense of deep reductions in popular domestic programs.AdvertisementPolls show that although Americans agree with Republicans that deficits are worrisome and that spending should be reduced enthusiasm wanes when the cuts slice into mainstay programs in transportation education or other government services.At the same time majorities of Americans have shown a willingness to ask the wealthiest to pay more as happened when Obama secured a tax increase on households earning more than $450000 in the New Year’s deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff.AdvertisementRepublicans are gambling that by resisting the president’s call for new taxes they will win the budget reductions that they were unable to achieve in the deal.House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) asserted that the cuts called sequestration will begin March 1 unless serious changes are made in federal spending to achieve the Republican goal of bringing the budget into balance within 10 years. Nonpartisan analysts noting that would extract federal money from the still-struggling economy say that could damage the recovery.Advertisement“The sequester will be in effect until there are cuts and reforms that put us on the path to balance the budget over the next 10 years” Boehner said Thursday.The $120-billion proposal from Democrats would postpone the across-the-board cuts for 10 months to make time to craft a broader solution. The Democratic package includes $55 billion in new revenue primarily from the tax on the wealthy along with cuts to farm subsidies and a smaller hit to defense than the automatic cuts coming next month.AdvertisementDemocrats dropped a proposal to close tax breaks on oil companies after protests from four oil-state Democratic senators.The across-the-board cuts would eliminate as many as 750000 jobs and reduce the growth of the nation’s gross domestic product according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.AdvertisementBoehner met privately Thursday with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) but the speaker has resisted the closed-door negotiations that characterized past fiscal battles because they drew protests from lawmakers in his Republican majority.Instead Boehner has shifted the burden of devising legislation to replace sequestration onto the Senate as he has struggled to rally support for proposals from his divided GOP majority in the House.AdvertisementSenate Republicans plan to present their own alternative. Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) would replace the across-the-board cuts with a plan to reduce the federal workforce by hiring only one new employee for every three vacancies.The Democratic and Republican alternatives probably will come to a vote when Congress returns from its weeklong Presidents Day recess.AdvertisementBoth parties’ proposals are likely to fail leaving Congress without a clear alternative days before the cuts begin.lisa.mascaro@latimes.com',\n",

It is simple: She is the only Democrat big enough to separate from President Obama in 2016 and still win a general election. You can't name anybody else who can do that.Why would any Democrat want to do that? It is simple: Because even 3 years from now we are still going to have a shitty economy. President Obama's legacy on the economy is pretty much set: slow middling growth coupled with vast inequality and poverty. Eight more years of treading water is hard sell. You'd have to be an idiot to run on the Obama economic record. For any other Democrat there will be no avoiding it.The cyclic nature of politics should mean the tide is against us. Add to that a Democratic Party that is still afraid of its own shadow and we shouldn't expect any bold policy initiatives that will fix our crap economy. The only thing saving us in a national election is three things:1. Demographics.2. The Republican Party is fucking crazy.3. Hillary.And that's the truth Ruth.\",\n",

       " \"Sen. Warren introducing her student loan bill.Sen. Elizabeth Warren introduced her first bill a simple proposal to give students the same loan rates as the nation's biggest banks. Her proposal would allow the cut-rate loans for students for one year to give Congress the time to come to agreement on a long-term solution to interest rates. Federal Stafford subsidized loan rates for new students are set to double on July 1 to 6.8 percent.Here's a snippet from her floor speech introducing the bill.“Some people say that we can’t afford to help our kids through school by keeping student loan interest rates low” said Senator Warren. “But right now as I speak the federal government offers far lower interest rates on loans every single day–they just don’t do it for everyone. Right now a big bank can get a loan through the Federal Reserve discount window at a rate of about 0.75%. But this summer a student who is trying to get a loan to go to college will pay almost 7%. In other words the federal government is going to charge students interest rates that are nine times higher than the rates for the biggest banks–the same banks that destroyed millions of jobs and nearly broke this economy. That isn’t right. And that is why I’m introducing legislation today to give students the same deal that we give to the big banks.” “Big banks get a great deal when they borrow money from the Fed” Senator Warren continued. “In effect the American taxpayer is investing in those banks. We should make the same kind of investment in our young people who are trying to get an education. Lend them the money and make them to pay it back but give our kids a break on the interest they pay. Let’s Bank on Students… Unlike the big banks students don’t have armies of lobbyists and lawyers. They have only their voices. And they call on us to do what is right.”Sen. Warren is selling herself a little short there. Students don't just have their voices. They have Elizabeth Warren's voice too. That's a damned good thing.Add your voice.

       " 'The lunch speaker for Saturday’s session of the California Republican Party convention had to talk by video as he was trapped in Washington due to the days-long government shutdown.Metaphor? Yes.Rep. Greg Walden’s absence from the Anaheim gathering exemplified the shadow the Capitol standoff has cast across grass-roots Republicans eying next year’s elections. In Anaheim as in Washington the mood among Republicans seemed to meld support for the goals of GOP congressional leaders and an expectation that Republicans would pay a price for them.Everyone at the event from congressional Republicans on down was trying to push blame for the shutdown onto Democrats in defiance of national polls showing more Americans blame Republicans than President Obama or his party.Advertisement“I sure wish I could be with you in person but as you’ve seen a few things are going on in Washington as we fight to stand up for our Republican principles” Walden who represents a district in Oregon said on the video played to a few hundred delegates.“Getting anything done has been incredibly difficult as we have a president and a Democratically-controlled Senate who refuse even to even negotiate and work with Republicans to fund the government and make changes to Obamacare. Even on important nonpartisan issues like cancer funding and keeping the World War II memorial open to World War II veterans the Democrats refuse to budge.”He echoed what Sharon Day co-chair of the Republican National Committee had said a day earlier when she was asked if the federal government shutdown would harm Republican chances next year. She angrily denounced President Obama and Harry Reid the Democratic leader of the Senate for their tactics and what she described as efforts to bait Republicans.“If you look at it they have truly become the ‘party of no’ in this battle” she said using a sobriquet frequently flung at Republicans. “I’d like to see the president and I’d like to see Harry Reid stop throwing around statements and comments that are not helpful and I’d like them to sit down and compromise. …Advertisement“If you remember it was the senators who didn’t show up to work on the bill while the Republican Congress worked till midnight. It was the president that played golf while the Republican Congress individuals continued to work and try to find solutions.”Inevitably however she turned to the impact.“Does it have an impact? I guess it will have an impact” she said her body language implying the fallout would be negative: “But the right thing is what I believe -- what the Congress is doing is trying to find solutions unlike the president and Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi who just simply say ‘I want it all I want it now and I don’t care what your compromises are I’m not even going to show up to work and do my job.’”Jim Brulte the state Republican Party chairman declined to say whether he thought Republicans would pay for the shutdown. But an analogy he drew — the fact that President George H. W. Bush was intensely popular in 1991 and lost his reelection race in 1992 — suggested he thought the fallout for Republicans might be short-lived.Advertisement“For anyone to suggest that they know what’s going to happen in November of 2014 based on what’s happening in October of 2013 is either a prophet or a fool” he said. “And I may be one but I try not to be either of them.”cathleen.decker@latimes.comTwitter: @cathleendecker',\n",
       " 'This morning CNN had only released some of the results of their poll. Now they\\'ve released the second part and boy it\\'s a doozy for the GOP.In a sign of the political hangover congressional Republicans are suffering in the wake of the government shutdown three-quarters of Americans in a new national poll say that most GOP members of Congress don\\'t deserve to be re-elected. A CNN/ORC International survey released Monday also found a majority saying that the Republicans\\' policies are too extreme. And according to the poll Democrats have an 8-point advantage over the Republicans in an early indicator in the battle for control of Congress. But with more than a year to go until the 2014 midterm elections there\\'s plenty of time for these numbers to change. .... More than seven in 10 questioned in the survey said that most members of Congress don\\'t deserve to be re-elected with nearly four in 10 saying even their own representative doesn\\'t deserve a return ticket to Washington next year. Both figures are hovering around all-time highs in CNN polling. \"Although incumbent members of Congress of both parties are not very popular the shutdown seems to have only affected views of GOP incumbents\" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. Three-fourths of people questioned in the survey said that most congressional Republicans don\\'t deserved to be re-elected 21 percentage points higher than the 54% who say most Democrats don\\'t deserve another term in office. Only one in five say most Republicans deserve to be re-elected; 42% say the same thing about Democrats on Capitol Hill.Deserve re-election?Yes NoDem 40% 56%GOP 20% 76%Now this question was asked of all Americans and NOT of registered voters (and obviously not of likely voters). The CNN pollask it of registered voters as well and from the smaller sample registered voters were slightly more angry at both parties. Here I\\'ve put it in chart form.Of note that 40% for Democrats among registered voters is actually not the worst we\\'ve seen in recent history. The August 2010 numbers had only 36% of registered voters saying Democrats deserved re-election to Congress. However that 20% for the GOP is thein the poll\\'s history by far surpassing the previous low of just 31% taken back in August 2011 during the last debt ceiling fight.This is now spilling over into the generic ballot question as well.Fifty percent of registered voters questioned said they would vote for the Democrat in their district with 42% backing the Republican. The 8-point Democratic margin in the CNN poll is the same as in a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey and close to the 9-point advantage for the Democrats in the generic ballot in a recent Quinnipiac University poll. \"We\\'re a long way away from saying that the Democrats have a chance to regain control of the House\" Holland cautioned. \"There is more than a year to go before any votes are actually cast and the \\'generic ballot\\' question is not necessarily a good predictor of the actual outcome of 435 separate elections. A year before the 2010 midterms for example the Democrats held a 6-point lead on the generic ballot.\" The Republicans eventually won back control of the House in 2010 thanks to a historic 63-seat pickup.So again while the signs look good now they looked good for Democrats as well in 2010 and we all know the misery that followed. The generic ballot question almost always overestimates how well Democrats will do an entire year out from the actual election. Notice in 2006 a good year for Democrats it only overestimated by a tiny bit. But in the midterm years good for the GOP like 2002 and 2010 anyone thinking we were going to do OK because of the generic ballot question was in for a rude awakening. So recent history tells us that even if 2014 turns out to be a good year for Democrats the generic ballot question STILL overestimates how well we\\'re going to do a year ahead but only by a little.Notice in the 2010 average of the polls on October 21 2009 (exactly 4 years ago) Democrats held a 45%-39.5% advantage on the generic ballot question. And then a year later a massive 63-seat loss in the House with Republicans actually getting 51.6% of the vote and Democrats only getting 44.8% of the vote.So while this poll is good news don\\'t you dare take anything for granted just yet.',\n",
       " 'Much of the media commentary on President Obama’s big inequality speech was cynical. You know the drill: it’s yet another “reboot” that will go nowhere; none of it will have any effect on policy and so on. But before we talk about the speech’s possible political impact or lack thereof shouldn’t we look at the substance? Was what the president said true? Was it new? If the answer to these questions is yes — and it is — then what he said deserves a serious hearing.And once you realize that you also realize that the speech may matter a lot more than the cynics imagine.First about those truths: Mr. Obama laid out a disturbing — and unfortunately all too accurate — vision of an America losing touch with its own ideals an erstwhile land of opportunity becoming a class-ridden society. Not only do we have an ever-growing gap between a wealthy minority and the rest of the nation; we also he declared have declining mobility as it becomes harder and harder for the poor and even the middle class to move up the economic ladder. And he linked rising inequality with falling mobility asserting that Horatio Alger stories are becoming rare precisely because the rich and the rest are now so far apart.This isn’t entirely new terrain for Mr. Obama. What struck me about this speech however was what he had to say about the sources of rising inequality. Much of our political and pundit class remains devoted to the notion that rising inequality to the extent that it’s an issue at all is all about workers lacking the right skills and education. But the president now seems to accept progressive arguments that education is at best one of a number of concerns that America’s growing class inequality largely reflects political choices like the failure to raise the minimum wage along with inflation and productivity.',\n",
       " 'Even if all the hidden money funneled into campaigns through private 501(c) organizations had come from businesses — unlikely given the contributions by noncorporate groups like Planned Parenthood and the N.R.A. — corporate spending would not reach $400 million still a small share of the total.Perhaps this should not be surprising. For companies spending on elections can be risky. Business executives might prefer lobbying where they spend far more than on campaign contributions not because the limits are more relaxed but because swaying legislators on both sides of the aisle is more effective at getting what they want. And such lobbying is less likely to kindle anger among consumers shareholders and other constituents than spending to change the outcome of elections.“While Citizens alters the ability of corporations to contribute to campaigns it does not alter their substantial risk in doing so” the political scientists Wendy L. Hansen Michael Rocca and Brittany Ortiz of the University of New Mexico Albuquerque argued in a recent study.Still corporations’ reluctance to open their checkbooks suggests an intriguing alternative explanation for the rise of Republicans who are willing to defy their will: companies may have spent too little. Their money was swamped by that of big individual donors who are more ideologically extreme. In 2012 the top 0.1 percent of donors contributed more than 44 percent of all campaign contributions. In 1980 their share of contributions was less than 10 percent.Corporations have a pro-Republican bias of course. But it is not quite as extreme as pop culture would have it and is certainly less pronounced than organized labor’s pro-Democrat leanings.Effective lobbying requires both Republican and Democratic friends. Political action committees run by businesses are known for spreading money on both sides of the partisan divide. They give to incumbents. They choose winners. They show little partisan loyalty.In the 2006 elections when the G.O.P. controlled Congress corporate PACs gave 65 percent of their money to Republicans. In 2008 and 2010 after the Democrats had swept both the House and Senate they split their contributions roughly fifty-fifty.',\n",

Schultz had been trying for months to rouse the country into thinking hard about why our political system has run aground. “We can’t do this too many more times” he said referring to crises like the fiscal cliff. “We are sapping the country’s spirit. Our political system is broken.” He blamed among other things the practice of gerrymandering and the big money flowing into campaigns.He’s right. The incentives to put country over party have vanished. Elected officials who cross party leaders get stripped of their committee assignments — as happened to four Republican legislators this week who were not viewed as “team players.” The combination of gerrymandered districts and a primary system that empowers a small coterie of party hard-liners has meant that representatives and senators who don’t toe the party line get booted out of office. Mickey Edwards the former congressman from Oklahoma has written a book “The Parties Versus The People” in which he proposes that we move to an open primary system where all candidates of every persuasion run — with the top two finishers facing off in the general election. That would help loosen the grip party extremists now have on their representatives.Thursday night after I got home I had a phone conversation with Scott Rigell a Virginia Republican who first won election in 2010 by campaigning as a modern-day fiscal conservative. That is to say he believed as he told me “that we have a spending problem not a revenue problem.”But after he got to Congress he dug deeper and came to what he calls “a data-driven analytic conclusion.” Namely: spending cuts alone could not eliminate the deficit. The country needed more tax revenue as well. He showed his data to everyone he could on his side of the aisle. They nodded politely and continued to insist on not raising taxes. Rigell did not revert back however. “We have to have the courage to critique and refine our own platform” he said. “That isn’t weakness. It is intellectual honesty.”I asked him if he had been punished by leadership for his courageous views. “No” he said.Give them time I thought.',\n",

The poll funded by the liberal advocacy group Americans United for Change showed that voters across party lines were overwhelmingly in favor of extending the benefits with 63 to 68 percent of voters in each district expressing support for preserving jobless benefits.Voters in the four districts surveyed said they were less likely to vote for the Republican incumbent in 2014 -- by at least a 9-point margin -- were he to vote to cut off extended unemployment benefits.Though jobless benefits are set to expire on Dec. 28 for 1.3 million longterm unemployed Americans members of the House and Senate have returned home for the holidays without a solution to preserve those benefits.

But a wrinkle in state law meant he couldn’t spend it in the final two months of the campaign without jeopardizing the anonymity he had promised his rich donors.So Russo turned to what he called “the Koch network.” He asked a political consultant who has worked with billionaire Republican contributors Charles and David Koch to shuttle the money through an Arizona nonprofit. That group which is not required to reveal its donors could send cash to California causes without names attached.But things went from bad to worse. Although Russo handed over $25 million only about $15 million ended up back in California. And when the money surfaced it sparked an investigation by state authorities who last month levied $16 million in penalties against the Arizona group and three others.AdvertisementThe case offers a rare glimpse into the shadowy world of politically active nonprofits which have played an increasing role in elections nationwide since the U.S. Supreme Court eased campaign rules in 2010. They provide donors a way to influence elections by piping major money around the country until it resurfaces — without their fingerprints — in a campaign.Advocates of transparency in government call it “dark money.”Russo declined to be interviewed by The Times. But he and his colleagues detailed their experience for California investigators conversations that were recorded in hundreds of pages of transcripts.Those records and other documents released by authorities show a convoluted money trail. They also show the risks of operating in a political world so intricate that even Russo didn’t fully understand how it worked when he threw in his donors’ money.Advertisement“There’s all kinds of groups all over the country that I wouldn’t even know” Russo said.::California Republicans faced two major battles last year: a fight against Gov. Jerry Brown’s tax hike and a push to pass a measure that would limit unions’ political fundraising.Russo did not think the state party was up to the task. He envisioned an independent advertising pitch to voters that would tout economic destruction wrought by tax increases and political havoc caused by powerful California labor unions.AdvertisementTo bring in the big money needed for a statewide television campaign Russo worked with GOP consultant Jeff Miller lead fundraiser for former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and for Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s 2012 presidential campaign. Miller declined to be interviewed by The Times.The Fisher family of the clothing firm Gap Inc. contributed more than $9 million. San Francisco investor Charles Schwab gave $6.4 million and Los Angeles philanthropist Eli Broad sent $1 million.The money went to a Virginia nonprofit that would use it to pay for the ad blitz and be allowed to keep the contributors secret. Nonprofits unlike political action committees are not required to identify their donors under federal law.Many donors did not want to “put their name on … this fight because they didn’t want to face the retribution of the unions” Miller told state investigators. Deep-pocketed labor groups were planning major campaign efforts in 2012 and some conservatives were wary of crossing them.AdvertisementBut by the time the money was pouring in summer was turning into fall. If the donations were spent after early September there was a risk that the veil would have to be lifted on those who wrote the checks in accordance with California’s complex campaign laws.That’s when Russo turned to Republican strategist Sean Noble who has worked as a consultant for the Koch brothers and whom he had met on a trip to Las Vegas the year before.Noble heads the Center to Protect Patient Rights an Arizona nonprofit known as a clearinghouse for conservative causes. In 2010 the organization had distributed more than $55 million to 26 groups allied with Republicans to help them in the midterm elections.Robert Tappan a spokesman for Koch Industries confirmed that Noble has worked for the Koch brothers as a political consultant. Charles and David Koch did not play any role in California campaigns last year Tappan said.AdvertisementNoble declined to speak with investigators according to Gary Winuk enforcement chief at the California Fair Political Practices Commission and he did not answer requests for comment from The Times.Noble had already helped Russo with hundreds of thousands of dollars for political research and focus groups. Now Russo needed a different kind of assistance.He wanted the Virginia group Americans for Job Security to transfer the millions he had raised with Miller to Noble’s center and he wanted Noble to relay the money to California campaign committees obscuring the money trail.There were risks. Russo and Miller would forfeit control of the donations and they knew little about Noble. But donors had recommended him the pair told investigators. And “we were running out of options” Miller said.AdvertisementOn Sept. 10 the Virginia group sent about $4 million to Noble’s Center to Protect Patient Rights. Within a few days the center routed roughly the same sum to an Iowa nonprofit which sent it to a newly created California campaign committee.Russo and Miller then directed $20.5 million more to the center for a total of nearly $25 million.The state documents show that one of the donors working with Russo and Miller whose name was crossed out emailed Charles Koch to ask for his direct assistance.“It would be great if you could support the final effort with several million” the donor wrote adding that “Sean Noble from your group has been immensely helpful” and “I look forward to seeing you on a golf course.”Advertisement::A month before the November election the whole operation came crashing down.At that point Noble had routed about $4 million to a California campaign committee. Russo sent him a text message asking for more cash and $11 million was quickly delivered to the Small Business Action Committee a California PAC fighting higher taxes and supporting the anti-union measure.The money had come from an obscure Phoenix nonprofit Americans for Responsible Leadership which had received it from the Center to Protect Patient Rights.AdvertisementAn $11-million donation attracts immediate attention even in a state as large as California. Americans for Responsible Leadership refused to tell the Fair Political Practices Commission California’s ethics watchdog where the money originated and the agency launched an investigation to determine whether disclosure laws had been violated.That heat created a problem. When Russo next asked Noble to transfer money Noble balked. Expressing concern about the investigation Noble said he didn’t think he could help now Russo told investigators.Miller believed Noble hoped to prevent California authorities “from opening up his books” giving them the keys to an entire network of nonprofits that were distributing money around the country.Russo never pried another dime from Noble. Russo said he and Miller scrambled to raise more cash to make up for the rest of the funds.AdvertisementMiller said he was angry. “But at that point” he said “we were screwed you know because we didn’t have any legal control.”On election day voters passed Brown’s tax-hike plan and rejected the anti-union measure delivering two blows to the Republicans.Late last month state officials announced they were fining the Center to Protect Patient Rights and Americans for Responsible Leadership a total of $1 million for violating California law. The groups should have disclosed that the center was the source of the campaign money but had failed to do so authorities said.The Small Business Action Committee and another California campaign group were ordered to pay the state $15 million equivalent to the amount of money state officials said was improperly reported. The Iowa group that was the conduit for $4 million was not fined because it is more established in California politics Winuk said.AdvertisementRusso sitting in his lawyer’s Sacramento office in July told authorities he still wasn’t sure what happened to the $10 million that never came back to California.chris.megerian@latimes.comanthony.york@latimes.com',\n",
       " 'President Obama has nominated one of the nation’s best lawyers Mary Jo White to be the next chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.Ms. White has a formidable record as a prosecutor from 1993 to 2002 when she was the United States attorney in the Southern District of New York. She also has a stellar reputation as a white-collar defense attorney at Debevoise & Plimpton where she has been chief of litigation since 2002 representing several of the firms and executives that she would regulate at the S.E.C.Her résumé in the past decade has understandably alarmed advocates of financial reform who fear that her work as a defender of Wall Street means that she is dangerously biased in favor of the banks and their deregulatory agenda. Her lack of a deep regulatory background is also a worry at a time when the agency’s top priority is to finish overdue rules to carry out the Dodd-Frank financial reform and other securities laws. Complicating matters further her husband John White is also a corporate lawyer at Cravath Swaine & Moore with his own long list of Wall Street clients.We understand these concerns but do not believe they are disqualifying. Ms. White is a worthy nominee though clearly the White House and Ms. White will have to address the conflicts of interest in her background frankly and persuasively. Equally important she must be able to demonstrate in her confirmation hearing that she is not captive to the financial industry’s view of the world which has dominated her recent professional life.',\n",
       " 'Conservative behavior since President Obama’s reelection in November has evoked at least in me a keen sense of sadness. Hardly a day goes by without weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth by the likes of Rush Limbaugh on talk radio and Sean Hannity on Fox News over Obama’s return to the White House. Similar whining is heard among Republicans on Capitol Hill.Simply put conservatives are in agony over the president’s smashing victory. Their pain is hard to watch. Only small-minded Democrats would gloat.What we’re seeing is the impact of losing when you believed with all your heart soul and mind buttressed by the predictions of pollsters and pundits that you would win handily.The reaction is for me heart-rending.Consider the feeble attempt by House Republicans to recover political ground by threatening Obama over the debt limit.The poor things crazed by their defeat didn’t realize that they had no leverage. They had to back down with a face-saving gimmick to suspend through May enforcement of the limit on federal borrowing.Consider some Republicans’ return to the issue of what happened in Benghazi Libya. Did they really think that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would traipse up to the Hill this week prostrate herself before Congress and confess to something that she knew wasn’t true?They so wanted her to say that there was mendacity and attempts by the administration to cover up malfeasance in the Sept. 11 attack on a U.S. diplomatic facility. Some seemed truly distressed that Clinton wouldn’t give them what they wanted. They were so desperate. It was so sad.And so it has gone since election night. The lamentations abound:●Obama’s nominations of Jack Lew as Treasury secretary and Chuck Hagel as defense secretary are confrontational; woe unto us.●“I would have liked to have seen some outreach” in Obama’s inaugural address complained Sen. John McCain who with his Republican cohorts did everything they could to kick Barack Obama out of the White House.●The Obama administration will “attempt to annihilate the Republican Party . . . to just shove us into the dustbin of history” House Speaker John Boehner wailed this week.And so it goes: one big conservative pity party.Imagine how hard it must have been to lose.For four long years they hit Obama with everything they had assailing him at every turn. No insult was too offensive to be hurled; no abuse too outrageous to be tried; no name too abusive to call.From Day One destruction of the Obama administration and preventing his reelection was top priority; the second item too far down the list to remember.Four years of blame blame blame. Blah blah blah.Conservatives on Capitol Hill and right-wing commentators left nothing on the field.They gave it their all — and came up empty.What an emotional letdown. How not to feel at least a little sorry for them?So where do they go from here?This should be a time for introspection for conservatives to examine their thoughts and look inside for answers as to why they lost when at first blush they had so much going for them. And why were they so dead set on not just defeating but breaking this president?Hard-liners of course will take exception to my characterization of their behavior. What I might call abusive or mean they would probably describe as passionate: their passionate defense of liberty the Constitution smaller government free enterprise and the individual — all things they see Obama as opposing.The conservative wing regards itself as all that stands between freedom and tyranny between order and chaos between values and licentiousness.And perhaps that self-view explains why they are taking their loss so hard.It also may help explain why their conduct is so well touching.Conservatives yakking it up in House and Senate chambers and on the airwaves these days are delusional in much the way that the South deluded itself into thinking it was in the right during the Civil War or that Republicans held fast to the misguided belief that the presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt was wrong for the country.American principles endure. But America is changing just as it evolved during the Lincoln era and just as it emerged from the Great Depression under FDR’s leadership.What makes this so excruciatingly sad is that some forces on the right are too far gone to see the truth.Read more from Colbert King’s archive.',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON — Legislation to fund the government cleared the Senate on Friday but moved to the House where infighting among the Republican majority left little time for Congress to act before a midnight Monday deadline to avert a shutdown of many government programs.House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) left the Capitol after a midmorning meeting with his leadership team failed to reach consensus on an approach. He plans to assemble Republicans again at noon Saturday.AdvertisementThe Democrats who control the Senate easily beat back a GOP strategy led by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) that aimed to tie the government funding bill to a measure that would have blocked President Obama’s healthcare law. More than half of the Republican senators joined the Democrats in rejecting Cruz’s hard-line approach.But Cruz and his conservative Republican allies in the House have refused to relinquish the fight. The senator met privately with tea party lawmakers in the House this week complicating Boehner’s efforts to unite his restive majority around a strategy.AdvertisementAs the speaker and his leadership team tried to devise an endgame federal agencies began notifying employees about whether they would be furloughed in the event of a shutdown and prepared to shutter the popular Smithsonian museums close national parks and halt many basic government services.Obama in a late-afternoon appearance in the White House briefing room warned Republicans not to “threaten to burn the house down simply because you haven’t gotten 100% of your way.”Advertisement“My message to Congress is this: Do not shut down the government. Do not shut down the economy” he said. “Pass a budget on time. Pay our bills on time. Refocus on the everyday concerns of the American people.”The president cast the GOP effort as “political grandstanding” and said he would not buckle. “The House Republicans are so concerned with appeasing the tea party that they’ve threatened a government shutdown or worse unless I gut or repeal the Affordable Care Act” Obama said. “That’s not going to happen.”AdvertisementTea party Republicans see the threat of a shutdown as their best chance to stop the Affordable Care Act before Tuesday when the online marketplaces to buy health insurance under the new law are set to open. But the president said Friday that the marketplaces would open on time even if there is a shutdown. “That’s a done deal” he said.Many Republican strategists have warned that voters will blame their party for a shutdown noting that happened the last time government offices were shuttered in 1995 and 1996. But many conservative lawmakers were not in Congress then and have rejected such warnings saying polls show Americans do not support Obamacare.AdvertisementRepublicans meanwhile sought to blame Obama for the standoff.“The House will take action that reflects the fundamental fact that Americans don’t want a government shutdown and they don’t want the train wreck that is Obamacare” said Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck. “Grandstanding from the president who refuses to even be a part of the process won’t bring Congress any closer to a resolution.”AdvertisementThe deep GOP divisions spilled into the open this week as Cruz rankled fellow Republicans with his attention-getting 21-hour-plus Senate speech promoting what many colleagues view as a doomed strategy.Cruz and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) met Thursday with some of the most conservative House Republicans for a dinner that lasted late into the evening. The senators encouraged their colleagues to stand firm against any funding bill that does not fully delay the healthcare law.Advertisement“I am hopeful; I am confident that the House will continue to stand its ground continue to listen to the American people and step up to respond and to stop this train wreck — this nightmare that is Obamacare” Cruz said after the Senate votes that sent the bill back to the House without the provision to cut money for the healthcare program.At the same time the U.S. Chamber of Commerce which is influential among Republicans urged Congress in a letter also signed by 235 other groups not to shut down the government or default on the debt. The debt limit must be raised by Oct. 17 for the nation to continue paying its bills and avoid a default.AdvertisementThe party’s former standard-bearer presidential candidate Mitt Romney also warned against the strategy. “The tactic of using a government shutdown to try and push that will be counterproductive politically” he said in an interview on CNN’s “The Lead with Jake Tapper.” “I don’t think that will be as effective.”House Republicans plan to discuss several proposals Saturday that would tie a new Obamacare rollback provision to the funding bill. That could prolong the standoff with the Senate and lead to a legislative pingpong that could take days to resolve all but ensuring that the government would shut down.AdvertisementThe hard-right flank is pushing for a one-year delay of the healthcare law. The proposal by Rep. Tom Graves (R-Ga.) is supported by more than 60 other House Republicans and if they hold firm they could deny Boehner the majority he needs to pass a less restrictive measure.Other Republicans have suggested delaying the mandate that individuals must carry health insurance by 2014 or face a fine.AdvertisementSome have also suggested more modest measures including one to repeal a tax on medical-device manufacturers and another to prevent members of Congress and staff from receiving federal funding toward their health insurance — a hit to lawmakers’ pocketbooks that members of Congress oppose.Boehner may see no option but to try again to cut back Obamacare but the strategy of tacking other healthcare provisions onto the funding bill appears doomed to fail. Democrats in the Senate are united in their pledge to protect the healthcare law. No Democratic senators voted Friday to end funding for the program.AdvertisementSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) who has taken to calling House Republicans “anarchists” dismissed the tea party flank as the “weird caucus.”“Any bill that continues to play political games will force a government shutdown” he said. “To be absolutely clear: We are going to accept nothing as it relates to Obamacare.”AdvertisementAlternatively Boehner could seek support from Democrats to approve a funding bill without any healthcare provisions but he has been reluctant to do that for fear of upsetting his conservative majority.That Cruz has continued to pursue his strategy despite its failure in the Senate pointed to the sway of tea-party-aligned organizations that have supported the renegade Republican over the elected party leadership.Advertisement“It says more about the Republican leadership than it says about Cruz” said Chris Chocola a former Indiana congressman who is president of the Club for Growth a free-market group influential among Republicans. “They leave this huge void for someone to come up with an idea and provide leadership and they don’t like it when someone does.”lisa.mascaro@latimes.comAdvertisementmichael.memoli@latimes.com',\n",

       " 'Sen. Robert Menendez sponsored legislation with incentives for natural gas vehicle conversions that would benefit the biggest political donor to his re-election the same eye doctor whose private jet Menendez used for two personal trips to the Dominican Republic an Associated Press investigation found.The disclosure reflects the latest intersection between the New Jersey Democrat who is the subject of an ethics inquiry on Capitol Hill and the Florida doctor involved in a federal criminal investigation.Dr. Salomon Melgen invested in Gaseous Fuel Systems Corp. of Weston Fla. and joined its board of directors in early 2010 according to the company\\'s chief executive and a former company consultant. GFS as the company is known designs manufactures and sells products to convert diesel-fuel fleets to natural gas. The amount of Melgen\\'s investment is confidential under rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission but a 2009 document filed with the SEC showed the company required a minimum individual investment at that time of $51500.At the same time Menendez emerged as a principal supporter of a natural gas bill that would boost tax credits and grants to truck and heavy vehicle fleets that converted to alternative fuels. The bill stalled in the Senate Finance Committee and after it was revived in 2012 the NAT GAS Act failed to win the needed 60 votes to pass.While the bill was under consideration between 2009 and 2011 the former consultant for GFS spent $220000 lobbying Menendez\\'s staff and other congressional and federal officials on the act\\'s provisions as well as other regulatory issues according to interviews and Senate records.There is no evidence that Menendez offered direct help or intervened on behalf of the company or Melgen. Instead the connection between the two men\\'s interests in natural gas is the latest example of the close symmetry between the senator — who recently rose to become chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee — and his millionaire backer. It illustrates the way Menendez\\'s political clout has at times overlapped with Melgen\\'s financial investments.In recent weeks Menendez has acknowledged other dealings with Melgen. Menendez was compelled to reimburse $58000 for two flights aboard Melgen\\'s private jet that he had previously failed to report prompting scrutiny by the Senate Ethics Committee. Menendez also acknowledged that his office had contacted U.S. health agencies in 2009 and 2012 to question their billing practices and policies amid a dispute between Melgen an eye specialist and federal health authorities. FBI agents in January searched Melgen\\'s offices in Florida and seized files as part of a criminal investigation.Menendez also raised concerns last year with State and Commerce Department officials about the Dominican Republic\\'s reluctance to enforce a port security contract with a company that Melgen partly owns.A spokeswoman for Menendez Patricia Enright told the AP that the senator supported the natural gas bill to help improve the environment. She said Menendez personally had no known discussions with either Melgen or others associated with GFS concerning the legislation or its impact on the company. She said it was unclear whether the senator will continue to support the bill he had sponsored.Melgen\\'s attorney in Miami Kirk Ogrosky told the AP in a statement that \"Dr. Melgen has never discussed his involvement with Gaseous Fuel Systems Corp. with either Sen. Menendez or his staff.\"An SEC document filed last week by GFS showed that Melgen remains on the company\\'s board of directors. An earlier document filed by the firm in May 2011 was the first to show Melgen as a director. That SEC record showed a $6 million investment in the firm from two unnamed individuals.The company\\'s top executive Ken Green said Melgen is a key investor but has had no influence on the company\\'s decision-making and has not attended any director\\'s meetings since he joined the firm.\"Dr. Melgen hasn\\'t ever been to our offices not once\" Green told the AP. \"He\\'s a passive investor.\"Green said the Senate bill that Menendez supported would provide only limited help to his company because most of its provisions are aimed at heavy on-road vehicles like truck rigs and bus fleets. GFS has pioneered an engine conversion system that can be installed on diesel-fueled vehicles but Green said it is marketed exclusively for off-road equipment such as massive mining trucks. The tax credits proposed by the bill would do little to offset the cost to buyers of the off-road trucks which can cost as much as $8 million Green said.\"This bill won\\'t do much of anything for us\" he said.But in 2010 when Melgen first invested in GFS the firm was actively considering marketing its natural gas engine devices for on-road vehicles. The bill both in its 2009 and 2012 versions authorized changes to IRS rules allowing larger tax credits for on-road natural gas-supplied trucks and vehicles as well as grants for research. The proposal also urged the Environmental Protection Agency to streamline rules covering the conversion of diesel and gas engines to natural gas and alternative fuels.GFS said in October 2010 in a press release that its strategy \"integrates four related areas of business development\" including \"on-road coal truck conversions.\" The release written by the company\\'s consultant and then-director of strategic projects Elio Muller also said that \"a vast number of on-road 18-wheeler tractor-trailer trucks hauling coal\" in the Appalachian region of Kentucky and West Virginia could be converted to combination diesel-natural gas engines with the GFS system.Muller a former Commerce Department official in the Clinton administration involved in several Tampa businesses said last week that he introduced Melgen to Green and other GFS officials in early 2010. Green also said Muller was instrumental in bringing the company to Melgen\\'s attention. Muller said he has known Melgen from Florida\\'s Democratic political circles dating back to the late 1990s. At one point Muller drew up plans to start a business Melgen & Muller Inc. but the men never followed through.Melgen has made investments in health-related companies since the 1990s according to SEC reports but his GFS stake is his only evident natural gas-related investment. Green said he met several times with Melgen and found him to be an \"intelligent investor\" but could not explain his sudden interest in natural gas.\"I don\\'t know how he found out about natural gas but he liked what we were doing and thought it was innovative\" Green said.By early 2010 when Melgen formally joined GFS Menendez had already taken on a key role in backing the natural gas bill joining Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada and Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah as out-front sponsors.The NAT GAS Act quickly drew energy and environmental battle lines. Oil and alternative energy magnate T. Boone Pickens led corporate natural gas industry backers of the bill aided by the Obama administration and influential environmental groups. Arrayed against the bill were top oil and coal firms and even some green activists joined by industrialists David and Charles Koch whose political action group Americans for Prosperity harnessed opposition from conservative groups.Green said he did not authorize or hire any lobbyists on behalf of GFS because he was skeptical about broadening into the markets for on-road trucks. But he did not block the activities of Muller who in addition to his consulting role with GFS had also started his own firm Diesel 2 Gas. It aimed to license GFS technology and use the firm\\'s parts to outfit on-road trucks.In June 2010 representing both GFS and Diesel 2 Gas Muller testified before an EPA panel in Ann Arbor Mich. about what he called \"cumbersome and unnecessary\" rules that hurt GFS and other natural gas firms. The EPA agreed to alter its regulations in April 2011.Between 2009 and 2011 Muller also ran an independent consulting firm Muller Group Inc. which paid $220000 to lobbyists from Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck LLP to lobby for the NAT GAS Act and related issues.Muller said he accompanied the lobbyists in at least one meeting with Menendez\\' staff about the bill but could not recall details. Melgen and Muller joined Menendez at a signing ceremony in Miami in January 2010 for the senator\\'s book \"Growing American Roots.\" And last June they joined Menendez at the annual U.S.-Spain Council Annual Forum in Jersey City.Muller said he did not discuss his lobbying activities with Melgen even though they were both involved with GFS.Both Muller and Melgen also have fundraising ties to Menendez. Muller gave $5000 to Menendez\\' New Jersey Senate re-election campaign in 2011. Melgen has been a staunch supporter giving more than $14000 directly to Menendez since the late 1990s and through his eye clinic donating $700000 last year to a \"super\" political committee that supported Democratic Senate candidates. The committee in turn spent $582000 to back Menendez\\' campaign.',\n",

       " 'RICHMOND Va. — Ken Cuccinelli is running for governor not Congress but the Virginia Republican is struggling to dodge the political fallout from Capitol Hill.His campaign in this crucial battleground state is in danger of becoming the first political casualty of the federal government shutdown which Americans largely blame on Republicans.AdvertisementWith the election just weeks away Cuccinelli’s poll numbers have tumbled since federal agencies were closed Oct. 1. The conservative state attorney general was already lagging but he went from within striking distance of a vulnerable Democrat to trailing by 8 to 10 percentage points in three independent polls.As the candidate a tea party favorite seeks to distance himself from fellow activists in Congress national Republican leaders are worried that a key office they expected to hold in a closely watched election is slipping away.AdvertisementThey also fear the shutdown could tarnish the party’s brand ahead of next year’s midterm election.Not all Republican candidates are suffering because of the shutdown. In Democratic New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie a GOP nonconformist is positioned to cruise to reelection.AdvertisementChristie is conservative but he has not allied himself with the tea party. Instead he has focused on issues that most concern voters such as the runaway costs of public employee benefits and he is moving ahead with President Obama’s healthcare law. The New Jersey governor shows little regard for how his policies affect score cards with activists on the right.“Republicans should think about these things as they ponder who to support in 2016” said strategist Steve Schmidt who ran Arizona Sen. John McCain’s presidential campaign in 2008. Schmidt sees the Virginia race as a cautionary tale for the party. “You have a campaign that has been unable to transcend its ideological baggage running against someone who would have been beatable with almost any other conceivable candidate.”AdvertisementCuccinelli also has the misfortune to be running in the state with the most federal workers. Analysts say the uneasiness many voters had with Cuccinelli’s tea party brand of Republicanism has solidified into outright opposition.“The shutdown is hurting Cuccinelli” said Quentin Kidd a professor of political science at Christopher Newport University in Newport News Va. For voters on the fence he said “it helped them make a decision. They thought ‘If that is the kind of thing we’d be looking at with Ken Cuccinelli then I am not interested.’”AdvertisementEstablishment Republicans are frustrated. The Democratic nominee Terry McAuliffe is a former chairman of the national party and is saddled with baggage.His business dealings have long attracted unflattering media attention including allegations that he cashed in on his Clinton-era political connections to grow his personal fortune. At the Democratic National Committee his fundraising tactics pushed ethical boundaries. He’s been compared to a carnival barker and a used car salesman.AdvertisementBut in a part of the country that has drifted from solidly red to solidly purple polls suggest the statewide electorate would sooner vote for a candidate who may strike them as smarmy than one allied with the Republican Party’s most extreme politicians.“I don’t like McAuliffe but I really don’t like Cuccinelli” said Cindy Freese 59 a retired reinsurance executive in Alexandria who is registered as an independent. Her husband is a federal employee poised to miss his mid-month paycheck. Freese said she would “absolutely” vote for a moderate Republican for governor “but there aren’t any anymore.”AdvertisementVirginia’s electoral landscape like that of the country overall has shifted amid an influx of immigrants and the growth of diverse suburbs. In last year’s presidential election the Obama campaign used those changing demographics to its advantage microtargeting voters with messaging that appealed to them. McAuliffe has recruited some of the data whizzes and strategists behind that effort to replicate it in Virginia.The Cuccinelli campaign represents the traditional approach. The candidate is the kind of firebrand conservative whom party activists believe energizes voters in the style of Ronald Reagan. As attorney general he fought to block Obama’s healthcare law. A climate change skeptic he started an investigation into a University of Virginia scientist whose research warned of a rise in temperatures. He has condemned homosexuality and sought to reinstate anti-sodomy laws rejected by the courts.AdvertisementThat record is not playing well with many Virginians uneasy with the rigid ideologies at the root of the shutdown. At a University of Richmond forum last week Cuccinelli avoided much of it.He lamented the refusal to compromise in Congress saying he opposes the shutdown. He said Republicans failed the country on healthcare by not doing anything to fix a broken system when they controlled the White House and Congress. Asked to name the biggest social policy on his agenda Cuccinelli responded “That isn’t what I am running on.”AdvertisementMcAuliffe reminded the audience that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) a current tea party favorite had just campaigned in Virginia for Cuccinelli. “The architect of the shutdown was here last week” McAuliffe said. “He and Ken Cuccinelli went to an event together. I wouldn’t have even been in the same room with Ted Cruz with all the damage he has done.”To be sure Cuccinelli’s stumble began before the shutdown. Federal investigators are looking into a business executive’s connections to Gov. Bob McDonnell and the inquiry has tainted the state party. Cuccinelli’s attacks on McAuliffe’s ethics were blunted when it came out that he had accepted $18000 in gifts from the businessman.AdvertisementBut it was only after federal employees were told not to report to work that McAuliffe nearly doubled his lead in the polls.“What has happened here reflects the challenges the GOP faces nationally” Virginia Lt.

       " 'I KNOW governor I know: It’s still too early for presidential speculation you’re just focused on the job at hand and any talk of 2016 while flattering is purely hypothetical.But just in case you do have some faint slight extremely modest interest in parlaying your landslide re-election into a presidential bid here are four 2016 “don’ts” to keep in mind:Don’t be Jon Huntsman. This sounds easy enough but obvious pitfalls are still worth pointing out. For the next two years you’re going to be hailed up and down the Acela Corridor as the Great Moderate Hope the anti-Tea Party candidate the Man Who Is Not Ted Cruz. But you can’t actively embrace that part or give off the impression — as Huntsman did obviously and fatally — that you agree with the media that your party’s full of rubes and cranks.As a would-be nominee you have to woo base voters not run against them and make them feel respected even when they disagree with you. This doesn’t mean muzzling yourself or pandering to every right-wing interest group. But it means persuading conservatives that you like them that you understand them and that as president you’re going to be (mostly) on their side.Don’t be Rudy Giuliani. You probably think you wouldn’t have Rudy’s problems in a Republican primary. Yes you’re both combative Northeasterners from the party’s moderate flank but unlike the former mayor you aren’t a social liberal with a public history of adultery (and a few drag performances thrown in).',\n",
       " 'This morning CNN had only released some of the results of their poll. Now they\\'ve released the second part and boy it\\'s a doozy for the GOP.In a sign of the political hangover congressional Republicans are suffering in the wake of the government shutdown three-quarters of Americans in a new national poll say that most GOP members of Congress don\\'t deserve to be re-elected. A CNN/ORC International survey released Monday also found a majority saying that the Republicans\\' policies are too extreme. And according to the poll Democrats have an 8-point advantage over the Republicans in an early indicator in the battle for control of Congress. But with more than a year to go until the 2014 midterm elections there\\'s plenty of time for these numbers to change. .... More than seven in 10 questioned in the survey said that most members of Congress don\\'t deserve to be re-elected with nearly four in 10 saying even their own representative doesn\\'t deserve a return ticket to Washington next year. Both figures are hovering around all-time highs in CNN polling. \"Although incumbent members of Congress of both parties are not very popular the shutdown seems to have only affected views of GOP incumbents\" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. Three-fourths of people questioned in the survey said that most congressional Republicans don\\'t deserved to be re-elected 21 percentage points higher than the 54% who say most Democrats don\\'t deserve another term in office. Only one in five say most Republicans deserve to be re-elected; 42% say the same thing about Democrats on Capitol Hill.Deserve re-election?Yes NoDem 40% 56%GOP 20% 76%Now this question was asked of all Americans and NOT of registered voters (and obviously not of likely voters). The CNN pollask it of registered voters as well and from the smaller sample registered voters were slightly more angry at both parties. Here I\\'ve put it in chart form.Of note that 40% for Democrats among registered voters is actually not the worst we\\'ve seen in recent history. The August 2010 numbers had only 36% of registered voters saying Democrats deserved re-election to Congress. However that 20% for the GOP is thein the poll\\'s history by far surpassing the previous low of just 31% taken back in August 2011 during the last debt ceiling fight.This is now spilling over into the generic ballot question as well.Fifty percent of registered voters questioned said they would vote for the Democrat in their district with 42% backing the Republican. The 8-point Democratic margin in the CNN poll is the same as in a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey and close to the 9-point advantage for the Democrats in the generic ballot in a recent Quinnipiac University poll. \"We\\'re a long way away from saying that the Democrats have a chance to regain control of the House\" Holland cautioned. \"There is more than a year to go before any votes are actually cast and the \\'generic ballot\\' question is not necessarily a good predictor of the actual outcome of 435 separate elections. A year before the 2010 midterms for example the Democrats held a 6-point lead on the generic ballot.\" The Republicans eventually won back control of the House in 2010 thanks to a historic 63-seat pickup.So again while the signs look good now they looked good for Democrats as well in 2010 and we all know the misery that followed. The generic ballot question almost always overestimates how well Democrats will do an entire year out from the actual election. Notice in 2006 a good year for Democrats it only overestimated by a tiny bit. But in the midterm years good for the GOP like 2002 and 2010 anyone thinking we were going to do OK because of the generic ballot question was in for a rude awakening. So recent history tells us that even if 2014 turns out to be a good year for Democrats the generic ballot question STILL overestimates how well we\\'re going to do a year ahead but only by a little.Notice in the 2010 average of the polls on October 21 2009 (exactly 4 years ago) Democrats held a 45%-39.5% advantage on the generic ballot question. And then a year later a massive 63-seat loss in the House with Republicans actually getting 51.6% of the vote and Democrats only getting 44.8% of the vote.So while this poll is good news don\\'t you dare take anything for granted just yet.',\n",
       " 'Obama: \\'I\\'m not going to see this again\\'Story highlights NEW: Michelle Obama wears a floor-length custom red gown designed by Jason Wu NEW: She and the president dance to Jennifer Hudson singing \"Let\\'s Stay Together\" \"Today is the day for all of us in this country to come together\" says a GOP leader A civil rights veteran struggles \"to keep from crying\" as Obama takes oath on MLK BibleIt was a seemingly wistful moment at the halfway mark of his presidency before the celebratory parade and the evening’s galas.Shortly after exhorting the United States to continue its “never-ending journey” to live up to the ideals of its founders on his way off the platform at the West Front of the Capitol President Barack Obama stopped to drink in the scene before him.“I want to take a look one more time” he told those surrounding him. “I’m not going to see this again.”And so with his oath of office taken – again – and the speech delivered the president stood aside for 24 seconds on the chilly Monday afternoon letting the crowd that had joined him for his formal public second inauguration file past.It was one of the few quiet moments on an otherwise jam-packed day. Obama stole another such moment with his wife at the first of two official inaugural balls they were scheduled to attend Monday night.Obamas party with 30000 close friendsFollowing performances by Alicia Keys Brad Paisley and the Mexican rock group Mana the first couple danced as Jennifer Hudson sang the classic song “Let’s Stay Together” by Al Green.First lady Michelle Obama wore a floor-length custom ruby-colored chiffon and velvet gown designed by Jason Wu the same designer behind her 2009 inaugural dress.The celebrations came a day after Obama was sworn in on the constitutionally required date in a low-key ceremony at the White House. The flag-waving crowd that watched Monday’s event was noticeably smaller than the throng that turned out for his first oath in 2009 but still packed the National Mall for blocks.The waving flags the red-white-and-blue bunting and the heralding trumpets marked the 57th such ceremony in the history of the nation with the peaceful extension of power based on last November’s election that returned Obama to the White House.The best Inauguration Day tweetsThe Sousa marches the ceremonial guns and the voices of James Taylor Kelly Clarkson and Beyonce having faded away Obama headed into the Capitol for a luncheon with members of Congress. Then he led the traditional parade up Pennsylvania Avenue stopping near the White House to walk a few blocks of the route with the first lady to the cheers of those lining the sidewalks.“You’ve got to come out for this” said Nick Pignone a Washington resident. “Everyone’s excited – good vibes right now.”Also publicly sworn in for a second term was Vice President Joe Biden who like Obama also took his official oath Sunday. Justice Sonia Sotomayor performed the honors for Biden at his home at the Naval Observatory in Washington where the vice president’s extended family and a few Cabinet officials gathered to watch the ceremony.Biden and his wife Jill also took some time to walk part of the parade route with a grinning Biden periodically jogging over to the sidelines to shake hands with people across the barricades. Once both couples and their families were seated at the White House reviewing stand one of the first acts to pass was the marching band from Honolulu’s Punahou School Obama’s alma mater.What followed included dozens of military and school bands Native American dance troupes whirling in traditional dress war veterans Civil War re-enactors kilted firefighters blowing bagpipes and Montana’s governor and congressional delegation on horseback and in cowboy hats.10 opinions: Explaining Obama’s speechObama the first African-American president and the 17th to win a second term used a pair of Bibles in Monday’s ceremony – one from Abraham Lincoln the other from Martin Luther King Jr. His roughly 2000-word inaugural address hearkened back to both.“I did everything possible today to keep from crying” said U.S. Rep. John Lewis D-Georgia a onetime lieutenant of King. He called the sight of Obama using King’s Bible “very moving unreal – almost unbelievable.”Monday is also the federal holiday commemorating the birthday of King who was assassinated in 1968.The loudest cheer of Obama’s address came when he said the nation’s journey remained incomplete “until our wives our mothers and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts” and “until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law.”Obama embraces key social justice movements in inaugural addressObama begins the second half of his presidency with the opportunity to make it more historic but facing some of the same challenges that he struggled with in the first four years.Americans “have the power to set this country’s course” he said urging people to fulfill their citizenship by meeting “the obligation to shape the debates of our time – not only with the votes we cast but with the voices we lift in defense of our most ancient values and enduring ideals.”On the Mall Carlos Arieta and his wife Sharon took in the scene after driving from Atlanta to witness history. The former Washington residents said it was the first time they had attended an inauguration.Surprised by the throngs gathered a few hours before the speech on a clear morning with temperatures just above freezing Arieta said “it’s nice to see all the different kinds of people.”Even some of those who didn’t support Obama’s November re-election turned out to watch. Don King 27 and his 21-year-old brother Matthew said they don’t agree with the president on taxation debt and other fiscal issues but didn’t want to miss this bit of history.“It’s the second inauguration for Obama and it’s pretty amazing if you think back to the 1800s and later during the civil rights era that we’re here” Don King said.Obamas Bidens participate in National Day of ServiceA new CNN/ORC International poll released Monday indicated less excitement this time than four years ago when nearly 2 million people crowded the Mall despite frigid weather for Obama’s historic first inauguration.In January 2009 nearly seven in 10 Americans questioned in a CNN survey said they were thrilled or happy that Obama was about to take office. Now according to the new that number is down 18 points to 50%.Back then six in 10 saw Obama’s inauguration as a celebration by all Americans of democracy in action with just 39% saying it was a political celebration by the supporters of the winning candidate.Now the numbers are nearly reversed with 62% saying the second inauguration is a celebration by those backing the president and 35% saying it’s a celebration of democracy.“The thrill is gone along with the hope that the start of a new presidential term of office will bring a divided nation together” said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.Gergen: Obama 2.0 – tougher wiser?Reality of second-term presidenciesThe smaller crowd this time around reflects the reality of second-term presidencies when the novelty and expectations of a new leader have been replaced with the familiarity and experiences of the first act.For Obama that difference is even sharper. His historic ascendancy to the White House in 2008 came with soaring public hopes and expectations for a new kind of governance that would close the vast partisan gulf developed in recent decades.However a litany of challenges including an inherited economic recession and repeated battles with congressional Republicans over budgets and spending only hardened the opposing positions in Washington.Obama’s signature achievements including major reforms of the health care industry and Wall Street became symbols of political division with opponents constantly accusing him of hindering needed economic recovery.Obama’s unfinished business and battles aheadFor his second term Obama has vowed to press for an overhaul of the nation’s immigration policies and new ways to boost the sputtering economy proposals that are bound to spark battles with his Republican rivals and oversee the implementation of Obamacare.And the shootings at a Connecticut elementary school last month put the divisive issue of gun control on his immediate agenda.CNN polling released Sunday showed a majority of Americans – 54% – believe Obama will be an outstanding or above average president in his second term while 43% said he’d be poor or below average.And while overall seven in 10 Americans hope the president’s policies succeed only four in 10 Republicans feel that way with 52% hoping that Obama will fail.Obama’s second-term prioritiesBut House Majority Leader Eric Cantor R-Virginia told CNN “Today is the day for all of us in this country to come together.”“I think the president did a fine job certainly laying out what he would like to see happen as far as the future of the country” Cantor said. “There are areas of disagreement but there are also some things fundamentally we agree on and that is this country is one of opportunity. And sort of the way we get there to help everybody there are some differences. Hopefully we can bridge those differences.”Four other priorities for the next four yearsCNN’s Jennifer Liberto Dana Bash Dana Davidsen Ashley Killough Paul Steinhauser Jessica Yellin Dan Lothian Brianna Keilar Kevin Liptak and Gregory Wallace contributed to this report.',\n",

Bennie Thompson D-Miss. criticized Obama for failing to name any African Americans among his early picks for his second-term Cabinet charging that the president \"has once again overlooked his most loyal constituency.\"And Rep. Marcia Fudge D-Ohio chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus also complained in a letter to Obama last month that his recent Cabinet nominees \"have hardly been reflective of this country\\'s diversity.\\'\\'Obama was even ribbed by the comedian Conan O\\'Brien at Saturday\\'s White House Correspondents Association\\'s annual dinner in Washington over the lack of diversity in his Cabinet.\"Mr. President your hair is so white it could be a member of your Cabinet\" O\\'Brien said.On Monday Fudge in a statement praised Obama\\'s pick and said that Foxx \"will surely be an asset to the President\\'s cabinet and to this nation.\" Meanwhile Thompson said he was \"pleased with this development\" but that he \"will continue to hold the president accountable for ensuring he has a diverse Cabinet.\"If confirmed by the Senate Foxx would become the second African American in Obama\\'s second-term Cabinet joining Attorney General Eric Holder and United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice both first term holdovers. Foxx would replace Ray LaHood who announced earlier this year that he was stepping down as Transportation secretary once his replacement cleared the Senate.The president has boasted of the diversity in his White House and urged critics not to judge the makeup of his Cabinet until he completed his picks. He still needs to nominate a Commerce secretary and U.S. trade representative.Ahead of Obama\\'s announcement Monday White House spokesman Jay Carney said that the president is \"pleased with the individuals who have agreed to accept his nominations for positions in the Cabinet.\"\"What you will see is a Cabinet that reflects the diversity of the country and the quality of people who are willing to serve their country in these important positions\" Carney said.Carl Tobias a law professor at the University of Richmond who studies federal nominations said Republicans will question Foxx\\'s short résumé on transportation issues but predicted he\\'ll sail through confirmation hearings. Foxx who was first elected Charlotte\\'s mayor in 2009 is a lawyer by training. He\\'s served on staff of the House Judiciary Committee and in the civil rights division of the Justice Department.\"The Republicans on this kind of appointment as opposed to something like secretary of Defense are more likely to defer to the president\" Tobias said.If confirmed Foxx will immediately face a budget fight and several contentious rules for consumer protection and safety.A week of furloughs at the Federal Aviation Administration which delayed thousands of flights prompted Congress to allow the agency to shift around funding amid spending cuts to end the furloughs.But the spending battle remains for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 because the Obama administration wants to close tax loopholes while trimming spending but congressional Republicans oppose new revenues.The Transportation Department is also developing a consumer-protection rule dealing with how airlines market services such as baggage fees and seat assignments.Consumer groups and travel agents are urging the department to force airlines to provide the prices for those services to the companies that allow comparisons at sites like Travelocity and Orbitz. But airlines are opposed to being forced to provide the information because comparison sites charge billions of dollars collectively each year.Two safety rules are also pending at the FAA in reaction to the last fatal crash of a commercial airliner in February 2009. One rule expected in August proposes to require as many training hours for co-pilots as pilots with exceptions for military pilots and those graduating from four-year colleges. The other rule expected in October will require more simulator training about how to recover from a stall.\"Without question our nation faces a number of transportation challenges that will require strong leadership and effective communication with Congress to keep our nation moving\" said Sen. John Thune the top Republican on the committee that will consider Foxx\\'s nomination.Contributing: Deborah Berry',\n",

       " 'You likely remember this but let\\'s just do some quick catching up. On Sept. 17 2012 Mother Jones released a video helped by former President Carter\\'s grandson of a private fundraiser for Mitt Romney. Here\\'s what the GOP presidential nominee said:There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what. All right there are 47 percent who are with him who are dependent upon government who believe that they are victims who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them who believe that they are entitled to health care to food to housing to you name it. That that\\'s an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what. And I mean the president starts off with 48 49 48—he starts off with a huge number. These are people who pay no income tax. Forty-seven percent of Americans pay no income tax. So our message of low taxes doesn\\'t connect. And he\\'ll be out there talking about tax cuts for the rich. I mean that\\'s what they sell every four years. And so my job is not to worry about those people—I\\'ll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.MORE FROM NATIONAL JOURNALThe remarks turned out to be quite damning. And now 10 months later there are new words from Mitt Romney trying to jedi mind trick the old ones all away.RELATED: 100% of New Obama Ads Are Talking About 47%In a Washington Post excerpt of Dan Balz\\'s upcoming book on the 2012 election Romney put forward one of his most adamant defenses of the 47 percent comments. Balz\\'s interview with Romney took place in late January 2013. Here\\'s Romney on what went through his head when he first heard about the video being released:As I understood it and as they described it to me not having heard it it was saying \\'Look the Democrats have 47 percent we\\'ve got 45 percent my job is to get the people in the middle and I\\'ve got to get the people in the middle.\\'... And I thought \\'Well that\\'s a reasonable thing.\\' ... It\\'s not a topic I talk about in public but there\\'s nothing wrong with it. They\\'ve got a bloc of voters we\\'ve got a bloc of voters I\\'ve got to get the ones in the middle. And I thought that that would be how it would be perceived — as a candidate talking about the process of focusing on the people in the middle who can either vote Republican or Democrat. As it turned out down the road it became perceived as being something very different.Story continuesCalling the idea behind the comments \"a reasonable thing\" is a bit off from Romney\\'s comments this June in which he told CNN that he was \"very upset\" over what he said. The new view of his remarks also pushed aside the idea that those 47 percent weren\\'t just \"Democrats\" but in Romney\\'s assessment were \"dependent upon government ... believe they are victims\" and that he\\'d never be able to \"convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.\"RELATED: James O\\'Keefe Is the Real Victim HereBalz specifically asked Romney about the \"personal responsibility\" remark. Mitt Romney said it was fiction:Actually I didn\\'t say that.... That\\'s how it began to be perceived and so I had to ultimately respond to the perception because perception is reality.Think of it as a \"sorry I\\'m not sorry.\" It\\'s also a fascinating one-sentence summation of how easy it is for a campaign aparatus to become an impenetrable bubble.RELATED: Scott Brown Goes All In on Warren\\'s Cherokee Pa-PawRomney then presented Balz with his own take on the event. Some of which is here:In two months my job is to get the people in the middle. But this was perceived as \\'Oh he\\'s saying 47 percent of the people he doesn\\'t care about or he\\'s insensitive to or they don\\'t care—they don\\'t take responsibility for their life.\\' No no. I\\'m saying 47 percent of the people don\\'t pay taxes and therefore they don\\'t warm to our tax message. But the people who are voting for the president my job isn\\'t to try and get them. My job is to get the people in the middle. And I go on and say that. Take a look. Look at the full quote. But I realized look perception is reality. The perception is I\\'m saying I don\\'t care about 47 percent of the people or something of that nature and that\\'s simply wrong.This doesn\\'t really mesh with the full quotation above from Mother Jones\\'s video transcript. Mother Jones\\'s David Corn was caught pretty surprised by the new comments. But Romney did realize one thing:Well clearly that was a very damaging quote and hurt my campaign effort.That\\'s a statement you don\\'t need much more context for.',\n",
       " 'RICHMOND Va. — Ken Cuccinelli is running for governor not Congress but the Virginia Republican is struggling to dodge the political fallout from Capitol Hill.His campaign in this crucial battleground state is in danger of becoming the first political casualty of the federal government shutdown which Americans largely blame on Republicans.AdvertisementWith the election just weeks away Cuccinelli’s poll numbers have tumbled since federal agencies were closed Oct. 1. The conservative state attorney general was already lagging but he went from within striking distance of a vulnerable Democrat to trailing by 8 to 10 percentage points in three independent polls.As the candidate a tea party favorite seeks to distance himself from fellow activists in Congress national Republican leaders are worried that a key office they expected to hold in a closely watched election is slipping away.AdvertisementThey also fear the shutdown could tarnish the party’s brand ahead of next year’s midterm election.Not all Republican candidates are suffering because of the shutdown. In Democratic New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie a GOP nonconformist is positioned to cruise to reelection.AdvertisementChristie is conservative but he has not allied himself with the tea party. Instead he has focused on issues that most concern voters such as the runaway costs of public employee benefits and he is moving ahead with President Obama’s healthcare law. The New Jersey governor shows little regard for how his policies affect score cards with activists on the right.“Republicans should think about these things as they ponder who to support in 2016” said strategist Steve Schmidt who ran Arizona Sen. John McCain’s presidential campaign in 2008. Schmidt sees the Virginia race as a cautionary tale for the party. “You have a campaign that has been unable to transcend its ideological baggage running against someone who would have been beatable with almost any other conceivable candidate.”AdvertisementCuccinelli also has the misfortune to be running in the state with the most federal workers. Analysts say the uneasiness many voters had with Cuccinelli’s tea party brand of Republicanism has solidified into outright opposition.“The shutdown is hurting Cuccinelli” said Quentin Kidd a professor of political science at Christopher Newport University in Newport News Va. For voters on the fence he said “it helped them make a decision. They thought ‘If that is the kind of thing we’d be looking at with Ken Cuccinelli then I am not interested.’”AdvertisementEstablishment Republicans are frustrated. The Democratic nominee Terry McAuliffe is a former chairman of the national party and is saddled with baggage.His business dealings have long attracted unflattering media attention including allegations that he cashed in on his Clinton-era political connections to grow his personal fortune. At the Democratic National Committee his fundraising tactics pushed ethical boundaries. He’s been compared to a carnival barker and a used car salesman.AdvertisementBut in a part of the country that has drifted from solidly red to solidly purple polls suggest the statewide electorate would sooner vote for a candidate who may strike them as smarmy than one allied with the Republican Party’s most extreme politicians.“I don’t like McAuliffe but I really don’t like Cuccinelli” said Cindy Freese 59 a retired reinsurance executive in Alexandria who is registered as an independent. Her husband is a federal employee poised to miss his mid-month paycheck. Freese said she would “absolutely” vote for a moderate Republican for governor “but there aren’t any anymore.”AdvertisementVirginia’s electoral landscape like that of the country overall has shifted amid an influx of immigrants and the growth of diverse suburbs. In last year’s presidential election the Obama campaign used those changing demographics to its advantage microtargeting voters with messaging that appealed to them. McAuliffe has recruited some of the data whizzes and strategists behind that effort to replicate it in Virginia.The Cuccinelli campaign represents the traditional approach. The candidate is the kind of firebrand conservative whom party activists believe energizes voters in the style of Ronald Reagan. As attorney general he fought to block Obama’s healthcare law. A climate change skeptic he started an investigation into a University of Virginia scientist whose research warned of a rise in temperatures. He has condemned homosexuality and sought to reinstate anti-sodomy laws rejected by the courts.AdvertisementThat record is not playing well with many Virginians uneasy with the rigid ideologies at the root of the shutdown. At a University of Richmond forum last week Cuccinelli avoided much of it.He lamented the refusal to compromise in Congress saying he opposes the shutdown. He said Republicans failed the country on healthcare by not doing anything to fix a broken system when they controlled the White House and Congress. Asked to name the biggest social policy on his agenda Cuccinelli responded “That isn’t what I am running on.”AdvertisementMcAuliffe reminded the audience that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) a current tea party favorite had just campaigned in Virginia for Cuccinelli. “The architect of the shutdown was here last week” McAuliffe said. “He and Ken Cuccinelli went to an event together. I wouldn’t have even been in the same room with Ted Cruz with all the damage he has done.”To be sure Cuccinelli’s stumble began before the shutdown. Federal investigators are looking into a business executive’s connections to Gov. Bob McDonnell and the inquiry has tainted the state party. Cuccinelli’s attacks on McAuliffe’s ethics were blunted when it came out that he had accepted $18000 in gifts from the businessman.AdvertisementBut it was only after federal employees were told not to report to work that McAuliffe nearly doubled his lead in the polls.“What has happened here reflects the challenges the GOP faces nationally” Virginia Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling said.AdvertisementA moderate Republican Bolling opted not to run for governor when the party decided to choose its candidate with a convention not an election at the behest of activists seeking to ensure the nominee would be loyal to the base.“Now” he said “Democrats have been able to use the shutdown to remind mainstream Virginia voters about what their concerns are: Would Ken Cuccinelli be able to govern in a mainstream way? Or would he govern the state in the style you are seeing in D.C.?”Advertisementevan.halper@latimes.com',\n",
       " 'Climate change:By Neela BanerjeeAdvertisementWASHINGTON -- In his State of the Union address President Obama articulated a subtle but noticeable shift away from his longstanding discussion of climate change in almost entirely economic terms to making a moral argument for the need to act.“For the sake of our children and our future” he said “we must do more to combat climate change.”Advertisement“Yes it’s true that no single event makes a trend” Obama said. “But the fact is the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15. Heat waves droughts wildfires and floods -- all are now more frequent and intense. We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy and the most severe drought in decades and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence. Or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science -- and act before it’s too late.”His new blunter language on climate change builds on rhetoric he used during the Democratic National Convention in his election night victory speech and his Inaugural address three weeks ago. Obama did not follow up his mention of climate change by unveiling any new major initiatives. But he told legislators that with or without them he would act on it.Advertisement“I urge this Congress to pursue a bipartisan market-based solution to climate change like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago” Obama said speaking of the Senate veterans. “But if Congress won’t act soon to protect future generations I will. I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take now and in the future to reduce pollution prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy.”The president has public opinion on his side with polls late last year showing that a majority of Americans now consider climate change a serious problem. He also has initiatives at the ready that were being crafted toward the end of his first term most notably rules to curtail greenhouse gas emissions from new power plants.AdvertisementEnvironmentalists praised Obama’s new approach but key decisions ahead are likely to test his commitment. Environmentalists hope to see the administration reject the building of the Keystone XL pipeline which they say would amp up greenhouse gases. They also expect the Environmental Protection Agency to push new rules to cut emissions of greenhouse gases from existing power plants.“He was strong on problems but weak on solutions after saying climate change was a moral crisis and an economic opportunity” said Michael Brune president of the Sierra Club. “He didn’t give us much to chew on as far as meeting the challenge.”AdvertisementMinimum wage:By Jim PuzzangheraWASHINGTON -- President Obama focused his State of the Union address on boosting the nation’s slow-moving economic recovery saying the first priority “is making America a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing.”AdvertisementObama unveiled some new initiatives such as raising the minimum wage opening new government-backed Manufacturing Innovation Institutes and a program to fix crumbling infrastructure.He also pushed lawmakers to approve proposals that stalled in Congress last year including making it easier for some homeowners to refinance their mortgages eliminating some corporate tax breaks and enacting the so-called Buffett Rule to ensure that millionaires pay a minimum income tax rate.Advertisement“Now is our best chance for bipartisan comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit” Obama said. “The American people deserve a tax code that helps small businesses spend less time filling out complicated forms and more time expanding and hiring.”The most significant new proposal was to raise the national minimum wage in stages to $9 an hour by 2015 from $7.25 and to tie the rate to inflation.Advertisement“This single step would raise the income of millions of working families” Obama said. “For businesses across the country it would mean customers with more money in their pockets.”Obama also proposed a $50-billion program called “Fix-It-First” that would hire people to repair nearly 70000 structurally deficient bridges nationwide and other infrastructure.AdvertisementIn addition the president said he would use existing money to open three new Manufacturing Innovation Institutes after the success of the first such facility in Youngstown Ohio where an unused warehouse has been converted into a state-of-the art 3D printing lab. Obama called for Congress to authorize $1 billion to create a network of 15 such institutes.Gun control:By Melanie MasonWASHINGTON — Much of President Obama’s rhetoric on gun violence in his State of the Union address focused on a seemingly basic appeal to Congress: hold a vote.AdvertisementHis repeated refrain that victims of gun violence “deserve a vote” served as the speech’s emotional crescendo. But it also underscored just how daunting is the legislative path facing gun control. Congress has not held floor votes on major changes to gun laws since the 1990s.Obama made cursory mentions of the components of his gun policy proposals: universal background checks a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and stronger anti-trafficking laws.Advertisement“Each of these proposals deserves a vote in Congress. If you want to vote no that’s your choice” Obama said. “But these proposals deserve a vote. Because in the two months since Newtown more than a thousand birthdays graduations and anniversaries have been stolen from our lives by a bullet from a gun.”One of those lives he noted was that of Hadiya Pendleton a 15-year-old who marched in his inaugural parade last month. One week later she was killed in Chicago an unintended victim of gun violence.Advertisement“Hadiya’s parents Nate and Cleo are in this chamber tonight along with more than two dozen Americans whose lives have been torn apart by gun violence. They deserve a vote” Obama said.Her parents sitting next to First Lady Michelle Obama listened somberly. Hadiya’s mother Cleopatra Cowley-Pendleton flashed a brief smile at the president’s mention of her daughter’s love of Fig Newtons and lip gloss.AdvertisementThe president continued: “Gabby Giffords deserves a vote. The families of Newtown deserve a vote. The families of Aurora deserve a vote. The families of Oak Creek and Tucson and Blacksburg and the countless other communities ripped open by gun violence – they deserve a simple vote.”The chorus was picked up by lawmakers mostly Democrats who chanted “vote vote.” Many in the hall in both parties wore green ribbons in show of support for Newtown Conn. the site of a mass shooting at an elementary school in December.AdvertisementA number of Democratic lawmakers also invited victims of gun violence and their loved ones as guests. Rep. Janice Hahn (D-San Pedro) brought the Rev. E. Winford Bell a Los Angeles-based Baptist pastor who founded a faith-based anti-violence organization after his son was injured in a 2009 shooting. Hahn said Bell and others could prod her colleagues in Congress to act.“Sometimes the president will have one issue and he’ll have one person in the gallery stand up” Hahn said. “This time there [are] a lot of people who are guests who have suffered from gun violence. And I think that is a powerful message and voice for Congress.”AdvertisementJob creation through minimum wage hikes:By Don LeeWASHINGTON -- Many mom-and-pop businesses were among the most vocal critics of President Obama’s healthcare overhaul as being too costly and now they’re likely to howl at his latest proposal: an increase in the federal minimum wage.But the proposal drew immediate praise from unions and worker advocacy groups. And the idea is likely to find support from many newly hired workers in this tough recovery.AdvertisementSince early 2010 when the economy began to create jobs about one-third of the 6 million private-sector jobs added to the economy have been in three sectors that pay relatively low wages: restaurants retail trade and temporary help.Obama in his state of the union message called for a boost in the minimum pay rate to $9 an hour from the current $7.25 and to tie that to a cost of living increase saying that “in the wealthiest nation on Earth no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty.”A single person who works full-time today in a minimum-wage job would gross about $15100 which is above the federal poverty line. Congress last passed a minimum-wage increase in 2007 and Obama noted that since then 19 states had bumped up their minimum hourly pay rates.In reviving a proposal that he made as a presidential candidate in 2008 Obama probably got strong support from his chief economic advisor Alan Krueger whose research findings have poked holes in the commonly held view that increasing the minimum wage leads to higher joblessness.AdvertisementStill the president’s new push for a minimum wage increase is likely to draw fire from many who believe it will hurt the economy especially small businesses which as a whole have lagged behind in growth and hiring during this recovery.Immigration reform:By Brian BennettAdvertisementWASHINGTON – President Obama pressed Congress to overhaul immigration laws “in the next few months” during his State of the Union speech but he did not dwell on the issue a signal that he doesn’t want to upset delicate negotiations unfolding in the House and the Senate.“Let’s get this done” Obama said several times as the chamber cheered. “Send me a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the next few months and I will sign it right away.”AdvertisementMarshall Fitz an immigration expert at the Center for American Progress a liberal think tank said Obama wanted to give Congress time to negotiate and draft a bill.“There’s an awareness on his part that too much involvement can hurt the process” he said.AdvertisementObama wove his immigration remarks into his larger proposals to stimulate the economy and create jobs. He emphasized that prominent business and labor leaders have said “the time has come” to pass an immigration bill.Obama repeated his call for a bill that includes additional border security measures and creates a pathway to “earned” citizenship for those who pass a law enforcement check pay back taxes and a penalty and learn English.AdvertisementThe effort to forge a compromise has tacit support from Republican leaders in Congress who see reaching out to Latino families as important for the future of the GOP. But some Republicans are staunchly opposed to expanding legal immigration and are unlikely to agree to offering legal status to illegal immigrants.“If the president was serious about creating jobs and spurring economic growth amnesty for illegal immigrants would not be on his agenda” Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas) said in a statement Tuesday.AdvertisementSmith who has voted to reduce legal immigration levels for more than two decades said the president’s proposal which Obama outlined in a Jan. 29 speech in Las Vegas “will make it easier for 11 million illegal immigrants to compete with hard-pressed American workers.”Efforts to hammer out a compromise have accelerated in both the House and the Senate in recent weeks.AdvertisementIn the Senate a bipartisan group of four Democrats and four Republicans has begun meeting twice a week. Aides are drafting a bill that includes a route to legal status and more visas for highly skilled or highly educated applicants.The Democrats – Sen. Charles E. Schumer of New York Richard J. Durbin of Illinois Bob Menendez of New Jersey and Michael Bennet of Colorado – are scheduled to meet Obama on Wednesday afternoon to brief him on the group’s progress.AdvertisementObama has said he wants to see the Senate introduce an immigration reform bill next month. If he doesn’t he has promised to send his own version to the Senate and ask the chamber to vote on it. Activists say that could poison the spirit of cooperation now underway.Obama has been “really clear… that he’s not going to wait forever” said Fitz who was in a group of immigration advocates and labor leaders who met with the president in the West Wing last week. “This isn’t going to get dragged into a back room and be allowed to die a slow and ugly death.”AdvertisementEducational programs:By Howard BlumePresident Obama focused Tuesday night on the ends of the education spectrum — preschool and college. He said in his State of the Union address that his administration would work with states to provide a high-quality preschool program for all. He said only 3 of 10 children currently enroll in such programs which he said were proven to increase graduation rates and reduce teen pregnancy rates and violent crime.AdvertisementThere has been controversy however over the success of federally funded Head Start programs which critics have said are not of consistently high quality. There’s also a persistent debate over whether early childhood programs should focus on academic skills or developing creativity and social skills. Either way the president is likely to meet with resistance if a preschool initiative means a substantial new outlay of federal funds.Obama also compared American high school graduates with their German peers who he said can leave high school with the equivalent of a community college degree. Obama was not specific about how he would accomplish the same in the United States although he said there are model programs in this country to emulate.AdvertisementOne of his most interesting and specific proposals dealt with colleges.“Colleges must do their part to keep costs down” Obama said echoing campaign themes voiced by himself and Republican opponent Mitt Romney during the presidential race.AdvertisementOn Tuesday Obama said he wanted to link federal funding to the affordability and value a college offers. And he said the administration is prepared to roll out a score card listing which schools do and do not offer the most “bang for the educational buck.”Follow Politics Now on Twitter and Facebook',\n",

       " 'Even before President Barack Obama unveiled his sweeping climate change plan on Tuesday Republican leaders were denouncing the effort as a job-killer. Any move to restrict polluting carbon dioxide emissions from power plants they maintained would send energy costs up and lead to mass layoffs in a vital job sector.At a press conference last Thursday House Majority Leader John Boehner (R-Ohio) blasted the expected proposal as “absolutely crazy.”“Why would you want to increase the cost of energy and kill more American jobs at a time when the American people are still asking where are the jobs?” he asked.But experts who have studied the intersection of environmental policy and the job market say there\\'s little truth to this claim if any.Such assertions are \"wildly overstated\" said Richard Revesz the director of the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University. He framed Boehner\\'s remark as the latest iteration of a “job-killer meme” that has surfaced frequently in recent years as Republicans have sought to drum up fears about Obama’s environmental efforts.“We hear often that large swaths of the economy will be wiped out due to one regulation or another” Revesz said. “Fortunately and not surprisingly we don\\'t see those predictions coming true.”In a comprehensive 2012 review of more than 25 studies that attempted to gauge the effect of environmental regulations on jobs a team of researchers led by Revesz found that many claims about such regulations were unreliable.While studies commissioned by the coal industry warned that millions of jobs could be lost others conducted by left-leaning think tanks and environmental groups predicted that millions of jobs would be gained their survey found.By contrast the most detailed studies concluded that job losses and gains from environmental regulations essentially balanced out. \"When serious studies have been done the impacts tend to be small -- sometimes positive sometimes negative but small\" Revesz said.Obama said Tuesday that he would use his executive powers to place limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. The plan is the most ambitious effort by a U.S. president to address climate change to date and includes $8 billion in loan guarantees for clean energy projects such as efforts to trap and store carbon dioxide emitted by coal-burning power plants.One company that stands to benefit from the plan is Neumann Systems Group based in Colorado Springs Colo. The company recently won a $73.5 million contract to apply its liquid-based emissions scrubbing technology to a local power plant that is under construction. Todd Tiahrt Neumann\\'s CEO said the technology could also be used to retrofit older plants at a cost of about $150 million for an average-sized facility.Tiahrt said he expected Obama\\'s proposal would spur growth in his field and that in five years his operation could employ 500 engineers. But he also worried that new regulations would single out coal plants for closure even though they are hardly the only carbon polluters.\"My initial reaction is this amounts to an unfair segregation of the coal industry\" he said.Coal plants are still proliferating across the world Tiahrt said and any initiative to curb their use in the United States would also inhibit the growth of businesses like his that are developing methods to make coal clean.Perhaps sensing this paradox Democrats seem to be pulling back on their attempts to directly counter Republicans\\' jobs fears and portray climate regulations as boons to the job market.The policy paper that accompanied Obama\\'s announcement mentions potential job growth stemming from the proposed measures six separate times but it avoids any specifics such as what types of jobs might be created and in which industries.Indeed the only specific job-growth number in the report refers to an \"estimated\" 17000 jobs created at 50 solar and wind farms and geothermal plants approved by the Department of Energy since 2009.This reluctance to be predictive could be a sign the administration wants to bury a boast Obama made while on the campaign trail in 2008. If elected president he pledged he would invest in green-energy technology that would yield 5 million jobs.The best opportunity at realizing that goal came in 2009 when the massive stimulus approved by Congress provided $90 billion in loans tax credits and other measures for increasing clean energy production and bolstering public transit.Even the most vocal supporters of the stimulus acknowledge that the investment didn\\'t create many jobs. Robert Pollin a former Energy Department official who was tasked with tabulating jobs stemming from the stimulus said his \"best guess\" is that 240000 green jobs were created from 2009 to 2011.But while those green-energy efforts may not have boosted the job market they weren\\'t job-killers either Revesz noted. And all things considered he said Obama\\'s newly proposed climate rules are likely to do more good than harm.\"With the health benfits and environmental benefits are strong as they are it\\'s really clear to us that we as a nation are better off with these regulations\" he said.',\n",
       " '8 years ago(CNN) - Call it the bromance part two.President Barack Obama and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie team up Tuesday to survey recovery efforts along the Jersey shore seven months after Superstorm Sandy slammed into the Garden State and neighboring New York causing billions in damage.The destructive storm hit the northeast just over a week before last November\\'s presidential election forcing both Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney to put their campaigns on hold briefly while the heavily-populated region recovered.The president traveled to New Jersey a few days after Sandy hit to observe federal recovery efforts touring the damage with Christie who at the time was a top Romney surrogate.Standing next to the president Christie praised Obama saying \"I cannot thank the president enough for his personal concern and compassion for our state and for the people of our state.\"Some political pundits say that the storm which put the campaign on hold and the federal government\\'s response to the storm were a couple of the many contributing factors that helped the president win re-election just a few days later. While Christie\\'s own approval rating in New Jersey soared after Sandy and has remained high to date as he runs for re-election this year some commentators in his own party blasted him for his praise of Obama.“He’s fat and a fool. Don’t listen to Governor Christie. He doesn’t know what he’s talking about” said conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh.Christie himself dismissed the critics saying his actions after the storm weren\\'t in any way motivated by politics – including a potential bid for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination. He reiterated that mindset last week saying on NBC\\'s \"Today\" he wasn\\'t worried about how Obama\\'s visit might affect his political future.\"If the president wants to come back here and see the progress himself I never worry about that stuff\" Christie said Friday morning.\" \"I worry about doing my job.\"\"The bottom line is you can\\'t experience the way you\\'re experiencing it right now unless you\\'re here and you see it for yourself\" Christie added. \"The fact of the matter is he\\'s president of the United States and if he wants to see the people of New Jersey I\\'m the governor and I\\'ll be here to welcome him.\"Christie political adviser Mike DuHaime said the governor was putting his constituents\\' needs ahead of partisan politics.\"Governor Christie has always put the best interests of the people who elected him first well ahead of any political calculations\" DuHaime said. \"If some people do not agree with putting your constituents first in a time of crisis and natural disaster then so be it. He will always put the people who elected him first.\"In New Jersey Obama and Christie will tour areas hit hard by last year\\'s storm which caused an estimated $38 billion in damage to the Garden State. Hundreds of thousands of homes were either damaged or destroyed with many ocean-front businesses also sustaining significant harm from the high winds and storm surge.Those businesses on the Jersey Shore are still working to recover at the beginning of the busy summer tourist season which in years past has brought billions of dollars in revenue to the state.Millions have been spent rebuilding boardwalks and restoring destroyed businesses but thinner crowds are expected this summer as towns continue to work toward getting back to normal.In Asbury Park the iconic hometown of Bruce Springsteen Obama will deliver remarks and \"highlight the extensive rebuilding efforts to date\" the White House said.They added Obama will \"underscore his administration\\'s ongoing commitment to stand with the impacted communities as the important work of recovery continues.\"\"It\\'s a pretty vivid illustration about the president\\'s commitment to seeing these things through\" deputy press secretary Josh Earnest said Sunday.\"The president made a promise in the aftermath of that storm that he would continue to focus on that recovery effort and that the federal government would continue to focus on that recovery effort long after the nation\\'s attention or at least the media\\'s attention had turned elsewhere\" Earnest added.Even as Christie enjoys a healthy lead over his Democratic rival in this year\\'s governor\\'s race many wonder how his public embrace of Obama - both last fall and now - will affect his presidential chances in 2016. Christie who has said he\\'s not interested in running for president is nonetheless widely speculated to be a potential candidate.Rich Galen a GOP political analyst who advised Fred Thompson during his 2008 presidential bid said Christie has a number of \"institutional problems\" aside from his relationship with Obama. He hails from the East Coast and doesn\\'t particularly align with the GOP\\'s major factions.\"That being said if it looks two years down the road like he can win and no one else can all else will be forgiven\" Galen said. \"Obama\\'s not running again but Christie is so I suspect that other than the ideologues he\\'ll be fine.\"\"Republicans are still furious at Governor Christie but not as mad as they are at President Obama\" noted GOP strategist Alex Castellanos. \"If Christie demonstrates that he can wrest the White House back for Republicans and reverse the leftward shift of Obama\\'s 8 years many Republicans will forgive his sins.\"Tuesday\\'s trip will mark the second time in just three days Obama has traveled to the site of a natural disaster – he toured tornado-inflicted damage in Moore Oklahoma on Sunday and encouraged further Congressional support for programs that bolster emergency management systems for municipalities.\"Training education both for citizenry but also for first responders is absolutely critical\" Obama said. \"And we\\'ve got to make sure that those resources remain in place. So I know everybody in Congress cares deeply about what\\'s happening and I\\'m confident that resources will be forthcoming when it comes to rebuilding.\"Obama praised the Federal Emergency Management Agency for its quick response to the Moore tornado just as he did last fall when Sandy struck the East Coast. Long the object of scorn for its missteps in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina FEMA has been commended by localities for responding quickly to disasters and reducing some of the bureaucratic hurdles of the past.',\n",
       " 'President Obama\\'s pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency is already running into resistance from the fossil fuel industry over concerns that she would escalate a \"war\" on oil coal and natural gas.EPA veteran Gina McCarthy was one of three nominees Obama announced at the White House late Monday morning. He also tapped MIT scientist Ernest Moniz to head the Energy Department and Walmart\\'s Sylvia Mathews Burwell as his next budget chief.All will have to undergo Senate confirmation. And McCarthy -- given her background and the controversial nature of the agency she wants to lead -- could face the toughest screening.\"Today\\'s announcement that the president wants Gina McCarthy to serve as the next EPA administrator is a clear indication that the administration will continue a war on affordable energy\" Thomas Pyle president of the Institute for Energy Research said in a statement.\"Throughout her career McCarthy has implemented policies that attempt to constrain the use of reliable energy sources. ... It appears the president is rewarding these efforts by increasing her ability to implement an ideological and political agenda. If confirmed as EPA administrator McCarthy will continue the regulatory attack on oil coal and natural gas with the result that Americans will experience increasing energy costs and high unemployment rates.\"McCarthy led the Office of Air and Radiation and in that role oversaw regulations that some in the domestic energy industry blame for lost coal jobs.Key were first-ever regulations on greenhouse gas emissions out of new power plants. That followed new controls on mercury emissions.Sen. James Inhofe R-Okla. said the nomination makes clear that Obama \"wants to continue pursuing an aggressive climate agenda at EPA.\"Environmental and air quality advocates though credit McCarthy with helping implement rules that could curb everything from asthma attacks to heart attacks.Obama described McCarthy as someone who could balance smart environmental regulation and economic growth. He said that at the EPA so far she has pursued \"practical cost-effective ways to keep our air clean and our economy growing.\"\"She has earned a reputation as a straight-shooter\" Obama said Monday. \"I\\'m confident that she is going to do an outstanding job.\"The nominations Monday preceded Obama\\'s first Cabinet meeting of his second term. They also signal that the White House is trying to get back to normal business after the president and Congress failed to avert the $85 billion in automatic spending cuts that started taking effect Friday. While the president has warned of dire consequences for the economy as a result of the cuts the White House does not want the standoff with Congress to keep the president from focusing on other second term priorities including filling out his Cabinet as well as pursuing stricter gun laws and an overhaul of the nation\\'s immigration system.His nominee for the budget office Burwell is a Washington veteran having served as OMB\\'s deputy director in the Clinton administration and chief of staff to former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. She currently runs the Walmart Foundation the retail giant\\'s philanthropic wing and previously served as president of the Gates Foundation\\'s Global Development Program.The White House official credited Burwell with being a principal architect of a series of budget plans in the 1990s that led to a budget surplus.Walmart president Mike Duke called Burwell a strong leader with a \"clear vision for making big things happen.\"\"She understands business and the role that business government and civil society must play to build a strong economy that provides opportunity and strengthens communities across the country\" Duke said in a statement.The Associated Press contributed to this report.',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON — The Obama administration is considering a sweeping initiative to address climate change including the first-ever limits on carbon dioxide from power plants the country’s biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions according to people familiar with the discussions.The White House has yet to settle on specific measures but “we’re hearing that existing power plants are definitely in the mix” said a person with knowledge of the deliberations who like others asked not to be identified to talk about White House discussions. An announcement could come by mid-July.AdvertisementPower plants account for about a third of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions with most of the carbon dioxide coming from coal-fired plants and to a lesser extent natural gas generation. Issuing rules to curtail their pollution would almost certainly touch off a battle in the courts and Congress.“There are only a few substantive meaningful actions the administration can take short of dealing with existing power plants” said S. William Becker executive director of the National Assn. of Clean Air Agencies a group of local and state air pollution regulators. “So I’d be extremely surprised if existing power plants weren’t one of the top priorities the administration is pursuing.”AdvertisementThe White House declined to comment on the deliberations instead citing President Obama’s past comments on climate change. The Edison Electric Institute the power industry’s trade group also declined to comment.Still Heather Zichal White House deputy assistant for energy and climate change said at an environmental conference in Washington last week that “in the coming weeks and months you can expect to hear more from the president on this issue.”AdvertisementAt the start of his second term Obama identified climate change as one of his top priorities along with immigration and the federal deficit. But then the administration appeared to pull back. Long-awaited final rules to limit greenhouse gases from new power plants have been delayed and the White House has been silent on any plan to control emissions from existing power plants.But in recent weeks the administration has begun to move on its climate agenda. Most notably Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced recently that the countries would phase down and eventually halt the production and use of hydrofluorocarbons potent heat-trapping gases used as chemical refrigerants in air conditioners and other appliances. The United States and China now plan to work to get other countries in particular India to join the effort.AdvertisementThree years ago Obama pledged that the U.S. would lower its greenhouse gas emissions to 17% less than 2005 levels by 2020. The administration’s fuel economy rules for motor vehicles have helped rein in emissions. Carbon dioxide output has also fallen because the economy slowed and cleaner-burning natural gas plants are replacing coal-fired plants. Yet the U.S. cannot meet that target without enacting new regulations or laws according to analysts and regulators.Republican lawmakers have largely rejected the idea that human activity has caused climate change precluding the chance of passing new legislation. As a result the administration has to act on its own.AdvertisementRep. Edward Whitfield (R-Ky.) chairman of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on energy and power could not be reached for comment.But to make a deep dent in carbon dioxide emissions the administration would have to tackle the politically touchy subject of power plants. Any rule issued by the Environmental Protection Agency would no doubt trigger a lawsuit by opponents. Congress could also try to attach riders to spending bills that would stop funding for greenhouse gas standards said Daniel J. Weiss director of climate strategy at the Center for American Progress Action Fund.AdvertisementThe EPA could make new power plant rules more palatable if it avoided a one-size-fits-all approach Becker said. The states would have to enforce the standards. The EPA could work with states to set up target reductions of greenhouse gases for each state. A state with many coal plants such as Ohio might not be able to meet its target as fast as a state such as Washington which relies greatly on hydroelectricity.Environmentalists and regulators said a new climate initiative might contain energy efficiency programs and efforts to eliminate leaks of methane another potent greenhouse gas from oil and gas drilling operations and pipelines.Advertisement“This is an important issue to the president. It’s a question of his legacy” said Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Beverly Hills) ranking member on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. “Five years from now people will be talking about what the Obama administration did on climate change not entitlements or the deficit or whatever they are talking about now.

       " 'Many experts have found evidence of a strong correlation between tolerance and prosperity particularly in high-tech sectors. One of them the author Richard Florida has identified the “three T’s” — talent technology and tolerance — as the fundamental basis for the growth of new economies.With a high concentration of outstanding colleges and universities Rhode Island certainly has the talent. The technology is there as well with our state’s broadband speed and coverage ranked among the nation’s best. The Beacon Hill Institute’s most recent State Competitiveness Report also placed Rhode Island fifth among all states in the technology category. Now we are poised to adopt the third and final T: tolerance.The point is not simply that we are welcoming to gay people though we are. It is that we want to welcome everyone. The talented workers who are driving the new economy — young educated and forward-looking — want to live in a place that reflects their values. They want diversity not simply out of a sense of justice but because diversity makes life more fun. Why would any state turn away the people who are most likely to create the economies of the 21st century?I have been heartened in recent months to see members of my old party coming around on marriage equality including the entire Republican caucus in the Rhode Island Senate — the first time a caucus of either party has been unanimous in its support. That reflects sound political judgment and some values that are at least as Republican as they are Democratic including a belief in marriage as an institution and a desire to keep government out of our personal lives.The push for equality will continue to grow stronger in statehouses courthouses and polling places in every state in America. This is by and large a generational issue not a geographic one. Even in the reddest states the rising generations are far more tolerant than their parents and grandparents. As this shift continues marriage equality will inevitably become law in more and more states. The states that cling to their old prohibitions will then be viewed as the outliers. Like Rhode Island in recent years they will be seen as islands of old thinking.This is also true more broadly at the national level. The United States is at a competitive disadvantage in attracting skilled workers to fill high-level jobs in technology finance and health care as noted by industry leaders and Wall Street executives at Monday’s annual “Out on the Street” conference. It is my hope that the Supreme Court will choose to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act and that my fellow governors will lobby their Congressional delegations to address our country’s discriminatory policies at the federal level.So tomorrow when I sign the Marriage Equality Act into law I will be thinking of the Rhode Islanders who have fought for decades simply to be able to marry the person they love. I will be thinking of how Rhode Island is upholding its legacy as a place founded on the principles of tolerance and diversity. But I will also be thinking as all governors must about the economy. With marriage equality becoming law tomorrow night in Rhode Island we are sending a clear message that we are open for business and that all are welcome. I hope that leaders in capitals across the country — including Washington — will soon realize that marriage equality is an issue where doing the right thing and the smart thing are one and the same.',\n",
       " \"Story highlights NEW: President Obama says gun violence harms economic growth He awards Presidential Citizens Medals posthumously to educators killed in Newtown The NRA opposes Obama's gun plan as a step toward unconstitutional restrictions An expert on urban crime says the president's package would helpPresident Barack Obama said Friday that children from communities wracked by poverty and violence need help from the government schools family and clergy to have a chance to climb “ladders of opportunity” to reach the middle class and beyond.Speaking at a Chicago high school near where he used to live Obama cited gun violence that killed 443 people in the city last year as one reason why children need community wide support to help them believe they can improve their lives through education and hard work.“In too many neighborhoods today whether here in Chicago or the farthest reaches of rural America it can feel like for a lot of young people the future only extends to the next street corner or the outskirts of town” he said adding “that no matter how much you work or how hard you try your destiny was determined the moment you were born.”Making his third campaign-style appearance in three days Obama again emphasized proposals from Tuesday’s State of the Union address such as raising the minimum wage to $9 an hour and providing good pre-schooling for every child as necessary to help people better themselves.The president also called for Congress to vote on a package of gun proposals aimed at decreasing shootings like ones that occur daily on streets and in homes as well as mass killings in recent months at a school a movie theater and even a place of worship.According to the Centers of Disease Control there were 11078 homicides by firearm in the United States in 2010 and 7220 of the victims – 65% – were aged 15-34. In addition 6151 – or 56% – were African American a demographic that comprises about 13% of the total U.S. population.“This is not just a gun issue” he continued. “It’s also an issue of the kinds of communities that we’re building and for that we all share responsibility as citizens to fix it.”It all starts at home the president said calling “strong stable families” and “loving supportive parents” the most important ingredients for reducing violence.Noting he was raised by a single mother he called for promoting marriage and encouraging fatherhood saying he wished he had a father around and involved when he was a boy.“By the way that’s all kinds of parents” he added drawing applause when he specified “it includes gay or straight parents.”He acknowledged the challenge saying “it will not be easy but it can be done.”“No solution we offer will be perfect” he said. “But perfection has never been our goal. Our goal has been to try and make whatever difference we can.”Obama headed to his hometown after a White House ceremony Friday morning to award the Presidential Citizens Medal – the nation’s second-highest civilian honor – to 18 people. They included posthumous honors for six educators killed along with 20 first-graders in December’s Connecticut school massacre.The president hugged family members of the slain teachers and administrators from Sandy Hook Elementary School in presenting the medals saying: “We could not be more grateful to your loved ones who gave everything they had” for the children in their care.In his remarks later at Chicago’s Hyde Park Academy High School Obama mentioned Hadiya Pendleton 15 who was killed by gunfire in the city last month after returning from taking part in inaugural activities in Washington.Pendleton’s parents were in the crowd Friday just as they were at the State of the Union as guests of first lady Michelle Obama who attended Hadiya’s funeral.The president said his package of gun measures was intended to save young lives and that “they deserve a vote” repeating the phrase a few times as he did in Tuesday’s address at the Capitol.Chicago’s record murder rate: Don’t blame guns aloneFierce opposition by the National Rifle Association makes passage of any significant gun legislation uncertain. In response to Obama’s State of the Union address the NRA has sought to discredit the motives and impacts of legislation proposed by the president and Democrats.“They only care about their decades-old gun control agenda — ban every gun they can tax every gun sold and register every gun owner” NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre said in a statement on Thursday. “This president has taken the art of public deception and manipulation to a whole new level.”Obama seeks an updated version of the 1994 assault weapons ban which expired in 2004 that would prevent the manufacture and sale of some semi-automatic rifles modeled after fully automatic assault weapons.Obama’s emotional plea might lead to vote on gunsHe also proposes limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds expanding background checks to all gun transactions including sales at gun shows. In addition the president wants Congress to take steps to better screen people with mental illnesses so they cannot obtain weapons.Legislation proposed so far also would crack down on so-called straw purchases in which a legal buyer purchases weapons for distribution to non-legal buyers.The NRA and other opponents argue the Democratic proposals are veiled attempts to limit gun ownership and eventually take away weapons and therefore violate the constitutional right to bear arms.In particular opponents contend the proposed ban on semi-automatic rifles focuses on a weapon used in a tiny percentage of killings and other gun violence.Opinion: Chicago’s violence took my dad friendsHarold Pollack co-director of the University of Chicago Crime Lab confirmed on Friday that so-called assault weapons targeted by the proposed ban account for a small fraction of murders in the United States.However Pollack said the ban proposed by Obama can help reduce gun violence especially what he called the psychologically impactful mass shootings such as the Newtown attack in which a lone gunman used a Bushmaster semi-automatic rifle.The combination of such weapons with high-capacity magazines “facilitates mass homicides” Pollack told CNN noting that professional criminals generally don’t use such rifles that look like military weapons.“The people who do use these weapons are often the most dangerous or most sociopathic” Pollack said. The Newtown shooter a 20-year-old man living with his mother took her legally owned guns and killed her before going to the school to open fire on students and teachers.New player in gun control ad warsTo Pollack such a mass killing – while relatively rare – “traumatizes communities and the entire society in a way that demands attention.”Studies show that street crime such as shooting deaths cost communities more than lives Pollack said citing emergency medical services and criminal investigation as tangible costs along with intangibles such as residents moving away to escape the threat.Obama also made that point in his remarks on Friday saying “it’s very hard to develop economically if people don’t feel safe.”In the aftermath of the Newtown shootings the NRA called for putting armed guards at every school rather than seeking to limit the ability of people to obtain weapons. It also wants tougher enforcement of existing gun laws which Pollack agreed was necessary.“A lot of the underground gun market could be stopped if we treated guns with the same amount of determination and tools as the drug market” he said.For example Pollack noted how committing a crime with a gun brought additional charges and he called for similar treatment for illegally possessing a firearm.How we talk about guns in my Chicago classroomIn a Google Hangout online chat on Thursday a participant asked Obama how renewing the assault weapons ban would help reduce gun violence caused primarily by handguns.He responded that his proposed package would affect handgun violence through the expanded background checks and cracking down on straw purchases. Renewing the weapons ban focused on what Obama called “weapons of war.”“It’s not going to solve every problem” the president continued noting that some restrictions are already in place.“We can’t purchase a grenade launcher from a store although there may be some folks who want to buy those” he said. “And the reason is we think on balance the Second Amendment does not automatically assume that any weapon that’s available you can automatically purchase.”NRA: Obama’s State of the Union shows true colors on gun violenceCNN’s Ashley Killough Paul Steinhauser and Halimah Abdullah contributed to this report.\",\n",
       " 'Gun stocks rose Wednesday even as President Obama called on Congress to pass an assault weapon ban.The stock prices for Smith & Wesson Holding Co. (SWHC) and Sturm Ruger & Co. (RGR) rose about 4%. The stock for Sturm Ruger has risen 13% in the month since the shooting at a Newtown Conn. elementary school that left 20 children and six educators dead.Retailers that specialize in guns have also done well. The stock price for Cabela\\'s (CAB) surged 6% on Wednesday and has gained 20% over the last month. Dick\\'s Sporting Goods (DKS) notched up slightly and has gained 6% over the month.Obama issued the call for the assault ban as part of a broad response to the Newtown shooting.\"Congress should restore the ban on military style assault weapons and a 10-round limit for magazines\" the president said. Obama was referring to a 10-year ban that expired in 2004 which limited the capacity of magazines and restricted military-style features on semiautomatic rifles.Related: Obama seeks assault weapons banBut the specter of a potential ban in the wake of mass shootings around the country has prompted gun enthusiasts to stock up on the weapons that may some day be denied to them.\"Consumers are flocking to stores to purchase certain types of firearms including assault rifles in fears of some type of ban going forward\" said Rommel Dionisio gun industry analyst for Wedbush Securities. \"It\\'s people rushing to buy them before they\\'re banned.\"Dick\\'s said last month that it has suspended sales of assault rifles.Related: Assault rifles are selling outSmith & Wesson and Sturm Ruger manufacture a wide variety of firearms including the semiautomatic rifles that are known various as assault weapons or modern sporting rifles.There are many other non-public companies that manufacture semiautomatic rifles including Bushmaster Firearms International which makes the rifle used at the Newtown shooting and also a recent shooting in Webster N.Y. where a convict burned down houses and then ambushed and killed two volunteer firefighters.Such a ban if it passes would also impact manufacturers of high-capacity magazines. They include the Beta Company which makes 100-round drums and SGM Tactical which produces 30-round and 100-round magazines.Related: A month after Newtown a massive gun trade showHigh-capacity magazines face a potential ban because they were used by Adam Lanza in the Newtown shooting and by James Holmes suspect in a mass shooting last year at a movie theater in Aurora Colo.Obama acknowledged that he faces serious opposition in trying to get an assault weapon bill passed by a Republican-controlled House.Even as Obama spoke thousands of gun industry members packed into the SHOT Show -- an annual trade show -- in Las Vegas. The show is owned and sponsored by the National Shooting Sports Foundation an organization based in Newtown less than two miles from the site of the Sandy Hook school shooting.',\n",

       " 'Former Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer has pledged his support for single-payer health care in the past but his recent efforts to bring zero-cost sharing primary and preventive care to Montana government employees and retirees may be doing something that most progressives would only dream could happen in America: bringing NHS-style socialized medicine to Montana.This is a big deal and -- while currently limited to state employees and retirees -- could be laying the groundwork for America\\'s most socially-just health care system. NPR has the details:A year ago Montana opened the nation\\'s first clinic for free primary healthcare services to its state government employees. The Helena Mont. clinic was pitched as a way to improve overall employee health but the idea has faced its fair share of political opposition. A year later the state says the clinic is already saving money. Pamela Weitz a 61-year-old state library technician was skeptical about the place at first. \"I thought it was just the goofiest idea but you know it\\'s really good\" she says. In the last year she\\'s been there for checkups blood tests and flu shots. She doesn\\'t have to go; she still has her normal health insurance provided by the state. But at the clinic she has no co-pays no deductibles. It\\'s free. That\\'s the case for the Helena area\\'s 11000 state workers and their dependents. With an appointment patients wait just a couple minutes to see a doctor. Visitation is more than 75 percent higher than initial estimates.The state contracts with a private company to run the facility and pays for everything — wages of the staff total costs of all the visits. Those are all new expenses and they all come from the budget for state employee healthcare. Even so division manager Russ Hill says it\\'s actually costing the state $1500000 less for healthcare than before the clinic opened. \"Because there\\'s no markup our cost per visit is lower than in a private fee-for-service environment\" Hill says. Physicians are paid by the hour not by the number of procedures they prescribe like many in the private sector. The state is able to buy supplies at lower prices. Bottom line: a patient\\'s visit to the employee health clinic costs the state about half what it would cost if that patient went to a private doctor. And because it\\'s free to patients hundreds of people have come in who had not seen a doctor for at least two years.Hill says the facility is catching a lot including 600 people who have diabetes 1300 people with high cholesterol 1600 people with high blood pressure and 2600 patients diagnosed as obese. Treating these conditions early could avoid heart attacks amputations or other expensive hospital visits down the line saving the state more money. Clinic operations director and physician\\'s assistant Jimmie Barnwell says this model feels more rewarding to him. \"Having those barriers of time and money taken out of the way are a big part [of what gets] people to come into the clinic. But then when they come into the clinic they get a lot of face time with the nurses and the doctors\" Barnwell says.Yup nobody is forced to visit this publicly-financed clinic run by a private operator. If they wish they can take their big-profit private health insurance and head to any doctor they want but folks are recognizing that this err... public option provides better care. And when patients do make this choice both the state and patients save money.Take a second and let the words above sink in real deep. There you have exactly why the UK Canada Australia Italy Costa Rica Cuba and other first-world -- and third-world -- countries are able to secure better health care outcomes than the United States with dramatically lower health care spending. Imagine what -- let\\'s call it the Montana model -- could do for our national debt . And you know even more importantly the health of our people and the wellbeing of our medical professionals.Again common sense that\\'s not too common in these United States -- with the exception of Montana -- at the moment. High-deductible garbage plans -- promoted by big wigs at Aetna and Cigna who want patients to have more \\'skin in the game\\' -- lead patients to delay putting off that chest pain until it becomes a heart attack...and open-heart surgery. When doctors aren\\'t dealing with private health insurer bureaucracy and any sort of medical billing the entire resources of the practice go towards taking care of human beings. When doctors are salaried instead of operating with a fee-for-service model they emphasize quality over quantity. This is how medicine works in the UK Canada and many other countries where protecting the wealth of hospital and insurance company CEOs is not the primary goal of the health care system.Even Republicans -- who you know are naturally predisposed to hate the idea of patients seeing doctors without cost-sharing -- have a tough time faulting the new clinics.\"For goodness sakes of course the employees and the retirees like it it\\'s free\" says Republican State Sen. Dave Lewis. ... Now Lewis is a retired state employee himself. He says personally he does like going there too. \"They\\'re wonderful people they do a great job but as a legislator I wonder how in the heck we can pay for it very long\" Lewis says.Well Mr. Republican they\\'re saving the state millions -- you just won\\'t admit it but at least you admit you love the socialized medicine.What\\'s most exciting about these clinics? More are on the way.Montana recently opened a second state employee health clinic in Billings the state\\'s largest city. Others are in the works.And best of all? Schweitzer went right around the backs of Republicans to set up these life- and money-saving clinics. That\\'s bold progressive leadership. Let\\'s do our best to spread the news far and wide about how the \"Montana model\" is proving what much of the rest of the world already knows: the ideal primary health care system should be free at point of use.',\n",
       " 'Ask most people on Capitol Hill and they’ll say: 50-50. Those are the odds they give for a government shutdown.An alternative to the shutdown would be a proposed delay of the individual mandate the most painful part of Obamacare which may seem like a Republican victory but on closer inspection would be a win for President Obama and Democrats.Historians — or commentators in the meantime — might view either of these possible outcomes as yet another “Putinesca” victory for the president: Saved by the enemy.Just as Russian President Vladimir Putin emerged at the brink of the U.S. bombing of Syria to orchestrate an alternative solution Republicans may have provided a rip cord for Obama.Postponement of the individual mandate is part of the GOP bargaining package on raising the debt ceiling. Delay it for a year say Republican leaders and they’ll raise the debt limit for a year to keep the government operating.1 of 25 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × The Right’s 25 most influential from Townhall.com View Photos The conservative Web site’s latest listing of the most prominent voices on the right with a few names you may not know.

Micah Walter/Reuters Wait 1 second to continue.At least one Democrat Joe Manchin has conceded that this would be a pretty good idea since the health-care overhaul obviously isn’t ready. The many flaws have been fully vetted for months though new ones continue to reveal themselves as we approach the insurance-exchange shopping spree scheduled to begin in a few days.Latest to the fraying Affordable (now “Adorable”) Care Act is a technological glitch in online applications for small businesses. It isn’t ready yet and will be delayed.What is ready and adorable is a sampler of new ads aimed at children who are still fretful about the new plan. Oh wait no. The ads featuring baby ducks and kittens — purring and feeling ducky about Obamacare — are aimed at adults. They’re certifiably cute but one can’t escape the thought that the federal government has skipped all pretense at treating Americans as adults. Naptime anyone?To be fair Sen. Ted Cruz read Dr. Seuss’s “Green Eggs and Ham” to his children during his 21-hour un-filibuster. The muse whispers: “Ted Cruz would send Ronald Reagan back to the Democratic Party.”Here’s the problem for Republicans which will not be news to those with a view of the long game. The short game is to stall Obamacare but to what end ultimately? Until Republicans can seize the Senate in 2014 and the White House in 2016 at which point they can repeal the whole thing?Skinny chance that.More likely whether the government shuts down or should Tinker Bell suddenly materialize and persuade Obama to cave and postpone his personal dream act Republicans will be viewed by a greater majority than previously as having no talent for leadership.1 of 76 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Congress View Photos A collection of cartoons about Capitol Hill.

No surprise there.Now consider the alternative scenario: Suppose Republicans succeed in getting the individual mandate delayed for a year — right up to the 2014 midterm elections. Bravo right? Not necessarily. If voters don’t have to experience the uncertainty and discomfort of being forced to buy insurance in an unwieldy dysfunctional system — all the while noticing that millions are still without coverage — who benefits?Surely not the Republicans who on the one hand can be blamed for depriving insurance coverage to those poor sick kittens and ducklings. On the other they accrue no benefit from having prevented the pain of implementing Obamacare.Republicans lose either way but they may lose biggest if they win.Alternatives to present circumstances do not abound. Republicans have drawn their line in the sand. Democrats have drawn theirs. Obama says no negotiating over the debt ceiling period.There is one alternative that is both perhaps best for the country and hardest for Obama. He could relent not to Republicans but to the greater good. He could delay full implementation past the 2014 elections which would accomplish two things: One he could iron out the wrinkles that are now apparent. Two Democrats would get to slide through another election cycle without the most visibly painful part of Obamacare — the individual mandate.What really does Obama have to lose? Only face the pain of which passes. What he would gain is the legacy that escapes so many these days — proof that he is a leader who does the right thing even if it hurts his pride just a little.Republicans who will have banished themselves to wander a while longer in the desert may have drawn a line too far.Read more from Kathleen Parker’s archive follow her on Twitter or find her on Facebook.',\n",
       " 'It’s possible that President Obama felt better after that confessional hour-plus press conference Thursday.He had come to publicly flog himself for the disastrous Obamacare website rollout comparing his role to that of a hapless football team captain: “If I fumble the ball you know I’m going to wait until I get the next play and then I’m going to try to run as hard as I can and do right by the team. So you know ultimately I’m the head of this team. We did fumble the ball on it.”He had also come to announce a temporary fix aimed at easing the outrage of many Americans who bought into his demonstrably untrue promise that “if you like your insurance policy you can keep it.”But it’s hard to imagine that anyone besides his Republican antagonists was comforted by the mea culpa or the newfound sense of transparency. Disappointed citizens angry insurance companies or freaked out Democratic legislators worried about their 2014 prospects probably didn’t feel a whole lot better after the president’s litany of disappointments.AdvertisementIn the course of an hour he admitted he didn’t know what was going on with the website and that partly may have been due to the “insularity” of the White House. He acknowledged he misled people by promising them they could keep their plans that it’s not easy to purchase a complicated product like health insurance online that the federal government is ill-equipped to develop technology systems.Here are seven issues Obama addressed taken from a transcript posted by the Washington Post:1. On why he allowed the Healthcare.gov website to be launched when it was failing internal tests:“OK. On the website I was not informed directly that the website would not be working the way it was supposed to. Had I been informed I wouldn’t be going out saying boy this is going to be great. You know I’m accused of a lot of things but I don’t think I’m stupid enough to go around saying this is going to be like shopping on Amazon or Travelocity a week before the website opens if I thought that it wasn’t going to work.Advertisement“So clearly we and I did not have enough awareness about the problems in the website. Even a week into it the thinking was that these were some glitches that would be fixed with patches as opposed to some broader systemic problems that took much longer to fix and we’re still working on them.“So you know that doesn’t excuse the fact that they just don’t work but I think it’s fair to say no...we would not have rolled out something knowing very well that it wasn’t going to work the way it was supposed to given all the scrutiny that we knew was going to be on the website.”2. On why he told people they could keep their insurance if they liked it:“With respect to the pledge I made that if you like your plan you can keep it I think you know and I’ve said in interviews that there is no doubt that the way I put that forward unequivocally ended up not being accurate. It was not because of my intention not to deliver on that commitment and that promise. We put a grandfather clause into the law but it was insufficient.Advertisement3. On what he’s going to do to fix that:“The other problem that has received a lot of attention concerns Americans who’ve received letters from their insurers that they may be losing the plans they bought in the old individual market often because they no longer meet the law’s requirements to cover basic benefits like prescription drugs or doctor’s visits....“I completely get how upsetting this can be for a lot of Americans particularly after assurances they heard from me that if they had a plan that they liked they could keep it. And to those Americans I hear you loud and clear. I said that I would do everything we can to fix this problem. And today I’m offering an idea that will help do it.“Already people who have plans that pre-date the Affordable Care Act can keep those plans if they haven’t changed. That was already in the law. That’s what’s called a grandfather clause that was included in the law. Today we’re going to extend that principle both to people whose plans have changed since the law took effect and to people who bought plans since the law took effect....The bottom line is insurers can extend current plans that would otherwise be canceled into 2014. And Americans whose plans have been canceled can choose to re-enroll in the same kind of plan.”Advertisement4. On why the federal government is so bad at technology systems:“There aren’t a lot of websites out there that have to help people compare their possible insurance options verify income to find out what kind of tax credits they might get communicate with those insurance companies so that they can purchase make sure that all of it’s verified right? So there’s just a bunch of pieces to it that made it challenging.“And you combine that with the fact that the federal government does a lot of things really well. One of the things it does not do well is information technology procurement. You know this is kind of a systematic problem that we have across the board....“As I said before our IT systems how we purchase technology in the federal government is cumbersome complicated and outdated....On my campaign I could simply say who are the best folks out there let’s get them around a table let’s figure out what we’re doing and we’re just going to continue to improve it and refine it and work on our goals.Advertisement“If you’re doing it at the federal government level you know you’re going through you know 40 pages of specs and this and that and the other and there’s all kinds of law involved. And it makes it more difficult. It’s part of the reason why chronically federal IT programs are over budget behind schedule.”5. On underestimating the difficulty of purchasing a complicated product like insurance online:“What we’re also discovering is that insurance is complicated to buy. And another mistake that we made I think was underestimating the difficulties of people purchasing insurance online and shopping for a lot of options with a lot of costs and lot of different benefits and plans and -- and somehow expecting that that would be very smooth and then they’ve also got to try to apply for tax credits on the website.“What we’re doing even as we’re trying to solve the technical problems is also what can we do to make the application a little bit simpler? What can we do to make it in English as opposed to bureaucrat-ese? Are there steps that we can skip while still getting the core information that people need?Advertisement“And part of what we’re realizing is that there are going to be a certain portion of people who are just going to need more help and more hand-holding in the application process....“And you know buying health insurance is never going to be like buying a song on iTunes. You know it’s just a much more complicated transaction.”6. On whether the website problems will be fixed by the end of the month as promised:”...On Dec. 1st Nov. 30th it will be a lot better but there will still be some problems. Some of those will not be because of technological problems although I’m sure that there will still be some glitches that have to be smoothed out.”Advertisement7. And finally--in my view a bit disingenuously--on why he can’t catch a break:“Part of this job is the things that go right you guys aren’t going to write about. The things that go wrong get prominent attention; that’s how it’s always been. That’s not unique to me as president and I’m up to the challenge. We’re going to get this done all right?”ALSO:More from Robin AbcarianAdvertisementPrincess Cruises says ship passenger intentionally jumped into oceanCalifornia assemblyman’s father killed in L.A. home; witnesses soughtTwitter: @robinabcarianrobin.abcarian@latimes.com',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON — The Senate is expected to reject decisively a House bill that would delay the full effect of President Obama’s health care law as a condition for keeping the government running past Monday as Senator Harry Reid the Democratic majority leader expressed confidence that he had public opinion on his side.Angering Republicans who lead the House Mr. Reid kept the Senate shuttered on Sunday in a calculated move to stall action on the House measure until Monday afternoon just hours before the government’s spending authority runs out at midnight.Without a complete capitulation by House Republicans large sections of the government would close hundreds of thousands of workers would be furloughed without pay and millions more would be asked to work for no pay.Polls show that the public is already deeply unhappy with its leaders in Congress and the prospect of the first government shutdown in 17 years would be the latest dispiriting development. With a temporary shutdown appearing inevitable without a last-ditch compromise the battle on Sunday became as much about blaming the other side as searching for a solution.',\n",
       " 'Krugman reminds us of the three simple ideas upon which the Affordable Care Act is based:1. All Americans even those with pre-existing conditions should have access to affordable health insurance2. All Americans even those currently healthy should be required (or induced) to buy insurance to spread the risks as broadly as possible to keep the costs reasonable3. There should be subsidiess to prevent the \"mandate\" from becoming too onerous so that the cost of premiums as a share of income can be held down.As to whether this approach can work despite the Republican predictions that it will fail we of course have the example of Romneycare in Massachusetts (based I remind people largely on a proposal from the Right-leaning Heritage Foundation). Krugman then explores whether larger starters with significant numbers of uninsured can duplicate what happened in the Bay State.The answer to this question depends in the first place on whether insurance companies are willing to offer coverage at reasonable rates. And the answer so far is a clear “yes.” In California insurers came in with bids running significantly below expectations; in New York it appears that premiums will be cut roughly in half.apologies but the latter link counts against your monthly quota from the NYTimes so you might not be able to see it.Krugman offers two paragraphs that frame the issue succinctly. In the first he writesOver all then health reform will help millions of Americans who were previously either too sick or too poor to get the coverage they needed and also offer a great deal of reassurance to millions more who currently have insurance but fear losing it; it will provide these benefits at the expense of a much smaller number of other Americans mostly the very well off. It is if you like a plan to comfort the afflicted while (slightly) afflicting the comfortable.So far the American people do not yet fully grasp that the vast majority of them will be better off with respect to medical insurance without being hit directly financially by the cost of premiums. A small number of better off Americans will wind up paying somewhat more. If the American people understand this attempting to sabotage Obamacare will have serious political implications for Republicans.There is also another problem for the GOP:And the prospect that such a plan might succeed is anathema to a party whose whole philosophy is built around doing just the opposite of taking from the “takers” and giving to the “job creators” known to the rest of us as the “rich.” Hence the brinkmanship.Krugman is very blunt about that philosophy but then we can remember a certain presidential candidate who complained about he 47% who are takers.brinkmanship - the willingness of the Republicans particularly among their tea party caucus members in the House to risk shutting down the government and crashing the economy in order to prevent the success of Obamacarewhen their own leaders have admitted that confrontations over the budget inflict substantial harm on the economy.It will not be because of fear of what is now a rapidly falling budget deficit.Nor Krugman opines will it be because they true believe that the slashing of federal spending will actually lead to increased prosperity.No Republicans may be willing to risk economic and financial crisis solely in order to deny essential health care and financial security to millions of their fellow Americans. Let’s hear it for their noble cause!Let me if I may explain just a bit what that noble cause is paraphrasing well-known words of the first (and greatest) Republican President:Government of the wealthy by the Republicans for the corporationsAnything that might threaten that paradigm is to be fought fiercely- that includes suppressing the votes of those who might vote for a different paradigm- that means fomenting fear and hatred on issues like guns in order to gin up an angry mob to vote against their own economic interests- that includes gerrymandering to minimize the impact of votes of the masses of people who either do not agree with their paradigm or who may not be able to be misled by the promotion of fear and hatredIt is the mentality of the American Colonel who said in Vietnam that in order to save the village we had to destroy it.It is the petulance of the child who if he can\\'t have his way wants to take the ball and go home even if someone else brought the ball.If you wonder why the House Republicans have now voted almost 40 times to try to kill Obamacare it is because if it succeeds not only will they not be able to roll it back but it also undercuts any arguments about the other social programs that for half a century or more they have tried to kill - Medicare Medicaid and most of all Social Security.Panic is the right words to describe Republican actions towards Obamacare.Petulance is another appropriate description.Which is why the White House and the Democrats have to hold firm- for the health (physical and economic) of the American people- for the future (economic and political) of the United States.',\n",
       " 'For a brief piece of background I am a family practice physician in a multi-specialty group of about 60 doctors mostly primary care.I think most people would agree that the American healthcare system has a lot of flaws. One of the biggest flaws is our fee-for-service system in general. It doesn\\'t make any sense but I get paid the same to see someone for an ear infection as I do to see someone with high blood pressure high cholesterol and diabetes. Someone comes for an appointment and based on the level of detail I obtain in the history the level of detail needed in physical examination and the complexity of medical decision-making that determines the fee for the visit. So as you can imagine an ear infection or sore throat requires a LOT less work than managing three or more chronic problems and the medications labs monitoring tests etc. that go along with them. But again you are paid the same to see the ear infection patient as you are to see the person with uncontrolled diabetes high BP and high cholesterol.On the surface that makes no sense at all but the thinking is that it probably costs too much for the ear infection too little for the diabetes/BP/cholesterol patient but it all evens out in the long run. The rules for \\'coding\\' a level of service for an appointment govern the fees and they are relatively simple as otherwise it would just be too complicated to have a different fee structure for every diagnosis. Anyway the idea is that it all comes out in the wash. That might be true in a simple world but of course we live in a complex world with a lot of moving parts.As you can see the fee-for-service environment does not really incentivize physicians to focus their efforts on chronic disease management. I\\'m not implying that physicians are not trying to do a good job or are just in it to make as much money as possible but let\\'s face it: if you make the same amount per patient and you can see 30 patients with ear infections or 15 diabetic/hypertensive/hyperlipidemic patients which would you choose? How would you set up your schedule?Everyone agrees that prevention is the most cost-effective way to keep people healthy. Vaccines for example are arguably the single most cost-effective thing in all of medicine (get your flu vaccine if you have not already done so by the way!). Preventative care is now covered without a co-pay because of the ACA. That is awesome. However better care/control of chronic disease doesn\\'t pay well as discussed above. But better control of diabetes of BP of cholesterol of COPD of asthma of heart failure will save lots and lots and lots of money in the long run because complications of all these diseases are expensive. It costs a LOT to be in the hospital to have a heart bypass to have dialysis etc. A rough estimate is that a well-controlled diabetic costs the system an average of $4000 per year to take care of but an uncontrolled diabetic will cost $16000 or more. So why would we pay doctors the same for an ear infection as we would to take care of serious chronic disease?Part of the answer unfortunately is that people switch insurances and by the time they develop more significant complications they are on Medicare anyway so UHC Humana Anthem don\\'t need to worry about paying for dialysis. In the long run though it saves us all money if we do a better job of taking care of chronic illness. So it makes sense to try to incentivize doctors to improve our chronic disease management instead of incentivizing doctors to just see as many patients as possible in the day.So enough background. Here\\'s the good stuff. The ACA provides funding and guidance for a new way to approach health care. The Comprehensive Primary Care initiative is a program that involves about 500 practices across the country in several geographic areas. Southwest Ohio/N. KY New Jersey Arkansas Colorado New York Oregon and Oklahoma have participating practices. Practices were selected based on a number of factors including past willingness to participate in such things as NCQA quality recognition and patient-centered medical home (PCMH) certification. You can read more here: http://innovation.cms.gov/...Basically CMS (center for Medicare and Medicaid services) provides funding outside of the fee-for-service environment for practices to do a better job of chronic disease management. There is/was a detailed application process and multiple milestones you have to meet but a lot of it boils down to CMS providing additional monies for practices to use as they see fit in order to help improve the care for their patients particularly (although not exclusively) those with higher risk chronic illness.The whole thing is actually really interesting. While there are quite a lot of specifics there are also a lot of areas open to interpretation. CMS is partnering with multiple private insurance carriers to provide a monthly fee (outside of any appointment or fee-for-service interaction) to physician practices in order to help those practices invest in infrastructure which will help improve patient care. The amount per patient per month is based on risk assessment. Basically the more diagnoses and the more complicated a patient is the higher the monthly fee. A well-controlled diabetic would have a lower fee than a diabetic with chronic kidney disease heart disease and neuropathy. So right off the bat you can see how this is a paradigm shift from the traditional fee-for-service environment. You may actually be paid more to take care of a more complicated person and try to keep them out of the hospital.However and this is a BIG part the money from this CPC initiative can NOT be paid to physicians as compensation. It is to be used to improve infrastructure. This is actually pretty cool because instead of just paying doctors more and saying \"hey if we pay you more you\\'ll do a better job right?\" CMS is saying \"we will give you money to use as you see fit (within the structure of our program and its milestones) to improve patient care which should improve outcomes decrease severe complication rates improve patient satisfaction and eventually decrease overall costs through an investment up front.\"If you hadn\\'t already guessed my group has several practices involved in the CPCI program and we are excited about it. I don\\'t know what the other 490-some practices across the country are doing but we have used the money to hire more staff including what we call Care Coordinators for each office an RN who can reach out to patients before during and after appointments to see how we can better coordinate care. We try to have labs drawn before folks come for appointments so we can have already reviewed the results before walking in the room. This allows for more efficient care. If someone\\'s cholesterol is not to goal for example we can increase the dose of their cholesterol medication while sitting with them and explaining why an LDL goal of under 70 is the target. This works a lot better than a medical assistant calling someone and playing phone tag three days after their appointment to try to make sure they know that the new dose is 40 mg instead of 20. Anyway the Care Coordinator can help reach out to people who might need help paying for meds and see what assistance programs might help someone. She can help someone who was recently in the hospital understand their new medication regimen and help set up their follow up. If someone doesn\\'t go for the colonoscopy or mammogram that we ordered she can call them and find out why and/or encourage them to go (and maybe mention that preventative care is covered 100% now!). She can review their chart ahead of time and put in a reminder for the doctor that the patient is due for a pneumonia vaccine or a shingles vaccine. This is all part of the team-based approach to care which is helping to improve patient outcomes. Our practice would not really been able to afford a Care Coordinator without the CPCI monies. Our group has also decided to hire a diabetes educator. Insurance is often squirrelly about paying for diabetes education despite study after study clearly showing the benefits. Now we will be able to offer diabetes eduction free of charge to all of our patients. This is pretty great all around. The doctors get more help the patients get more individualized attention and care outcomes improve which specifically means someone didn\\'t have a stroke. Someone didn\\'t lose their vision because of diabetes. Someone had a precancerous colon polyp removed instead of being diagnosed with metastatic cancer a couple years later. Someone\\'s grandmother didn\\'t lose her foot. Oh and all that stuff also saves money.That\\'s the other piece of the CPCI which is a multi-year venture: \"shared savings.\" You can calculate how much a population of patients is likely to cost over say three years based on how sick they are. If people get their blood pressure cholesterol blood sugar asthma under better control they will cost less to take care of because they will have fewer ER visits fewer hospitalizations fewer procedures. Sure they might take more medications get more frequent lab tests maybe more frequent (outpatient) doctor appointments but this leads to an overall reduction of the cost of care. So for the additional work to do a better job of taking care of patients practices in each region get a chance to share in the $$ saved by providing more efficient care. This will be calculated and distributed equally among the 75 or so practices in each region.There\\'s of course a lot more to the story but this diary is already rather lengthy. I\\'m excited about the program though. It really is a win-win. It has a lot of the things that us progressives like: government-initiated innovation. Science-based (or to use the medical buzzword evidence-based) care. Regulations on how the money can be used with the greater good in mind. Short term investment for long term success (I didn\\'t mention that the money is eventually phased out with the hope that the infrastructure improvements will lead to overall better reimbursements and a focus on \"pay-for-performance\" or better pay for better quality care). Using government dollars to help those who need it most (ie sicker patients). Shared benefits in the long run for all of us. If we are all healthier we cost less to the healthcare system. We are more productive workers. We have fewer people on disability. We end up putting more $$ back into the economy and indirectly increase government revenue (if you can work more and make more money because you are healthier you end up paying more taxes and of course can purchase more goods and services).Anyway it\\'s a relatively small part of the ACA and unless you go to a practice involved in the CPCI you likely would never hear about it. But in the long run the idea is that the extra $$ will help to transform how we provide care therefore leading to a sea change in primary care across the country. If you get better outcomes improve patient satisfaction AND save money while practicing a certain way every practice is going to want to adopt these methods. Over the next few years the 500 practices will be sharing (HIPAA-compliant) data successes and failures to try to come up with \"best practices\" we can all use to keep people healthier longer. Because everyone benefits from that and that is really what the Affordable Care Act is about.',\n",
       " \"It's beginning to look as if the Republican effort to hold the rest of the government hostage for the sacking of the Affordable Care Act just might backfire big time. For starters the effort has elicited something long missing on the part of this president -- some spine.Ever since he stepped into the Rose Garden on October 1 to warn the Republicans that he simply wasn't prepared to negotiate while the government was shut down and default on the debt was threatened we've seen a much tougher Obama. The split in the Republicans meanwhile continues to widen with an ever-increasing backlash among party professionals against the nihilism of Ted Cruz and company. Poor John Boehner tacks back and forth between frantically trying to hold his coalition together and signaling that he'd be willing to suspend the Hastert Rule and allow pragmatic Republicans vote with Democrats to keep the government open.Public opinion seems to be moving against the Republicans. The question is no longer whether they will continue their suicidal gambit but when they will cave and on what terms.Weirdly by threatening to shut the government unless Obama killed the Affordable Care act they got the opposite of what they sought. The rest of the government is closed and Obamacare is open for business.And while Republicans and movement conservatives have spent the better part of a year demonizing Obama's health reform the more people become familiar with it the more people will appreciate it -- leaving the Republican alarmism with no clothes. In that regard the president and his strategists would do well to change one core piece of their rhetoric. In his Rose Garden remarks the president said this:Now of course if you're one of the 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance you don't need to do a thing. You're already benefiting from new benefits and protections that have been in place for some time under this law. But for the 15 percent of Americans who don't have health insurance this opportunity is life-changing.In fact that's profoundly wrong and weakens the president's case. The statistically accurate contention that 85 percent of people will have no change in their insurance is a throwback to the early days of the health reform debate when focus groups suggested that people who had employer-provided insurance and liked it needed to be reassured.But a lot has changed since then. Employer coverage is eroding. People who lose jobs or change jobs typically lose their insurance. COBRA protection paid entirely by the former worker is only a temporary and largely unaffordable stopgap.The fact is that the Affordable Care Act helps a lot more the 15 percent of the population. Young adults with no employer-provided insurance (and their parents) already know how valuable Obamacare is for allowing people under age 26 to stay on their parents' insurance. People without jobs and at risk of losing jobs are also coming to value the Affordable Care Act.There is an analogy here with the revolution in broad acceptance of sexual diversity. As more and more gays and lesbians came out straight people were initially shocked then surprisingly accepting as they realized that they had a friend co-worker neighbor or family member who turned out to be gay.As more and more people sign up for affordable insurance thanks to Obama Care many Americans who have insurance (and many who are worried about losing it) will hear heart-rending firsthand stories about friends colleagues and relatives with medical worries who finally get insurance. That coalition is a lot more than 15 percent.Many of these people incidentally are in red states where the percentage of the uninsured tends to be far higher than the national average. In several such states Republican governors have broken ranks and signed their states up for the provision of the Affordable Care Act that has the Federal government finance nearly all the costs of expanded Medicaid.No wonder the Republicans are so desperate to kill Obamacare in utero. The more it takes effect the more their hysteria will be proven to be a phony. By 2014 when the Republican House majority will present itself for re-election the Affordable Care Act could be quite popular. What then?President Obama increasingly finds himself in the chips.

       " 'WASHINGTON — House Republicans united Wednesday around a plan to use the threat of a government shutdown as leverage to repeal President Obama’s healthcare law confident the American people are on their side.House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) yielded to his right flank by agreeing to attach the healthcare law repeal to a must-pass bill to keep the government funded past Sept. 30. A vote is expected Friday on a bill that would allow the government to stay open for the next few months.AdvertisementThe measure is all but certain to pass the Republican-led House but faces rejection in the Senate where the Democratic majority has shown little interest in undoing Obama’s signature domestic achievement.Without a resolution by Oct. 1 the start of the new federal fiscal year the government will run out of money to keep federal workers on the job and provide basic services.AdvertisementBoehner and his leadership team had tried to avoid a prolonged battle over government funding but the speaker saw no other option after the most conservative House members revolted last week.“Every member in this room is for defunding Obamacare” Boehner told his colleagues in a private meeting in the Capitol basement according to a source in the room. “We’re going to send it over to the Senate so our conservative allies over there can continue the fight.”AdvertisementTop Republicans worry the party will be blamed if government services are interrupted much the way the party suffered during the last shutdowns in the mid-1990s. They were hoping to hold off the fight over repealing the healthcare law until next month when Obama may be forced to bargain in exchange for the administration’s request to raise the debt limit to borrow money to avoid defaulting on the nation’s bills.But many rank-and-file Republicans believe stopping the healthcare law is their constituents’ top priority.Advertisement“We’re doing what the American people are asking us to do” said third-term Rep. Marlin Stutzman (R-Ind.). “I think now is the time. You take the best opportunity that you have.”Rep. Tom Graves (R-Ga.) among those leading the fight said “I think over the next 12 days there’s going to be a strong argument from the American people saying this is the path forward.”AdvertisementPolls show more Americans oppose the law the Affordable Care Act than support it even as the online health insurance marketplaces are set to open Oct. 1. Obama on Wednesday asked the Business Roundtable an organization of top business leaders to use its influence to encourage lawmakers to “not promise apocalypse every three months.”“I think this is the time for us to say once and for all we can’t afford these kinds of plays” Obama said. “I know the American people are tired of it. I’m tired of it and I suspect you’re tired of it too.”AdvertisementA similar message was sent to Capitol Hill from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce which warned that it was “not in the best interest of the U.S. business community or the American people to risk even a brief government shutdown.”The fight to keep the government running is the first in series of choke points this fall that Republicans intend to use to pressure Obama since they have failed repeatedly to stop the healthcare law.AdvertisementBy mid-October Congress will be asked to raise the debt limit and Republican leaders are gearing up to demand a one-year delay of the healthcare law as part of any deal with the White House. The funding bill if approved would keep the government open through Dec. 15.How Congress will handle the Sept. 30 deadline for a government funding resolution remains an open question.AdvertisementSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) will probably ask Democrats to strip the healthcare law repeal from the resolution but Republicans in the Senate will be under enormous pressure to prevent that.Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) a potential presidential contender who has been a vocal opponent of the healthcare law and other conservative senators are being urged by their House colleagues to mount a round-the-clock filibuster if needed to thwart Democrats.AdvertisementThe senator however did not appear to promise heroics as he acknowledged Reid probably had enough votes. But Cruz’s spokesman said “all options remain on the table.”Intensifying the threat of a shutdown Boehner does not appear to have a backup plan if the Senate sends the funding bill back to the House without the healthcare law repeal.AdvertisementMany House Republicans appear unprepared for that scenario which could unfold late next week. Others such as Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.) insisted they would not vote for a bill that did not kill the healthcare law.“This is the line in the sand” he said.AdvertisementBoehner may need to rely on Democrats to help pass the bill which he has been increasingly reluctant to do because it could threaten his already shaky hold over his Republican majority.lisa.mascaro@latimes.comAdvertisementChristi Parsons in the Washington bureau contributed to this report.',\n",

       " 'By Tom Brown MIAMI (Reuters) - Florida\\'s leading health insurer is reaching out to hundreds of thousands of state residents touting temporary relief from what it describes as an imminent spike in premium rates due to President Barack Obama\\'s signature healthcare reform law. \"When the new healthcare law takes effect you may be surprised how much more you could pay for health insurance\" says an advisory to consumers from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida also known as Florida Blue. \"Find out how much you\\'ll save if you buy now\" adds the advisory which has been mailed over the past month to homes of existing policyholders and potential new clients. \"Let us help you get the best deal on health insurance right now\" the notice says. \"We can even tell you if you can get help paying for coverage from the government.\" Under Obama\\'s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act millions of uninsured Americans will be able to buy government-subsidized health coverage on new online state insurance exchanges beginning on October 1. The cost of the new plans which require insurers to provide more benefits to consumers and bar the exclusion of people with prior illnesses is a key factor to making the enrollment effort a success. However the law also allows consumers to select from existing individual insurance policies now and extend them into 2014. While these existing policies may be cheaper in some states than those under the Obamacare reform plan many may not contain the same comprehensive benefits. Florida Blue\\'s notice marks one of the more aggressive efforts by an insurer to tap into fears of \"sticker shock\" for the newer Obamacare plans. Republican-led Florida refused to set up its own insurance exchange leaving the job to the federal government. The enrollment stakes are big in the Sunshine State where the U.S. Census Bureau says there are about 3.8 million people without health insurance. About a quarter of Florida\\'s population is uninsured giving it the third-highest rate in the country. Florida\\'s insurance regulators have said the cost of new insurance plans may rise 30 to 40 percent when compared with a fictional 2013 plan modeled to include the same benefits. But rates in the state are still being finalized between insurers and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Florida estimates don\\'t include substantial subsidies that a majority of uninsured people may qualify for. Florida Blue said the advisory is part of a direct mail advertising campaign aimed at drumming up new business for the Jacksonville Florida-based giant which reported $8.9 billion in revenues last year and covers more than 4.3 million people in its primary health business in the state. The company a leading contributor to the political action committee of Florida\\'s Republican Governor Rick Scott is one of nine insurers that have applied to sell non-group policies on the state\\'s new marketplace and the only one that promises to cover every county in Florida. Craig Thomas the executive responsible for marketing and strategy at Florida Blue said the consumer advisory - unlike anything seen from other health insurance companies in Florida - was part of what he termed \"an appropriate marketing program.\" It primarily targets many people purchasing coverage in Florida\\'s individual market today who will be ineligible for premium subsidies under Obamacare Thomas said. Many of those same consumers will be hit with higher rates because of benefit changes and other factors tied to next year\\'s full implementation of the law he said. \"Their rates are generally going to go up\" said Thomas. \"New expenses are going to be reflected in next year\\'s premiums.\" HURTING ENROLLMENT Federal and consumer groups dispute the state\\'s projections. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told reporters on a recent Florida visit that competition for customers should help keep premiums in check. An HHS spokeswoman declined to comment on the Florida Blue campaign which comes against the backdrop of a full-court press by Scott and other Republican leaders in the state to undermine Obamacare. But Ron Pollack who heads Families USA the national healthcare consumer advocacy group strongly criticized the campaign and said it could hurt enrollment in Florida for coverage under the president\\'s reform plan. \"This letter from an insurer that has tried to appear helpful to consumers is outrageous misleading and for many totally erroneous\" Pollack told Reuters. \"People who get suckered into this appeal may very well lose many thousands of dollars in premium subsidies that become available soon if they enroll starting on October 1 in health coverage through the Affordable Care Act\" he said. Republican opponents of the reform law were the driving force behind Florida Senate Bill 1842. Signed into law by Governor Scott in May the legislation prohibits Florida\\'s Office of Insurance Regulation from providing any real protection for consumers from unreasonably high health insurance rates. The federal government says it lacks the legal authority to regulate insurance premiums in individual states though it is trying to persuade insurers to alter higher-priced plans when it can. Sebelius who has said she was \"baffled\" by Florida\\'s move commented earlier this month that she knew of no other state that had chosen to eliminate its own regulatory oversight leaving consumers at the mercy of health insurance companies. \"It\\'s really unconscionable that the Florida legislature and Governor Scott would take what is in essence the insurance cop regulating insurance companies off the playing field take that cop off the beat ... It just doesn\\'t make sense for families or small businesses. They\\'re supposed to be on our side\" said Tampa\\'s U.S. Representative Kathy Castor. Castor Debbie Wasserman Schultz and seven other Florida Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives sent a letter to Sebelius decrying their state\\'s deregulation of health insurers as \"a cynical and intentional effort by Governor Scott and the Florida legislature to undermine the Affordable Care Act and make health insurance premiums more expensive on the Florida Health Insurance Marketplace.\" The same law that curtails Florida\\'s rate-setting authority requires insurers to issue notices to consumers blaming hikes in premiums on \"the impact of federal healthcare reform.\" A copy of one such notice which all health insurance companies operating in the state will be required to use was made available to Reuters by the insurance commissioner\\'s office. Thomas who spoke in a telephone interview with Reuters from Jacksonville said many Florida consumers could benefit financially from buying policies now even though the plans would expire under Obamacare with no chance of renewal. \"The benefits and rates they buy now would not be changed until the product anniversary date gets here next summer\" Thomas said. It will carry them with their current program well into next year\" he added. He and other company officials declined to comment on how Florida Blue\\'s premiums in 2014 would compare to existing rates. (Editing by Ken Wills)',\n",
       " '‘Tis the season of giving charity and good will — unless you happen to be a Republican and then ‘tis the season of pusillanimity churlishness and bad will.Congressional Republicans seem hell-bent on denying the most disadvantaged among us healthcare unemployment benefits and perhaps worst of all food stamps from which the House of Representatives slashed $40 billion last month. Elizabeth Drew writing in Rolling Stone calls it “The Republicans’ War on the Poor.”You can attribute these benefit cuts to plain meanness with a dose of political calculation thrown in as Drew does. But there may be another explanation than congenital cruelty: Republicans believe they are adhering to a principle that they place above every other value including compassion. That principle is the need to punish individuals whom they view as undeserving.Though we Americans love to brag about our decency and concern for others the punitive gene runs deep in our national DNA. It goes back to the Puritans who while professing charitableness and community had a hard vision of life. They subscribed to the Protestant idea that since you couldn’t know if you were one of the “elect” predestined for salvation you had to look for signs. A major one is a productive life.The sociologist Max Weber fastened on this Protestant work ethic as the basis of Western civilization’s material success. As he saw it capitalism was a by-product of the desire for grace. For the Protestants hard work was not only a potential sign of personal salvation. It became a sign of national salvation.The United States was particularly fertile ground for this. It was not only a Protestant nation it took pride in being a classless society a meritocracy — in which the secular elect would become just as important as the religious. The country’s governing principle was and still is that anyone can make it here if he or she is just willing to put in the necessary elbow grease.This may be why no country seems to worship success as much as the United States. Our success is always perceived to be earned. This is American bedrock — our primary myth remains the social mobility of the Horatio Alger stories.But if the work ethic was secularized and popularized it was also politicized. If every individual was responsible for his or her own destiny — short of natural disasters which some conservatives see as divine punishment for various cultural transgressions — there was no need for government interventions to redress inequalities.In a world where everyone is on their own help is not just wasteful; it is ungodly and un-American. If we are responsible for our success we are also responsible for our failure.It is impossible to know whether the modern Republican Party exploited self-reliance to destroy big government or sought to destroy big government as a principle of self-reliance. Whichever this is now deeply embedded in modern conservatism.When U.S. conservatives cut unemployment benefits it is because giving the unemployed money allegedly discourages them from working. When they cut food stamps it is because they claim recipients are gaming the system though there is virtually no evidence to support this. Representative Jack Kingston (R-Ga.) a Senate candidate proposed last week that any child receiving lunches through the federal school lunch program be required to work to earn the food.But Republicans wouldn’t be proposing these hardships if there weren’t a sizable contingent of Americans supporting them. Presumably on the basis that the disadvantaged aren’t really disadvantaged. They are unworthy.Slashing benefits is only cruel if you are hurting the deserving. But in the conservatives’ view the poor are never deserving. So you can hack away with a sense of righteousness. Poverty they insist is a choice.This may help explain the conservatives’ anger at anyone who purports to help the poor. Doing so violates the sense of justice for many on the right. It isn’t just that conservatives hate government for taking taxpayers’ hard-earned dollars. They hate it because it rewards indolence — where politics conjoins with sinfulness.This has a powerful appeal. And it goes a long way toward answering the liberal quandary of why so many Americans who could benefit from government programs oppose them and work against their own self-interest.The answer goes back to those Puritan roots. We are a nation of scolds and scourges. We hate the idea that someone can get something he or she didn’t earn. So what’s the matter with Kansas may just be that many Americans believe in something more important than self-interest more important than compassion. Punishment.Many Americans certainly many Republicans are more interested in making sure that the “undeserving” are not being rewarded than making sure the deserving are rewarded.Sure it is punitive. Meting out punishment however is something we love to do. Which is why one of our major political parties can subsist on it. The Republican Party is the punishment party.All this is worth remembering at this time of year. We may say we like giving. But a whole lot of us resent the taking. Or put another way it is better to give so long as no one needs to receive.PHOTO: House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) (C) is flanked by House Majority Whip Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.)

In the past week reports of pending plan cancellations have become a political problem for President Barack Obama who promised years ago as he was pushing to pass the healthcare law that Americans who liked their health plans could keep them. While that remains true for most people with insurance a small percentage of the 17 million Americans with individual policies are now getting notice that they will terminate next year because they do not comply with new benefits required by Obamacare. Many insurers are offering new compliant policies to replace those that are expiring but they may be significantly more expensive. Nearly half of U.S. consumers with individual health plans are also expected to qualify for tax credits to buy insurance on new state exchanges under Obamacare. \"When you are that individual who has a benefit plan and it\\'s working for you and your family at your current life stage and you are told that you no longer have that choice that\\'s disruptive and that\\'s the environment that as a country we are going through right now\" Cigna Chief Executive David Cordani said in an interview. Cigna had about 232000 people in individual policies at the end of September according to company filings. Competitor WellPoint Inc which operates 14 Blue Cross Blue Shield licenses including the Anthem and Empire brands has about 1.8 million people in individual plans. Aetna Inc which bought smaller insurer Coventry earlier this year has 650000 members in these plans and will drop about 50000 members when it exits the California market at the end of this year. In defending the healthcare law on Wednesday Obama said it was not to blame for the plan cancellations and that the real fault lies with \"bad apple\" insurers who were allowed to sell cut-rate policies that offered minimal coverage for people when they needed them the most. Cordani declined to comment on Obama\\'s remarks but noted that individual plans have been subjected to numerous new requirements under the law. States determine the minimum eligible benefits and there are federal requirements so in some states elements such as the size of the deductible could disqualify an individual plan for 2014. \"It\\'s as simple as that\" he said. WellPoint and Aetna declined to comment on specifics about policy cancellations or about the president\\'s comments. Cordani said that Cigna has a small individual insurance business and is not significantly impacted by needing to cancel these plans. In addition it has about 125000 employer-sponsored plans that will end on January 1 2014 because they do not comply with the law. These plans typically targeted seasonal or hourly workers he said and it was clear from when the health reform law was passed in 2010 that they were going away.

       " 'Rep. Paul D. Ryan the former Republican vice presidential candidate has been a tea party favorite and a bridge between House conservatives and the party leadership ever since he took the lead in crafting a plan to scale back Medicare and other social programs to reduce federal spending.But on Wednesday when Ryan (R-Wis.) stepped forward to try to bring Republican factions together behind a strategy to end the government’s latest budget stalemate some of the same conservatives who once trusted him went cold.AdvertisementThe complaint: His plan which centered on trimming back spending on government entitlement programs failed to mention the demise of Obamacare as a top Republican objective. Conservatives accused him of abandoning their cause and caving in to Democrats.“So we are going to ditch the fight over Obamacare which is extremely unpopular to fight for Medicare reform? Really Paul Ryan? And they think we are politically stupid?” wrote Daniel Horowitz on RedState.com an influential conservative website.Advertisement“This is the road to cave city” he said.The heated reaction showed how deeply divided Republicans remain in the second week of the government shutdown — with a week to go before the nation could run out of money to pay its bills.AdvertisementHouse GOP leaders have been trying to shift the focus of their standoff with the White House and Senate Democrats away from Sen. Ted Cruz’s drive to stop the president’s health law to a broader plan to cut the budget. But partly as a result the majority led by House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) can no longer explain what exactly it is fighting for.“There are a lot of ideas right now on the table” said Rep. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.). But he said Republicans hadn’t yet coalesced around one approach.AdvertisementOne way out would be a short-term agreement to raise the $16.7-trillion debt ceiling for a few weeks while both sides work on a broader budget agreement. Republicans are increasingly floating this proposal but Democrats are wary that the GOP will demand concessions.Senate Democrats are expected to vote this weekend on a proposal to suspend the debt limit through 2014.AdvertisementRepublican divisions over what they want from the White House have weakened their hand and made the stalemate harder to resolve. The party’s struggles could be seen in a new Gallup poll that put the GOP’s favorable rating at 28% the lowest measure for either political party since Gallup started asking the question in 1992 — lower even than the GOP’s standing during the last government shutdowns in 1995 and 1996.Ryan defended his approach on conservative commentator Bill Bennett’s radio show. “I don’t know that within the next two weeks we have a viable strategy for actually repealing Obamacare every piece of it” he said.AdvertisementThe conservative Heritage Action which helped launch the strategy taken by tea party favorite Cruz (R-Texas) said any action short of a fight over the Affordable Care Act would be “detrimental.”“Fundamentally we are not supportive of anything that’s going to take the focus away from the current fight over Obamacare” said Heritage’s Dan Holler. “That’s where we think the fight needs to be — that’s where the fight is.”AdvertisementAt the same time top conservatives especially those tired of the Cruz-led campaign heaped praise on Ryan as the party’s expert on fiscal issues. “Excellent piece by @RepPaulRyan on a path forward” tweeted Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) once a leader among House conservatives.But two-term Rep. Mo Brooks a Republican from Alabama called Ryan’s brief presentation before the House GOP’s conservative caucus Wednesday “very generic” and walked away undecided on whether he would sign on.Advertisement“The devil’s in the details” Brooks said. “Delaying socialized medicine — that is one way to delay one’s insolvency.”As Boehner struggled to find a cohesive strategy the White House sought to amplify Obama’s willingness to negotiate with Congress once it passes bills to end the shutdown and avert a default. The president invited every Republican in the House to meet with him Thursday at the White House. He held a similar session with Democrats on Wednesday.AdvertisementBoehner however decided to limit the White House session to a few top House Republicans. One GOP leadership aide said that a broader meeting would be little more than a “photo op.”The decision “disappointed” Obama the White House spokesman said. “The president thought it was important to talk directly with the members who forced this economic crisis on the country about how the shutdown and a failure to pay the country’s bills could devastate the economy” said White House Press Secretary Jay Carney.AdvertisementObama has refused to engage in serious talks until Republicans agree to reopen the government and raise the debt limit. “The president will talk to anyone any time and looks forward to their visit to the White House but will not pay the Republicans ransom for doing their job” Carney said.Splinters among Democrats who have publicly maintained an unusually united front also emerged Wednesday as liberals warned against budget talks that could result in steep cuts to cherished government programs.AdvertisementRep. Raul M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.) co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus has called those fears “grand bargain paranoia.” Democrats worry based on past talks aimed at a so-called grand bargain that the president might be willing to reduce Social Security benefits or increase the amount of money higher-income seniors pay toward Medicare.But Democrats appeared unified Wednesday as senators rallied on the Capitol steps and House Democrats met with Obama. “The debt ceiling needs to be lifted. They’re not getting anything for that” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) as she left the White House with her leadership team.AdvertisementThe reemergence of Ryan whose role had faded since the January day when he led rebellious House Republicans back from the brink of an earlier fiscal standoff still holds the potential to shift the debate.Ryan’s prescriptions spelled out in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal reflect Boehner’s interest in a deal that could provide what the budget chairman has called a “big down payment” on the nation’s debt.AdvertisementRyan said Wednesday that he was “totally committed to dismantling” the healthcare law. “Obamacare is an entitlement just like any other entitlement. So that as far as we’re concerned is in this conversation” he said on Bennett’s radio show. “Ultimately we have to rethink all of our nation’s healthcare laws.”lisa.mascaro@latimes.comAdvertisementmichael.memoli@latimes.comChristi Parsons and Brian Bennett in the Washington bureau contributed to this report.',\n",
       " 'Leading Republicans appear to be nerving themselves up for another round of attempted fiscal blackmail. With the end of the fiscal year looming they aren’t offering the kinds of compromises that might produce a deal and avoid a government shutdown; instead they’re drafting extremist legislation — bills that would for example cut clean-water grants by 83 percent — that has no chance of becoming law. Furthermore they’re threatening once again to block any rise in the debt ceiling a move that would damage the U.S. economy and possibly provoke a world financial crisis.Yet even as Republican politicians seem ready to go on the offensive there’s a palpable sense of anxiety even despair among conservative pundits and analysts. Better-informed people on the right seem finally to be facing up to a horrible truth: Health care reform President Obama’s signature policy achievement is probably going to work.And the good news about Obamacare is I’d argue what’s driving the Republican Party’s intensified extremism. Successful health reform wouldn’t just be a victory for a president conservatives loathe it would be an object demonstration of the falseness of right-wing ideology. So Republicans are being driven into a last desperate effort to head this thing off at the pass.Some background: Although you’d never know it from all the fulminations with prominent Republicans routinely comparing Obamacare to slavery the Affordable Care Act is based on three simple ideas. First all Americans should have access to affordable insurance even if they have pre-existing medical problems. Second people should be induced or required to buy insurance even if they’re currently healthy so that the risk pool remains reasonably favorable. Third to prevent the insurance “mandate” from being too onerous there should be subsidies to hold premiums down as a share of income.',\n",
       " 'House Speaker John Boehner has many competing interests to satisfy as he tries to come up with a way to defund Obamacare increase defense spending cut domestic spending and make the sequester levels of funding permanent all without being responsible for shutting down the government. So far it doesn\\'t look like he\\'s succeeding. By the end of the day Tuesday Boehner will present a plan that attempts to fake out Senate Democrats and force any possibility of a shutdown into their court.The plan reportedly is to pass what they\\'re calling a \"clean\" continuing resolution bill for funding the government for the next three months that includes a separate House concurrent resolution to defund Obamacare. They would create a rule to govern debate on the bill that said the House wouldn\\'t send the funding part of the bill over to the Senate until that body voted on the Obamacare defunding part of the bill. The Senate would vote down the defunding measure so they could go onto the spending bill. That would allow Republicans to declare that Senate Democrats \"own\" Obamacare a threat that said Democrats can probably live with.The proposal has gone over like a lead balloon with the far right. Club for Growth president Chris Chocola calls the proposal a \"bad joke\" and said \"[t]rying to fool Republicans into voting to fund ObamaCare is even worse than offering a bill that deliberately funds it.\" Teabagger House members are also not mollified still demanding a continuing resolution that defunds Obamacare. Eighty of them signed a letter to Boehner to that effect and an aide told The Hill that they \"are still expected to vote against any continuing resolution that does not defund ObamaCare.\"But the Obamacare defunding might just be a sideshow for Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor who have their eye on another prize: maintaining the sequester level of federal spending for everything but defense. Cantor told his caucus that this would be their victory forcing the president to sign a continuing resolution that \"wipes away all the increases he and congressional Democrats made while they were in charge and returns us to a pre-2008 level of discretionary spending.” Salon\\'s Brian Beutler outlines this part of the plan Boehner and Cantor might decide to take.The new fiscal year starts on October 1. To adhere to the debt limit deal Congress would pass a CR appropriating $1.058 trillion — $552 billion for defense $506 billion for non defense. Then sequestration would automatically reduce that to an annualized rate of $967 billion. The advantage off writing the CR this way is that if at any point Congress manages to agree on a plan to replace sequestration discretionary spending will automatically increase to the levels agreed up on in 2011. But GOP leaders keep hinting at writing the CR to reflect a maximum appropriation of $988 billion — the same amount the government is spending under sequestration right now.The sequestration measure would then kick in to make the actual spending level $967 billion for the next year. The $21 billion difference between the appropriated $988 billion and the $967 billion limit would be plowed into defense spending while cash-starved domestic programs would continue to have to function on their sequester-reduced budgets. Cute trick for Boehner if he can pull it off. But Democrats are full aware of his plans and are demanding a truly \"clean\" continuing resolution with \"no funny business\" according to an aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.If this is the path Boehner decides on he also has to get it past his own Republicans because he won\\'t have any Democratic support. Given how devoted the extremists in his caucus are to really truly defunding Obamacare (or at least trying to) he might not get that far and he might have to shoulder responsibility for a shutdown fight anyway.',\n",
       " 'By Kay Henderson DES MOINES Iowa (Reuters) - Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin who rallied members of the Tea Party in their failed effort to defund Obamacare lashed out on Saturday against members of the Republican Party who agreed to end the government shutdown. The 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee\\'s comments during a speech in Des Moines come at a time of division within the party over the strategy conservative members of Congress adopted in forcing a 16-day shutdown of the federal government last month. Polls have shown voters blamed Republicans for the shutdown. Palin who was speaking to hundreds of attendees at the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition\\'s annual fall banquet was joined by Senator Mike Lee a Republican from Utah. Lee along with fellow Tea Party movement star Senator Ted Cruz was instrumental in the ill-fated attempt to defund Obamacare the popular name for the healthcare reform law championed by President Barack Obama. Palin told the Christian conservatives in attendance it was time to \"stiffen our spines\" for the 2014 elections. \"I want to encourage you to make your voice heard to hold politicians accountable\" Palin said. The bulk of Palin\\'s speech was focused on the nation\\'s current political climate. She drew thunderous applause with her sharp attack on Republicans in Congress who voted in October to raise the nation\\'s debt ceiling and reopen the government. \"They promised that they would do everything in their power to fight against socialized medicine against Obamacare but when it came time to stand and defund it they waved the white flag of surrender and they threw under the bus the good guys who did stand up and fight for us\" Palin said. Palin named Lee and Cruz as leaders in that fight. Last month Cruz also made a stop in Iowa a key state in presidential campaigns because the Iowa caucuses are the first electoral event in the nominating process. In 2010 Lee defeated three-term Republican Senator Bob Bennett in a primary on his way to winning the Senate seat. In his speech on Saturday he called on Republicans to offer up \"market-based alternatives\" that could replace Obamacare if the Republicans hope to have success at the polls in 2014. \"Frustration is not a platform. Anger is not an agenda and outrage as a habit is not even conservative\" Lee said. (Editing by Alex Dobuzinskis)',\n",
       " 'Krugman reminds us of the three simple ideas upon which the Affordable Care Act is based:1. All Americans even those with pre-existing conditions should have access to affordable health insurance2. All Americans even those currently healthy should be required (or induced) to buy insurance to spread the risks as broadly as possible to keep the costs reasonable3. There should be subsidiess to prevent the \"mandate\" from becoming too onerous so that the cost of premiums as a share of income can be held down.As to whether this approach can work despite the Republican predictions that it will fail we of course have the example of Romneycare in Massachusetts (based I remind people largely on a proposal from the Right-leaning Heritage Foundation). Krugman then explores whether larger starters with significant numbers of uninsured can duplicate what happened in the Bay State.The answer to this question depends in the first place on whether insurance companies are willing to offer coverage at reasonable rates. And the answer so far is a clear “yes.” In California insurers came in with bids running significantly below expectations; in New York it appears that premiums will be cut roughly in half.apologies but the latter link counts against your monthly quota from the NYTimes so you might not be able to see it.Krugman offers two paragraphs that frame the issue succinctly. In the first he writesOver all then health reform will help millions of Americans who were previously either too sick or too poor to get the coverage they needed and also offer a great deal of reassurance to millions more who currently have insurance but fear losing it; it will provide these benefits at the expense of a much smaller number of other Americans mostly the very well off. It is if you like a plan to comfort the afflicted while (slightly) afflicting the comfortable.So far the American people do not yet fully grasp that the vast majority of them will be better off with respect to medical insurance without being hit directly financially by the cost of premiums. A small number of better off Americans will wind up paying somewhat more. If the American people understand this attempting to sabotage Obamacare will have serious political implications for Republicans.There is also another problem for the GOP:And the prospect that such a plan might succeed is anathema to a party whose whole philosophy is built around doing just the opposite of taking from the “takers” and giving to the “job creators” known to the rest of us as the “rich.” Hence the brinkmanship.Krugman is very blunt about that philosophy but then we can remember a certain presidential candidate who complained about he 47% who are takers.brinkmanship - the willingness of the Republicans particularly among their tea party caucus members in the House to risk shutting down the government and crashing the economy in order to prevent the success of Obamacarewhen their own leaders have admitted that confrontations over the budget inflict substantial harm on the economy.It will not be because of fear of what is now a rapidly falling budget deficit.Nor Krugman opines will it be because they true believe that the slashing of federal spending will actually lead to increased prosperity.No Republicans may be willing to risk economic and financial crisis solely in order to deny essential health care and financial security to millions of their fellow Americans. Let’s hear it for their noble cause!Let me if I may explain just a bit what that noble cause is paraphrasing well-known words of the first (and greatest) Republican President:Government of the wealthy by the Republicans for the corporationsAnything that might threaten that paradigm is to be fought fiercely- that includes suppressing the votes of those who might vote for a different paradigm- that means fomenting fear and hatred on issues like guns in order to gin up an angry mob to vote against their own economic interests- that includes gerrymandering to minimize the impact of votes of the masses of people who either do not agree with their paradigm or who may not be able to be misled by the promotion of fear and hatredIt is the mentality of the American Colonel who said in Vietnam that in order to save the village we had to destroy it.It is the petulance of the child who if he can\\'t have his way wants to take the ball and go home even if someone else brought the ball.If you wonder why the House Republicans have now voted almost 40 times to try to kill Obamacare it is because if it succeeds not only will they not be able to roll it back but it also undercuts any arguments about the other social programs that for half a century or more they have tried to kill - Medicare Medicaid and most of all Social Security.Panic is the right words to describe Republican actions towards Obamacare.Petulance is another appropriate description.Which is why the White House and the Democrats have to hold firm- for the health (physical and economic) of the American people- for the future (economic and political) of the United States.',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON — President Obama offered a vigorous lengthy defense of his healthcare law Friday dismissing Republican attempts to block it as an “ideological fixation.”In a preview of the message Democrats will carry into the 2014 midterm elections the president acknowledged that the Affordable Care Act may have flaws that will need to be fixed but emphasized that it has already brought substantial benefits to Americans with insurance and will soon help the 30 million who are without it.He asserted that the GOP wanted only to scrap the law not find a solution for the uninsured. “There’s not even a pretense now that they’re going to replace it with something better” he said.But Obama also said he did not believe Republicans would shut down the federal government in a standoff over the heathcare law even though many have threatened to do just that. The federal budget expires on Sept. 30 and Obama and Congress will have to reach agreement by then to keep the government running.Advertisement“I can tell you that the American people would have difficulty understanding why we would weaken our economy shut down our government shut down vital services … because Republicans have determined that they don’t want to see these folks get healthcare” he said. “I have confidence that common sense in the end will prevail.”Obama also called on House Republicans to pass immigration reform saying the bipartisan Senate bill would pass if it were brought to the floor. “The problem is internal Republican caucus politics” he said.He said Republicans should embrace reform because reports have shown that it would bolster the economy bringing new buyers to the housing market and new foreign workers for high-tech firms. He also noted that it would secure the border with “unprecedented resources.”“I think that the speaker [of the House] and others have said they need to do something. And I’d urge when they get back [to the Capitol] to do something. Put forward a bill that has an opportunity to actually pass” he said. “It may not be precisely what’s in the Senate bill. My preference would be for them to go ahead and call the Senate bill but if they’ve got some additional ideas I think the Senate’s happy to consider them.”AdvertisementThe president’s defense of his top domestic priorities came in an hourlong White House news conference a day before he was scheduled to head to Martha’s Vineyard for a vacation.Obama also defended his unilateral decision to delay a requirement that large employers provide insurance or pay a fine a key part of the Affordable Care Act. He characterized it as “a technical change” that he should have been able to work out with Congress.“In a normal political environment it would have been easier for me to simply call up the speaker and say ‘You know what? This is a tweak that doesn’t go to the essence of the law’” Obama said.That remark irritated Republicans.Advertisement“We were all scratching our heads when he claimed that he couldn’t get Congress to help him delay the mandate because Republicans in Congress tried to delay the mandates only to have the president issue a veto threat” said Don Stewart a spokesman for Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.Republicans want to overturn Obama’s healthcare law said Brendan Buck a spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) “because it is driving up costs decreasing access and destroying American jobs.”“We should enact a step-by-step common-sense approach that starts with lowering costs” Buck said.Obama suggested that there would be other problems with the healthcare law besides his decision to delay the employer mandate but he said that none would be reason to abandon his top domestic achievement.Advertisement“There is no doubt that in implementing the Affordable Care Act — a program of this significance — there are going to be some glitches. No doubt about it. There are going to be things where we say ‘You know what? We should have thought of that earlier or this would work a little bit better or this needs an adjustment’” the president said. He said the same was true for Social Security Medicare new cars and Apple iPads.“Our goal is to actually deliver high-quality affordable healthcare for people and to reform the system so costs start going down and people start getting a better bang for the buck” he said. “And I make no apologies for that.”christi.parsons@latimes.comAdvertisementFollow Politics Now on Twitter and Facebookchristi.parsons@latimes.comTwitter: @cparsons',\n",

Mark Begich (D-Alaska). “Alaskans should be appreciating the critical benefits of the Affordable Care Act but there is an understandable crisis in confidence because the administration has yet to get it off the ground.”PHOTOS: The battle over ObamacareOne Senate aide who asked for anonymity to discuss the private conversation said it was clear the White House knows it has a “messaging problem” but not that it has “any immediate fixes to it which was disconcerting.”Obama advisors are fighting a crisis of faith among Democrats as they try to muscle the marketplaces through the rough patch and into widespread use. Already 11 Senate Democrats have signaled their support for extending the enrollment deadline a delay that administration officials fear could lead to an unraveling of the larger policy.AdvertisementWhite House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough has personally led efforts to reassure balky Democrats traveling to Capitol Hill and routinely talking with those up for reelection in 2014.But nervousness remains.“I am very frustrated with the rollout of the exchanges.

Among the questions is whether he described the program accurately over the last three years when he said people could keep their old plans if they desired. But plans that don’t meet the new Obamacare standards are grandfathered in only if they were purchased before the law was signed in 2010.House Republicans stoked concerns about the grandfather clause Wednesday by announcing the House would vote next week on the “Keep Your Health Plan Act” which would allow insurance plans being offered today to continue into next year.The bill’s author Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.) calls it a “voluntary escape hatch” for people who want to keep their old coverage.AdvertisementPHOTOS: 2013’s memorable political momentsAfter the White House meeting Obama traveled to Dallas for a Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee fundraiser and to promote healthcare enrollment.

Fortunately all the data suggest that Obamacare is actually working. Americans will now have brochures with actual plans and options to choose from. They can now compare reality with the lies they heard.Anyone wondering why Right Wing Republicans are in overdrive to shut the government down lest Obamacare is defunded realizes the eyes of many Americans are about to be opened. The millions that will see not a giveaway but help in getting access to affordable health insurance screenings and health care for the first time in years are also voters.

Two years ago the women died within two months of each other. Sokol had no job no income and no place to live.In January Sokol had quadruple bypass surgery at Virginia Hospital Center which absorbed the costs. He didn’t qualify for Medicaid because Virginia doesn’t allow single men no matter how poor on Medicaid unless they’re disabled. The state has one of the strictest eligibility standards in the country. That would change if the state expanded its program under the health law.At the same time Sokol’s income is too low to allow him to get federal subsidies to help pay for a private policy on the exchange. (The law assumed people with incomes below 100 percent of the poverty level or about $11500 would be covered by Medicaid but many states balked at enlarging their programs after the Supreme Court said the expansions were optional.) Arlington Free Clinic officials said about half of their patients are in the same situation: They are below the poverty line but aren’t eligible either for Medicaid or subsidies to buy insurance.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAfter Sokol had surgery the Arlington clinic agreed to take him on as a patient as part of an agreement with Virginia Hospital Center. That agreement is one way people can become patients at the clinic; other patients come in by way of the lottery or via referrals from homeless and domestic-abuse shelters.“Most of our members would love to go out of business and close their doors if there was a program that ended uninsurance” Nicole Lamoureux Busby executive director of the National Association of Free and Charitable Clinics said. “But this isn’t universal health care. We’re not planning to see a dramatic decrease in our patients.”Busby said that many of the clinics she works with are facing an additional hurdle with the health law: Convincing private donors that they will still play a crucial role after millions gain coverage.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“So many listen to the news and hear a 24-second sound bite that says everyone is getting coverage” she said. “The donors may think we don’t need their funds.”An analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation predicted that the uninsured rate in Arlington County would fall from 12.4 to 7.4 percent after the health law is fully implemented in 2022. The foundation estimated that 14000 people would remain without insurance down from the 24000 people currently lacking coverage.The Arlington Free Clinic which was founded in 1994 is staffed by doctors who volunteer their time when they aren’t at their regular jobs. To be eligible for the clinic individuals must be over 18 live in Arlington County and earn less than 200 percent of the poverty line or about $23000 for an individual. They must also have been in the United States for at least a year.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementOn a recent Tuesday the line for the lottery went around the block. It included a wide range of patients including young children and the middle-aged who spoke English Spanish Arabic and Mandarin and other languages.“I need a doctor for a lot of things” said Ebtsam Ibrahim a 46-year-old Egyptian woman and mother of four. She said she has had a toothache for two years but hasn’t seen a dentist because of the cost. She was trying for the third time to win the lottery.Nazmun Nahar a 33-year-old mother of three arrived cradling her one-year-old daughter in her arms. She and her husband are Bangladeshi immigrants who became American citizens over a decade ago.Story continues below advertisementBecause Nahar’s husband makes about $30000 a year working at Subway the family of five would likely qualify for generous subsidies to buy private health coverage under Obamacare. But like many of the lottery hopefuls Nahar knew little about the law or how it would work.Advertisement“I just heard a little about it but nobody explained it to me” she said.Jan Strucker 59 was one of the few people who was aware of the new insurance marketplaces. A retired nurse she lives on about $20000 a year in worker’s compensation. She has serious health issues and may soon need surgery. She figures she would be eligible for subsidies under the law. But that means she needs to wait until October to enroll and coverage won’t kick in until January.Story continues below advertisement“This is ridiculous. This is shameful” Strucker said. “And we’re only seven minutes from the White House.”By mid-morning the winning lottery tickets had been selected for 28 participants. A beaming Ibrahim the Egyptian mother was among the winners. A husband and wife from Russia also won one ticket that day. Each insisted that the other be the first to take advantage of the free health care moving some clinic staff members to tears.AdvertisementLottery winners must go through an eligibility screening before their first appointment with a doctor typically weeks later.The other people who took part in the lottery including Nahar and Strucker went home empty-handed. Some will qualify for benefits under the health law. Others will likely return to the lottery hoping to land a slot at the clinic.Story continues below advertisementVidal Grajeda 68 a retired painter and landscaper who previously won a spot through the lottery was with his wife Nicolasa Grajeda 64 who took part in the lottery but did not win.“I’m a patient and very grateful to the clinic” he said. He doesn’t qualify for Medicare because he didn’t work long enough in the United States. At the clinic he receives treatment for diabetes high cholesterol high blood pressure and knee problems. He asked the clinic’s director of clinical administration Jody Steiner Kelly whether the clinic will be open and working after Oct. 1 when people can start enrolling in coverage offered under Obamacare.“Yes the clinic will be here” replied Kelly.',\n",
       " 'As of now Americans are required to obtain health insurance by March 31 or will face a penalty under the individual mandate. Some have suggested the penalty could be delayed given the problems with the Web site might prevent people who otherwise want insurance from obtaining it.The White House on Wednesday announced it would give Americans six weeks longer than previously thought -- until March 31 -- to enroll before facing a penalty but also said the change had nothing to do with the Web site problems.\"Extending this period will give consumers critical time in which to become familiar with the website and choose a plan that is best for them\" the letter states. \"Individuals should not be penalized for lack of coverage if they are unable to purchase health insurance due to technical problems.\"The letter doesn’t state how long the senators would like to extend open enrollment only that it should be beyond March 31. One of the signers Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.) called for a two-month delay in remarks on Thursday.

It has the potential to improve the quality of care we all receive and provides the opportunity for millions of Americans to purchase quality affordable health insurance.The newly created federal and state health insurance marketplaces are intended to allow consumers the opportunity to compare health insurance options and find a plan that fits their needs and their budgets. For three years we have been eagerly waiting for the launch of these marketplaces. However now that the marketplaces are open we have become discouraged and frustrated with the problems and interactions that are occurring with the Affordable Care Act’s federally-administered website healthcare.gov.As long as these substantial technology glitches persist we are losing valuable time to educate and enroll people in insurance plans. Our constituents are frustrated and we fear that the longer the website is not functional opportunities for people to log on learn about their insurance choices and enroll will be lost.Given the existing problems with healthcare.gov and other state-run marketplace websites that depend on the federally-administered website we urge you to consider extending open enrollment beyond the current end date of March 31 2014. Extending this period will give consumers critical time in which to become familiar with the website and choose a plan that is best for them. Individuals should not be penalized for lack of coverage if they are unable to purchase health insurance due to technical problems.The Affordable Care Act has already had a significant impact on the lives of millions of Americans; seniors are now paying less for their prescription drugs critical preventive care services are available for free and important work is being done to improve the quality of care we receive. Americans will now have the opportunity to receive tax credits to purchase quality health insurance and starting in January 2014 insurance companies will no longer be able to deny health coverage because of a pre-existing condition or drop coverage if someone is sick.We appreciate your efforts to fully implement this law and look forward to working with you to accomplish that goal. Thank you for considering our requests to extend the open enrollment period if the healthcare.gov substantial technology glitches continue.',\n",
       " 'President Obama said Thursday he was “sorry” Americans are losing health insurance plans he repeatedly said they could keep and vowed to work with those who are finding themselves in a “tough situation” as a result.His remarks came as a bipartisan bill was introduced in the Senate to delay the implementation of the individual mandate of ObamaCare by one year meaning Americans would avoid a $95 penalty for not having health insurance that is scheduled to kick in next year.Referring to those who are losing their health insurance plans Obama told NBC News \"I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me. We\\'ve got to work hard to make sure that they know we hear them and we are going to do everything we can to deal with folks who find themselves in a tough position as a consequence of this.”The White House while defending the health care law and vowing to fix the problems with the website has not explicitly ruled out the possibility of delaying the individual mandate.House Speaker John Boehner responded to Obama\\'s apology late Thursday saying \"an apology is certainly in order but what Americans want to hear is that the president is going to keep his promise.\"More On This...Thursday\\'s bill was introduced by Senators Joe Manchin D-W.Va. and Mark Kirk R-Ill. who said since the Affordable Care Act was passed there have been “many identifiable problems exposed in the law that need to be addressed.”“We need to start working together to fix this law and make it work so that all Americans have access to affordable and reliable health care coverage” Manchin said in a statement. “We can start with a one-year delay of the individual mandate to eliminate penalty fees if individuals choose to not enroll for a health care plan in 2014.\"This common sense proposal simply allows Americans to take more time to browse and explore their options making 2014 a true transition year.”The legislation acknowledges there are many positive components of the Affordable Care Act that will lead to health care becoming more affordable for all Americans and these reforms must “continue to be implemented.”“Nevertheless it is important to recognize when a new program is not meeting the high standards that the American people expect” the bill reads. “So far the federal healthcare exchanges have failed and we must deliver a better product.”The bill also says that delaying the entire implementation of ObamaCare would not be “responsible” but Congress should take action to make “commonsense reforms” to the law.“Healthcare should not be a burden on consumers which is why we must delay the penalty for individuals” Kirk said in a statement. “Last July American businesses were given more time to provide employees health coverage. If a delay is good enough for businesses it should be good enough for all Americans.”',\n",
       " 'As Detroit enters the federal bankruptcy process the city is proposing a controversial plan for paring some of the $5.7 billion it owes in retiree health costs: pushing many of those too young to qualify for Medicare out of city-run coverage and into the new insurance markets that will soon be operating under the Obama health care law.Officials say the plan would be part of a broader effort to save Detroit tens of millions of dollars in health costs each year a major element in a restructuring package that must be approved by a bankruptcy judge. It is being watched closely by municipal leaders around the nation many of whom complain of mounting unsustainable prices for the health care promised to retired city workers.Similar proposals that could shift public sector retirees into the new insurance markets called exchanges are already being planned or contemplated in places like Chicago; Sheboygan County Wis.; and Stockton Calif. While large employers that eliminate health benefits for full-time workers can be penalized under the health care law retirees are a different matter.“There’s fear and panic about what this means” said Michael Underwood 62 who retired from the Chicago Police Department after 30 years and has diabetes and Parkinson’s disease. Mr. Underwood who says he began working for the city when employees did not pay into future Medicare coverage is part of a group suing Chicago over its plan to phase many retirees out of city coverage during the next three and a half years. “I was promised health care for myself and my wife for life” he said.',\n",

       " 'For a brief piece of background I am a family practice physician in a multi-specialty group of about 60 doctors mostly primary care.I think most people would agree that the American healthcare system has a lot of flaws. One of the biggest flaws is our fee-for-service system in general. It doesn\\'t make any sense but I get paid the same to see someone for an ear infection as I do to see someone with high blood pressure high cholesterol and diabetes. Someone comes for an appointment and based on the level of detail I obtain in the history the level of detail needed in physical examination and the complexity of medical decision-making that determines the fee for the visit. So as you can imagine an ear infection or sore throat requires a LOT less work than managing three or more chronic problems and the medications labs monitoring tests etc. that go along with them. But again you are paid the same to see the ear infection patient as you are to see the person with uncontrolled diabetes high BP and high cholesterol.On the surface that makes no sense at all but the thinking is that it probably costs too much for the ear infection too little for the diabetes/BP/cholesterol patient but it all evens out in the long run. The rules for \\'coding\\' a level of service for an appointment govern the fees and they are relatively simple as otherwise it would just be too complicated to have a different fee structure for every diagnosis. Anyway the idea is that it all comes out in the wash. That might be true in a simple world but of course we live in a complex world with a lot of moving parts.As you can see the fee-for-service environment does not really incentivize physicians to focus their efforts on chronic disease management. I\\'m not implying that physicians are not trying to do a good job or are just in it to make as much money as possible but let\\'s face it: if you make the same amount per patient and you can see 30 patients with ear infections or 15 diabetic/hypertensive/hyperlipidemic patients which would you choose? How would you set up your schedule?Everyone agrees that prevention is the most cost-effective way to keep people healthy. Vaccines for example are arguably the single most cost-effective thing in all of medicine (get your flu vaccine if you have not already done so by the way!). Preventative care is now covered without a co-pay because of the ACA. That is awesome. However better care/control of chronic disease doesn\\'t pay well as discussed above. But better control of diabetes of BP of cholesterol of COPD of asthma of heart failure will save lots and lots and lots of money in the long run because complications of all these diseases are expensive. It costs a LOT to be in the hospital to have a heart bypass to have dialysis etc. A rough estimate is that a well-controlled diabetic costs the system an average of $4000 per year to take care of but an uncontrolled diabetic will cost $16000 or more. So why would we pay doctors the same for an ear infection as we would to take care of serious chronic disease?Part of the answer unfortunately is that people switch insurances and by the time they develop more significant complications they are on Medicare anyway so UHC Humana Anthem don\\'t need to worry about paying for dialysis. In the long run though it saves us all money if we do a better job of taking care of chronic illness. So it makes sense to try to incentivize doctors to improve our chronic disease management instead of incentivizing doctors to just see as many patients as possible in the day.So enough background. Here\\'s the good stuff. The ACA provides funding and guidance for a new way to approach health care. The Comprehensive Primary Care initiative is a program that involves about 500 practices across the country in several geographic areas. Southwest Ohio/N. KY New Jersey Arkansas Colorado New York Oregon and Oklahoma have participating practices. Practices were selected based on a number of factors including past willingness to participate in such things as NCQA quality recognition and patient-centered medical home (PCMH) certification. You can read more here: http://innovation.cms.gov/...Basically CMS (center for Medicare and Medicaid services) provides funding outside of the fee-for-service environment for practices to do a better job of chronic disease management. There is/was a detailed application process and multiple milestones you have to meet but a lot of it boils down to CMS providing additional monies for practices to use as they see fit in order to help improve the care for their patients particularly (although not exclusively) those with higher risk chronic illness.The whole thing is actually really interesting. While there are quite a lot of specifics there are also a lot of areas open to interpretation. CMS is partnering with multiple private insurance carriers to provide a monthly fee (outside of any appointment or fee-for-service interaction) to physician practices in order to help those practices invest in infrastructure which will help improve patient care. The amount per patient per month is based on risk assessment. Basically the more diagnoses and the more complicated a patient is the higher the monthly fee. A well-controlled diabetic would have a lower fee than a diabetic with chronic kidney disease heart disease and neuropathy. So right off the bat you can see how this is a paradigm shift from the traditional fee-for-service environment. You may actually be paid more to take care of a more complicated person and try to keep them out of the hospital.However and this is a BIG part the money from this CPC initiative can NOT be paid to physicians as compensation. It is to be used to improve infrastructure. This is actually pretty cool because instead of just paying doctors more and saying \"hey if we pay you more you\\'ll do a better job right?\" CMS is saying \"we will give you money to use as you see fit (within the structure of our program and its milestones) to improve patient care which should improve outcomes decrease severe complication rates improve patient satisfaction and eventually decrease overall costs through an investment up front.\"If you hadn\\'t already guessed my group has several practices involved in the CPCI program and we are excited about it. I don\\'t know what the other 490-some practices across the country are doing but we have used the money to hire more staff including what we call Care Coordinators for each office an RN who can reach out to patients before during and after appointments to see how we can better coordinate care. We try to have labs drawn before folks come for appointments so we can have already reviewed the results before walking in the room. This allows for more efficient care. If someone\\'s cholesterol is not to goal for example we can increase the dose of their cholesterol medication while sitting with them and explaining why an LDL goal of under 70 is the target. This works a lot better than a medical assistant calling someone and playing phone tag three days after their appointment to try to make sure they know that the new dose is 40 mg instead of 20. Anyway the Care Coordinator can help reach out to people who might need help paying for meds and see what assistance programs might help someone. She can help someone who was recently in the hospital understand their new medication regimen and help set up their follow up. If someone doesn\\'t go for the colonoscopy or mammogram that we ordered she can call them and find out why and/or encourage them to go (and maybe mention that preventative care is covered 100% now!). She can review their chart ahead of time and put in a reminder for the doctor that the patient is due for a pneumonia vaccine or a shingles vaccine. This is all part of the team-based approach to care which is helping to improve patient outcomes. Our practice would not really been able to afford a Care Coordinator without the CPCI monies. Our group has also decided to hire a diabetes educator. Insurance is often squirrelly about paying for diabetes education despite study after study clearly showing the benefits. Now we will be able to offer diabetes eduction free of charge to all of our patients. This is pretty great all around. The doctors get more help the patients get more individualized attention and care outcomes improve which specifically means someone didn\\'t have a stroke. Someone didn\\'t lose their vision because of diabetes. Someone had a precancerous colon polyp removed instead of being diagnosed with metastatic cancer a couple years later. Someone\\'s grandmother didn\\'t lose her foot. Oh and all that stuff also saves money.That\\'s the other piece of the CPCI which is a multi-year venture: \"shared savings.\" You can calculate how much a population of patients is likely to cost over say three years based on how sick they are. If people get their blood pressure cholesterol blood sugar asthma under better control they will cost less to take care of because they will have fewer ER visits fewer hospitalizations fewer procedures. Sure they might take more medications get more frequent lab tests maybe more frequent (outpatient) doctor appointments but this leads to an overall reduction of the cost of care. So for the additional work to do a better job of taking care of patients practices in each region get a chance to share in the $$ saved by providing more efficient care. This will be calculated and distributed equally among the 75 or so practices in each region.There\\'s of course a lot more to the story but this diary is already rather lengthy. I\\'m excited about the program though. It really is a win-win. It has a lot of the things that us progressives like: government-initiated innovation. Science-based (or to use the medical buzzword evidence-based) care. Regulations on how the money can be used with the greater good in mind. Short term investment for long term success (I didn\\'t mention that the money is eventually phased out with the hope that the infrastructure improvements will lead to overall better reimbursements and a focus on \"pay-for-performance\" or better pay for better quality care). Using government dollars to help those who need it most (ie sicker patients). Shared benefits in the long run for all of us. If we are all healthier we cost less to the healthcare system. We are more productive workers. We have fewer people on disability. We end up putting more $$ back into the economy and indirectly increase government revenue (if you can work more and make more money because you are healthier you end up paying more taxes and of course can purchase more goods and services).Anyway it\\'s a relatively small part of the ACA and unless you go to a practice involved in the CPCI you likely would never hear about it. But in the long run the idea is that the extra $$ will help to transform how we provide care therefore leading to a sea change in primary care across the country. If you get better outcomes improve patient satisfaction AND save money while practicing a certain way every practice is going to want to adopt these methods. Over the next few years the 500 practices will be sharing (HIPAA-compliant) data successes and failures to try to come up with \"best practices\" we can all use to keep people healthier longer. Because everyone benefits from that and that is really what the Affordable Care Act is about.',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON — Healthcare for the nation’s poor once viewed as especially vulnerable in this era of budget cutting has emerged as a surprisingly secure government entitlement with as much political clout as the Medicare and Social Security retirement programs.Even as President Obama and congressional Republicans gear up for a new budget battle Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program which together provide coverage to more than 1 in 5 Americans and almost 1 in 3 Californians over the course of a year appear off-limits despite their huge price tag.AdvertisementThe president protected Medicaid in 2011 when Congress and the White House slashed $1.2 trillion in federal spending including on Medicare — the healthcare plan for seniors and disabled people — as part of a deal to raise the nation’s debt limit.Medicaid was spared again last month in the budget compromise that raised tax rates on high-income households — a deal that included even more Medicare cuts.AdvertisementNow with Obama banking on a dramatic Medicaid expansion next year under his landmark healthcare law the White House is drawing another bright line around the program. The president explicitly defended Medicaid in his inaugural address and top aides have amplified his words since.“Medicaid cuts from this president from this administration are not on the table” Gene Sperling the head of the National Economic Council at the White House declared in a speech Thursday to a healthcare conference explicitly ruling out even cuts that the administration previously had considered.Advertisement“We’ve made a tough choice” to wall off Medicaid from cuts he said making the budgetary trade-off explicit: “It means we will have to look harder for Medicare savings.”A major reason for the White House position is the key role that Medicaid plays in Obama’s health reform effort. The president’s law is slated to provide nearly $1 trillion in new federal aid to states over the next decade to help them open Medicaid to all low-income Americans for the first time starting in 2014. That is central to the law’s program for expanding insurance coverage to an estimated 30 million people by 2022.AdvertisementPreserving Medicaid funding became even more crucial to the Obama administration after the Supreme Court ruled last summer that states were not required to expand their Medicaid coverage. Administration officials are working hard to convince states to expand and do not want any federal funding cuts that could discourage governors from implementing the law.“There is a big irony” said Ron Pollack executive director of Washington-based Families USA a leading Medicaid advocate. “The fact that the Supreme Court undermined the Medicaid expansion is now resulting in greater support and a deeper commitment to making sure the program is not cut back.”AdvertisementPaying for Medicaid remains a major challenge for states. The program has been jointly funded by states and the federal government since it was created. And many states including California Illinois and New York have had to make painful cutbacks in recent years to balance their budgets by reducing physician fees and paring benefits such as dental care.At the same time Republicans are working to slash Medicaid spending to balance the federal budget. They advocate turning the program into a block grant to states which they say would be more efficient and also put a limit on future federal spending.AdvertisementCutting Medicaid was a centerpiece of budget plans pushed by Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) the House Budget Committee chairman. Ryan’s running mate on the GOP presidential ticket Mitt Romney advocated similar cuts.House Republicans are gearing up for another run at trimming Medicaid as they prepare a budget blueprint that they say would balance the budget in 10 years without raising taxes a goal that would likely require trillions of dollars in new cuts.Advertisement“The need for reform is that much more urgent” said Rep. Todd Rokita (R-Ind.) who sponsored legislation last year backed by 48 GOP lawmakers to cap federal Medicaid spending which would have effectively cut approximately $2 trillion over the next decade. “It is a matter of saving these things for future generations.”But congressional Republicans who tried unsuccessfully in the 1990s to scale back Medicaid will likely have an even harder time now.AdvertisementEnrollment in Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program which was created in 1997 to expand government-subsidized coverage for children has surged by more than 70% since 2000 as states expanded their safety nets after businesses laid off workers or eliminated health benefits.That has meant Medicaid a program established in 1965 to help Americans on welfare is increasingly essential to millions of working families who cannot afford health insurance and to elderly and disabled Americans in need of long-term care. Medicaid is the single largest payer for nursing homes in the country.Advertisement“This is now a middle-class entitlement that touches far more Americans than many people realize” said Colleen M. Grogan a Medicaid authority at the University of Chicago. Half of all Americans in 2011 either received Medicaid or had a friend or family member who received it according to a national survey by the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation.Romney and other conservatives criticized this as a debilitating dependency during the 2012 presidential campaign. But many state leaders — Republican and Democratic — have come to rely on Medicaid despite its flaws to protect their most vulnerable residents.AdvertisementMedicaid also draws important support from influential hospital and physician groups which have rallied behind the program even as many criticize it for paying too little. Without Medicaid many medical providers would have to care for even more patients unable to pay their bills.Just last month a coalition of medical societies including several from conservative states helped defeat an attempt by congressional Republicans to cut federal aid intended to increase Medicaid fees paid to primary care physicians.AdvertisementSimilar lobbying in state capitals has also convinced several Republican governors to drop opposition to expanding Medicaid under the healthcare law. Most recently Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer announced last month that she would take the assistance after an intense lobbying effort by hospitals and businesses which argued that without the additional aid healthcare providers would be swamped by uninsured patients.Medicaid’s political clout will only increase in the coming years as close to 20 million more Americans come to depend on the program under the Affordable Care Act Grogan predicted. In some states as much as a quarter of the population could soon be on Medicaid.AdvertisementFederal spending on the program which topped $262 billion last year is expected to surpass $581 billion by 2021 according to estimates by independent actuaries at the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.Obama’s healthcare law is creating other challenges for many states which are scrambling to get ready for the historic Medicaid expansion while also trying to ensure their programs pay for healthcare more efficiently.Advertisement“We’re a long way from seeing many of these issues resolved” said Diana Dooley California’s health and human services secretary who oversees one of the most cash-strapped Medicaid programs in the country. “But I’m encouraged that there seems to be a recognition of the importance of the Medicaid program. The conversations are going in the right direction.”noam.levey@latimes.com',\n",
       " 'Back to previous pageSen. Menendez contacted top officials in friend’s Medicare disputeSen. Robert Menendez raised concerns with top federal health-care officials twice in recent years about their finding that a Florida eye doctor — a close friend and major campaign donor — had overbilled the government by $8.9 million for care at his clinic Menendez aides said Wednesday.Menendez (D-N.J.) initially contacted federal officials in 2009 about the government’s audit of Salomon Melgen complaining to the director overseeing Medicare payments that it was unfair to penalize the doctor because the billing rules were ambiguous the aides said.Last year in a meeting with the acting administrator of the agency in charge of Medicare and Medicaid Menendez again questioned whether federal auditors had been fair in their assessment of Melgen’s billing for eye injections to treat macular degeneration the senator’s aides said.The agency had ordered Melgen to repay the $8.9 million and at the time of both conversations Melgen was disputing the agency’s conclusion. His appeal continues to this day.Menendez’s office provided this account of his contacts with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services after The Washington Post asked about the role he had played in the long-standing dispute between Melgen and the agency over his billing practices.Menendez who became chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this month is under scrutiny because of his close relationship with Melgen. The doctor donated more than $700000 last year to Menendez’s reelection campaign and other Senate Democrats. And when Melgen needed help with a port security contract in the Dominican Republic last year Menendez urged U.S. officials to press the country to carry out the multimillion-dollar agreement.Menendez is facing a Senate ethics inquiry about two free trips he took in 2010 on Melgen’s private plane to the doctor’s seaside mansion in the Dominican Republic. Menendez acknowledged this month that he had not properly disclosed the trips. He wrote a personal check for $58500 to reimburse Melgen.Meanwhile a federal investigation of what law enforcement officials say are allegations of health-care fraud by Melgen escalated last week when FBI agents and health-care investigators raided medical offices in West Palm Beach where he runs Vitreo-Retinal Consultants. The teams spent nearly 24 hours searching the premises and removing dozens of boxes containing billing and medical records and computer files.Federal investigators and health-care auditors have had concerns about Melgen’s billing practices at various times over the past decade two former federal officials said. In part they have examined the volume of eye injections surgeries and laser treatments performed at his West Palm Beach clinic.But a Menendez aide said Wednesday that the senator did not know Melgen was under formal investigation for possible fraud until the well-publicized raid last week.“Senator Menendez was never aware of and has not intervened in any Medicare fraud investigation on behalf of Vitreo Retinal Consultants” his office said in a statement.The senator’s conversation with federal officials about Melgen’s case was unrelated to the current investigation Menendez aides said.“On a separate issue regarding Medicare reimbursement he has in the past raised concerns with CMS about conflicting guidelines and ambiguity in CMS rules that are difficult for providers to understand and can lead to judgments after the fact” the statement said. “His interest was in making sure providers were not penalized if CMS clarified or changed the rules of the game retroactively.”Alan Reider Melgen’s attorney said Wednesday that his client has returned the government money in dispute but is contesting the CMS audit finding so he can reclaim the money. Reider said Melgen believes he was following Medicare guidelines. Reider added that Melgen was not aware that his practice was under investigation until federal agents arrived at his clinic last week.At issue in the reimbursement dispute is Melgen’s multiple use of individual vials for eye injections to treat macular degeneration. Federal auditors have said Melgen often billed the government three to four times for injections from a single vial according to two federal officials and lawyers familiar with the case.The government’s Medicare program reimburses providers $2000 for each vial so Melgen was billing $6000 to $8000 for each vial.Melgen’s attorneys said the doctor was properly billing for treating four patients with medical injections albeit from one vial.After CMS ruled in 2008 that Melgen would have to repay the government he and his legal representatives contacted Menendez’s office arguing that the finding was unfair the senator’s aides said. Menendez’s staff members had several conversations with agency officials to learn more about the billing rules and the details of Melgen’s case in particular the aides said.In July 2009 Menendez called Jonathan Blum the Medicare director at CMS to express concern the aides said. Menendez brought up Melgen’s case they said in the context of broader concerns about the guidelines.Then in June 2012 Menendez raised Melgen’s case again at a meeting with CMS Acting Administrator Marilyn Tavenner aides recounted. They said the primary subject of the meeting was the implementation of President Obama’s health-care overhaul.The aides said Menendez never urged the CMS to take specific action on Melgen’s case.Blum and Tavenner declined to comment through a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services.Melgen frequently cited his connection to Menendez according to two former federal officials and doctors in South Florida.When federal health-care fraud investigators were questioning him several years ago about his billing practices he invoked the senator’s name the former officials said.“He used Menendez’s name all the time. He would say “Menendez is a good friend of mine and he knows I never did anything wrong’ ” said a former senior federal official familiar with the investigation.In Florida it was more threatening several doctors in the South Florida region recounted. After one local eye surgeon criticized Melgen’s treatment methods in discussions with other Florida doctors Melgen warned that he had important friends in the Senate including Menendez said two doctors familiar with the exchange. They said Melgen cautioned that his Washington friends could arrange an intensive federal audit of the surgeon’s practice.Reider the attorney said he had no knowledge of any comments Melgen may have made mentioning his friendship to Menendez.Melgen came to the attention of fraud investigators amid complaints from other local eye doctors alleging that his treatments were often unnecessary a waste of money and sometimes harmful to patients’ eyesight the two former federal officials and several doctors said.At the same time investigators considered him an “outlier” compared with his peers because of the volume of his billing and the rate at which he administered eye injections and performed procedures on government-insured patients the former officials said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is still ongoing.Melgen “was somebody who consistently showed up on the radar and was being looked at quite a bit” said a former senior health-care fraud investigator. “The sheer volume itself is going to keep him on the radar.’’When federal investigators interviewed Melgen he tried to exert pressure on them by mentioning the names of Menendez and other influential politicians the former fraud investigator said. “We thought it was odd because Menendez was in New Jersey and this guy was in Florida’’ the official said.A second former federal official recounted that Menendez’s name came up repeatedly when Melgen was interviewed by investigators from the Justice Department and the inspector general’s office at the Department of Health and Human Services.“He was using Menendez more as a character reference” the official said. “He thought he was untouchable.”The federal interest in Melgen stretches back 10 years when investigators interviewed Philip Rosenfeld a nationally known retina specialist about the volume of treatments Melgen was performing said several eye doctors in South Florida.These doctors said Rosenfeld who pioneered the use of Avastin injections for macular degeneration to stem eyesight loss had long been troubled by Melgen’s methods.FBI agents recently interviewed Rosenfeld again this time two days before they raided Melgen’s clinic the doctors said.Reached at his home in Key Biscayne Rosenfeld declined to comment.Doctors in south Florida said that they have been fearful of criticizing Melgen publicly and that his Washington connections may be protecting him.In 2010 Melgen scolded eye surgeon Randy Katz for publicly criticizing the quality of his care. According to two fellow doctors Melgen cited his Senate connections and told Katz that he could face a Medicare investigation.Katz did not respond to requests for comment. Melgen’s attorney declined to discuss his client’s conversations with Katz or allegations that his client had threatened other doctors.Soon after the encounter according to a copy of a letter obtained by The Post Katz wrote to Palm Beach doctors in praise of Melgen.“It has come to my attention that certain statements I made have been misunderstood as criticisms of Dr. Melgen” Katz wrote in the open letter. “To be clear I know Dr. Salomon Melgen to be a capable andhighly-skilled vitreo-retinal surgeon. . . . If you hear any suggestion that I have said otherwise you should disregard that suggestion as being false.”Alice Crites contributed to this report.Read more from Washington Post Politics:Exclusive resort at center of Menendez allegationsThe Fix: What we know (and don’t know) about the Menendez allegationsNew Jersey Democrats watch and wait on Menendez',\n",
       " 'Republicans’ efforts raise the same perplexing question posed by The Missourian: What drives Tea Party Republicans and their financial backers? What calculation persuades them that repealing the health care law is worth the risk? Indeed whose interests do they represent?Nearly 6 in 10 Americans disapprove of trying to stop the law by cutting its financing. Even among those who don’t like the law less than half want their representatives in Congress to try to make it fail.It is tempting to discard the Tea Party activists driving the Republican Party as crazy — as some commentators have — motivated by fear and willing to believe that default won’t cause much harm and might even act as a purgative to free the economy of a bloated government.“They listen to nobody but themselves” the Harvard political scientist Theda Skocpol told me. “They are convinced of their rectitude and convinced that they alone are qualified to save America from the dire threat of Obama and his polices. They have worked themselves into a dangerous place.”Their relationship with reality can take peculiar turns. Reflexive opponents of “government” they can exhibit little sense of what the government actually does.And yet the argument that half the Republican Party has simply lost its mind has to be an unsatisfactory answer especially considering the sophistication of some of the deep-pocketed backers of the Tea Party insurgency.There is a plausible alternative to irrationality. Flawed though it may turn out to be Obamacare as the Affordable Care Act is popularly known could fundamentally change the relationship between working Americans and their government. This could pose an existential threat to the small-government credo that has defined the G.O.P. for four decades.',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (AP) — Just two weeks after President Barack Obama saw his Democratic Party put up an unyielding front against Republicans his coalition is showing signs of stress.From health care to spying to pending budget deals many congressional Democrats are challenging the administration and pushing for measures that the White House has not embraced.Some Democrats are seeking to extend the enrollment period for new health care exchanges. Others want to place restraints on National Security Administration surveillance capabilities. Still others are standing tough against any budget deal that uses long-term reductions in major benefit programs to offset immediate cuts in defense.Though focused on disparate issues the Democrats\\' anxieties are connected by timing and stand out all the more when contrasted with the remarkable unity the party displayed during the recent showdown over the partial government shutdown and the confrontation over raising the nation\\'s borrowing limit.\"That moment was always going to be fleeting\" said Matt Bennett who worked in the Clinton White House and who regularly consults with Obama aides. \"The White House every White House understands that these folks driven either by principle or the demands of the politics of their state have to put daylight between themselves and the president on occasion.\"Obama and the Democrats emerged from the debt and shutdown clash with what they wanted: a reopened government a higher debt ceiling and a Republican Party reeling in the depths of public opinion polls.But within days attention turned to the problem-riddled launch of the 3-year-old health care law\\'s enrollment stage and revelations that the U.S. had been secretly monitoring the communications of as many as 35 allied leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel. And with new budget talks underway Democratic Party liberals reiterated demands that Obama not agree to changes that reduce Social Security or Medicare benefits even in the improbable event Republicans agree to increase budget revenues.Story continuesThe fraying on the Democratic Party edges is hardly unraveling Obama\\'s support and it pales when compared to the upheaval within the Republican Party as it distances itself from the tactics of tea party conservatives. But the pushback from Democrats comes as Obama is trying to draw renewed attention to his agenda including passage of an immigration overhaul his jobs initiatives and the benefits of his health care law.The computer troubles that befell the start of health insurance sign-ups have caused the greatest anxiety. Republicans pounced on the difficulties as evidence of deeper flaws in the law. But Democrats even as they defended the policy also demanded answers in the face of questions from their constituents.\"The fact is that the administration really failed these Americans\" Rep. Allyson Schwartz D-Pa. told Medicare chief Marilyn Tavenner at a hearing this week. \"So going forward there can be just no more excuses.\"In the Senate 10 Democrats signed on to a letter seeking an unspecified extension of the enrollment period which ends March 31. \"As you continue to fix problems with the website and the enrollment process it is critical that the administration be open to modifications that provide greater flexibility for the American people seeking to access health insurance\" Sen. Jeanne Shaheen D-N.H. wrote.Another Democratic senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia has called for a one-year delay in the requirement that virtually all Americans have health insurance or pay a fine.On Thursday White House chief of staff Denis McDonough Tavenner and the White House\\'s designated troubleshooter for the health care website Jeffrey Zients met privately with Senate Democrats.Officials said some of the lawmakers spoke critically of the website\\'s widely publicized problems and sought reassurances they would soon be fixed.In response Zients said there already have been some improvements and individuals are now able to sign up in larger numbers than was the case a month ago. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity saying they were not authorized to discuss events at a private meeting.And in an interview on CNN Vice President Joe Biden apologized for the problems. \"There\\'s no excuse\" he said \"We just have to fix it.\"Democrats who have talked to White House officials in recent days describe them as rattled by the health care blunders. But they say they are confident that the troubled website used for enrollment will be corrected and fully operational by the end of November.The spying revelations also have created some tensions between the administration and Democrats. Sen. Dianne Feinstein chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and until now a staunch supporter of the NSA\\'s surveillance called for a \"total review of all intelligence programs\" following the Merkel reports.She said that when it came to the NSA collecting intelligence on the leaders of allies such as France Spain Mexico and Germany \"Let me state unequivocally: I am totally opposed.\"In the House Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois a Democratic member of the House intelligence committee complained that the intelligence committees had been kept out of the loop about the collection of data on foreign leaders.\"Why did we not know that heads of state were being eavesdropped on spied on?\" she asked Obama administration intelligence officials on Tuesday. \"We are the Intelligence Committee. And we did not -- we didn\\'t know that. And now all of us all of us are dealing with a problem in our international relations. There will be changes.\"With Congress renewing budget talks Wednesday liberals have been outspoken in their insistence that Democrats vigorously resist efforts to reduce long-term deficits with savings in Social Security or Medicare. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont an independent who usually votes with Democrats has been the most outspoken saying he fears a budget deal will contain a proposal in Obama\\'s budget to reduce cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security and other benefit programs.Obama however has proposed that remedy only if Republicans agree to raise tax revenue a bargain that GOP lawmakers involved in the discussions made clear they would reject. Moreover leaders from both parties as well as White House officials have signaled that in budget talks they are looking for a small budget deal not the type of \"grand bargain\" that would embrace such a revenue-for-benefit-cuts deal.Still many liberals warn that such cuts aren\\'t palatable even if coupled with additional revenues.\"The idea the notion that we\\'re going to solve this problem or it\\'s going to be OK if we were able to raise revenue and cut this thing back at the same time it just isn\\'t going to fly outside of Washington\" said Jim Dean chairman of the liberal advocacy group Democracy for America.___Follow Jim Kuhnhenn at http://twitter.com/jkuhnhenn___AP Special Correspondent David Espo contributed to this report.',\n",

       " 'But even if the chances of success are small the more the White House presses the issue the more it isolates the ideologues from the pragmatists and the more it separates the right wing from business donors.As Paul Taylor who follows immigration for Pew Research puts it: “It’s better politics if the president wins but it’s still good politics if he loses.”Rebalance foreign policy.For years the administration has talked of “rebalancing” our military strategy to address an increasingly assertive China. The Pentagon liberated from Iraq and drawing down in Afghanistan has taken some modest steps in this direction deploying more of the Navy to Asia devoting more resources to China’s space and cyber threats. But our rivalry with China is not and should never be primarily military. We need to compete on the fields of economics and diplomacy. Unfortunately the civilian custodians of our foreign policy have been bogged down in the Middle East a region that matters a lot but not as much as it did when we were more dependent on imported oil.In the Middle East Obama is now pretty much where he wants to be — jaw-jaw not war-war as Churchill liked to say — and that is clearly where the American people prefer him to be. Talks (hopeful) are underway to rid Syria of chemical weapons and (less hopeful) to find a diplomatic end to that country’s civil war. There is fitful progress in the talks aimed at testing whether Iran’s new president has the will and the authority to put a verifiable lid on that country’s nuclear program. Talks are taking place on the eternal conundrum of Israel’s coexistence with the Palestinians. Success at any of those tables would be a blessing to humanity and a great lift for the president.But while diplomats are patiently tending these negotiations there is time to pay attention to unfinished Asia business. The biggest item awaiting some Washington juice is the Trans-Pacific Partnership an immense stalled Asian free-trade agreement that would do more to counter burgeoning China than any number of battleships.Like most free-trade agreements it has opposition from critics who fear it would insufficiently protect labor consumers the environment and intellectual property. It’s time for the administration to cut some deals crack some heads and open up those Asian markets.Forget the Grand Bargain. Go for little bargains.The idea of a grand fiscal bargain — a megadeal that wins bipartisan support on the whole complex of spending taxes and entitlements — was all the rage a year ago but it has passed its sell-by date. Not only has it proven politically unattainable as long as the House is in thrall to a band of least-government ideologues it has also been overtaken by reality. Even relatively conservative economists concede that the deficit — a very sustainable 4 percent of gross domestic product — is not the problem at least not in the foreseeable future. There is a distant problem for Social Security and Medicare as my baby-boom generation retires and it would be nice to address it before young Americans find the cupboard bare. But the immediate and urgent problems are sluggish growth and too few jobs.',\n",
       " 'Last week House Republicans voted for the 40th time to repeal Obamacare. Like the previous 39 votes this action will have no effect whatsoever. But it was a stand-in for what Republicans really want to do: repeal reality and the laws of arithmetic in particular. The sad truth is that the modern G.O.P. is lost in fantasy unable to participate in actual governing.Just to be clear I’m not talking about policy substance. I may believe that Republicans have their priorities all wrong but that’s not the issue here. Instead I’m talking about their apparent inability to accept very basic reality constraints like the fact that you can’t cut overall spending without cutting spending on particular programs or the fact that voting to repeal legislation doesn’t change the law when the other party controls the Senate and the White House.Am I exaggerating? Consider what went down in Congress last week.First House leaders had to cancel planned voting on a transportation bill because not enough representatives were willing to vote for the bill’s steep spending cuts. Now just a few months ago House Republicans approved an extreme austerity budget mandating severe overall cuts in federal spending — and each specific bill will have to involve large cuts in order to meet that target. But it turned out that a significant number of representatives while willing to vote for huge spending cuts as long as there weren’t any specifics balked at the details. Don’t cut you don’t cut me cut that fellow behind the tree.Then House leaders announced plans to hold a vote on doubling the amount of cuts from the food stamp program — a demand that is likely to sink the already struggling effort to agree with the Senate on a farm bill.',\n",

       " 'Wednesday night House Leadership withdrew legislation to fund the government through December in response to growing conservative criticism that the measure didn’t strip funding for ObamaCare. Congress must pass legislation to authorize continued government spending before September 30 or the government will shut down. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor had unveiled a plan that would split the ObamaCare funding from the underlying government spending but conservatives balked at the plan. Any action on spending now has been pushed to next week.Conservatives led by Sens. Ted Cruz and Mike Lee have argued that any measure to extend government spending authority should also include language to defund ObamaCare. On October 1 the health care exchanges authorized by ObamaCare where individuals can presumably shop for health insurance are set to open. On January 1 all Americans are mandated to have health insurance. On that date as well large subsidies and tax credits to supplement those insurance premiums will begin. Unless the law is uprooted now it will likely remain.Cantor’s plan envisioned the House passing a “clean” resolution to continue government spending one which absorbed the sequester cuts. It also would include a separate resolution that defunded all aspects of ObamaCare. Under Cantor’s plan the Senate would receive the “clean” resolution until it had voted on funding ObamaCare. The Senate would have to definitively vote on funding ObamaCare before it could vote to keep the government open.Conservatives rebelled arguing that the split resolutions offered nothing more than a symbolic vote against ObamaCare and removed all leverage against the unpopular law. Democrats in control of the Senate could vote down the ObamaCare defunding and then quickly authorize legislation to keep the government functioning.The issue is however far more complicated. Funding ObamaCare requires about $13 billion in annual appropriations that is subject to Congressional authorization. More than $70 billion a year however is funded by mandatory spending that isn’t subject to Congressional authorization. In other words Congress could eliminate all spending for ObamaCare but 70% of the program would march on.That said everything in life is done on the margins. Eliminating just a fraction of the overall spending on ObamaCare could upend the whole program. That is the hope of conservatives. And that hope cause GOP Leadership to blink.',\n",
       " \"President Barack Obama was signed up for largely symbolic health insurance coverage over the weekend the White House said Monday. He chose one of the cheapest plans “as a show of support” for the millions of Americans his administration is trying to steer towards the new online exchanges.All presidents and their immediate families get coverage through the military. As Commander-in-Chief any president has a personal physician and he and his family get full care at the White House Medical Unit and the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda Md.Obama didn’t wait until the last possible minute a White House official says. Monday’s the last day to enroll on the federal exchange and on most of the state exchanges as well as Washington D.C.’s exchange.“Over the weekend and in advance of today's deadline the president enrolled in a health care plan made available by the Affordable Care Act on the D.C. marketplace” the official said.Obama who is on vacation in Hawaii had a staffer do the heavy lifting for him a White House official says. He had to be enrolled in person in no small part because his personal information is not readily available in the variety of government databases HealthCare.gov uses to verify identities.“The act of the president signing up for insurance coverage through the DC exchange is symbolic since the president's health care will continue to be provided by the military” the official added.“But he was pleased to participate in a plan as a show of support for these marketplaces which are providing quality affordable health care options to more than a million people. The president selected a bronze plan.” Bronze plans have the lowest premiums and tend to have higher deductlbles.Obama doesn’t qualify for a federal subsidy to help pay premiums both because of his income and because he is already covered.\",\n",

Well known for rewarding donors and continually inflicting as much damage as possible as possible on those he identifies as enemies Walker has amassed a zealous following among the most ideological Republican voters by resorting to the most petty politics imaginable.Sitting in the Wisconsin State Legislature he leapt on the opportunity to become Milwaukee County Executive in a recall election (yes you read that right) when residents of Milwaukee County became angry at a pension deal that mainly benefitted the County Exec and several long-serving members of the Board of Supervisors. RW hate radio and the Republican-loving Milwaukee corporate media fanned the flames and paved the way for Walker. The rest is history. Walker won the recall.As Milwaukee County Executive Walker began to travel the state (at county taxpayer expense of course) to increase his name recognition. His next office naturally would be state-wide since he was already at the top of the heap in the Milwaukee area. He cut taxes for business pummeled Milwaukee County labor unions squeezed public services to near extinction shifted money out of building maintenance privatized as many jobs as he could (ultimately costing the county millions in lawsuits) was relentless in reducing social programs and made use of his Milwaukee County staff and facilities for political purposes including the installation and use of a secret router and private email accounts to circumvent public records laws.In short he didn\\'t manage his public duties as much as use elected office for politicking for his next job. Poor bashing union bashing and dog whistle blowing are very attractive to Republican voters and tossing in a blind hatred of taxes appeals to far too many independents and low information voters.The governors seat was hardly even warm from the heat of his butt when he unveiled the most horrific legislation possible. Taking nearly a billion dollars out of public schools slashing state shared revenue to local governments virtually abolishing unions for every public employee in the entire state whose union didn\\'t endorse him in the election slashing programs for the disabled extreme reductions in state public assistance and health programs along with of course massive tax reductions (to business) led tens of thousands of normally politically sleepy Wisconsinites to surround the State Capitol for weeks.He knew something would happen so he made sure to activate the Wisconsin National Guard. His attempt to use them as his palace guard or goon squad fell flat due to the good leadership of the Guard. I doubt he imagined the full extent of public pushback at his extremism. No doubt he and his staff had to order super sized containers of Poop-B-Gone to get the stains out of their underwear that first week but Walker just loved the attention of the media as could be seen at his 2-3 pressers he held every day.He became a national Republican Super Star and loved every minute of it. I\\'m surprised he could control the drool of anticipation at his next political office. Forget running for Herb Kohls Senate seat; he was becoming popular enough to run for President! He knew exactly how to lure extremist Republican primary voters and doubled down on the crazy laws he signed into office no matter how many times the courts smacked down those laws as Unconstitutional.Campaign donors loved him and funneled plenty of payola into his coffers to enable him to put out tons of ads during the protests to promote his \"concerns for the taxpayer\" and bash protesters. A hundred million dollars flowed into his hands through the end of the recall election and that doesn\\'t even count the ads run by Koch-funded groups like Americans for (the Koch Brothers) Prosperity and similar astroturfs.Republicans love Scott Walker.',\n",

Consumers can avoid the exchanges by buying plans directly from insurers or through brokers.But should they?First anyone earning less than 400% of the poverty line will be eligible for federal subsidies toward exchange-based plans so going off the exchange would likely not make sense.But those who make too much to qualify for subsidies should look both on and off the exchanges for a plan that best fits their needs experts say.The off-exchange policies are required to have many of the same Obamacare protections as plans sold on the exchanges like maternity and mental health benefits plus insurers can\\'t exclude enrollees because of pre-existing conditions. Only a handful of current individual policies that meet strict guidelines will be grandfathered in.So why might one want to go off the exchange?#1: Possible better coverage: Some insurers may opt to offer richer policies or continue grandfathered plans off the exchange to hold onto long-time customers.

But they could be more attractive to current customers than the exchange policies which may be more restrictive in order to keep premiums under control.Share your story: Will you just pay the Obamacare penalty?But some insurers intend to sell the same plans -- with the same premiums -- both on and off the exchange. Those companies are betting on other advantages to make their plans attractive.#2: Less paperwork: The off-exchange policies may also attract enrollees who won\\'t want the additional work of going through the exchange which involves gathering pay stubs or W2 forms settling up an account and waiting for income and citizenship status to be verified by federal agencies.\"You don\\'t necessarily need to go through the extra steps of applying for an exchange policy if you are not subsidy eligible\" said Bruce Allen marketing director at Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina which is selling policies both on and off the exchange there. \"We can get you enrolled in minutes.\"#3: Less government involvement: Some consumers have also told Blue Cross that they intend to go off the exchange because they don\\'t want anything to do with Obamacare either because they oppose it politically or they equate it with government assistance programs such as Medicaid.Related: I\\'m signing up for ObamacareBut shopping off the exchange has its challenges.

       " 'Back to previous pageCruz ends anti-Obamacare talkathon after 21 hoursSen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) ended his marathon talking attack on President Obama’s health-care law Wednesday after 21 hours and 19 minutes — a feat of stamina that seems likely to complicate House GOP efforts to pass a funding bill aimed at averting a looming government shutdown.The freshman senator ceded the floor — and got his first opportunity for a bathroom break — at noon after running up against a deadline imposed by Senate procedural rules. A little over an hour later the Senate voted to choke off the first filibuster hurdle on its own version of the funding bill which is the first step toward allowing Democrats to include funding for the health-care law that had previously been stripped out by the House.Both houses of Congress must reach agreement on funding legislation by Monday night to avoid most federal agencies closing on Tuesday.( Read a transcript of Cruz’s remarks on Tuesday. )Meanwhile a similarly contentious debate is simmering over raising the federal debt ceiling with Treasury Secretary Jack Lew warning Wednesday that the nation will exhaust its emergency borrowing capacity no later than Oct. 17.Despite urging from some of his colleagues not to stage the talkathon Cruz took the floor Tuesday afternoon promising to speak against the health-care law “until I am no longer able to stand.”To most Americans it looked like a traditional filibuster fixed in the popular imagination by Jimmy Stewart’s performance in “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.” But parliamentary procedures already in place meant that Cruz eventually would have to yield the floor.Cruz’s controversial strategy shrank the window available for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) and his colleagues to respond with a different version of the legislation.(INTERACTIVE: Longest filibusters of all time )By 5 a.m. the length of Cruz’s marathon discourse had surpassed lengthy filibusters by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) in March and the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) in 1964. He earned a lead spot on all three network morning news shows acknowledging that he was “a little bit” tired but still looking remarkably fresh. The television anchors dubbed Cruz’s effort a “talkathon” even as they explained to viewers that his effort would not derail the legislative process.The senator still wearing the dark suit and light blue tie he had donned the previous day kept his composure throughout his marathon presentation.The Cruz talkathon was the latest example of the increasingly stark division among Republicans both on Capitol Hill and nationally. The Texas newcomer just 42 and nine months into his first term in office is carrying the banner for conservatives who urge a take-no-prisoners approach in confronting the president even if it means shuttering the government.But the move angered senior Republicans who complained that Cruz and the other junior senators pushing this strategy did not understand the wounds the GOP suffered during the mid-1990s shutdown battles with President Bill Clinton. Back then the party controlled both the House and Senate a luxury compared with its tenuous majority in the House today.“I just don’t believe anybody benefits from shutting the government down and certainly Republicans don’t. We learned that in 1995” said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (Utah) the dean of the GOP caucus. “We’re in the minority. We have to find a way of standing up for our principles without immolating ourselves in front of everybody in a way when we don’t have the votes to do it.”Some suggested that the clashing approaches were the latest evidence of a party adrift both on policy and strategic thinking. “We haven’t had much of a strategy on anything to this point. Everybody’s shooting from the hip” said Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.).Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) originally preferred a different approach that would have required Democrats to vote for the health-care funds while GOP senators could have symbolically opposed.Cruz played a leading role along with outside conservative groups in pushing House Republicans to take a harder line. House Republicans on Friday passed a bill without funding for Obamacare exactly as Cruz wanted.McConnell had hoped that he could get Cruz and his band of allies to relent so that the Senate could pass something by Friday. He even convened an extra meeting in addition to the weekly Tuesday policy luncheon at which several senators said Cruz was urged to drop some of his delaying tactics so that Boehner could get the legislation before late Sunday or early Monday.But Cruz would not budge.“We don’t need fake fights. We don’t need fake votes. We need real change. We need a better economy. We need more jobs” Cruz said early Tuesday afternoon rejecting the original Boehner-McConnell plan.All through the night and well into the morning Cruz’s oratory touched on a broad mix of subjects and sources including lyrics from a song by country music star Toby Keith; quotations from the popular reality television show “Duck Dynasty;” recollections of how his father Rafael Cruz used to make green eggs and ham for breakfast; and a recent acceptance speech by actor Ashton Kutcher at an awards show.At one point Tuesday night Cruz opted to read bedtime stories to his two young daughters who he said were home in Texas watching television with his wife. Cruz first read King Solomon’s Wise Words from the Book of Proverbs and then the Dr. Seuss classic “Green Eggs and Ham” which he said was one of his favorite children’s books.Several times Cruz read supportive messages sent to his office via Twitter.Cruz was permitted to yield to colleagues for long-form questions but could not leave the floor or sit while his effort was under way.Several like-minded Senate conservatives took turns giving him respite Tuesday evening including Paul and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) two 2016 presidential aspirants. Rubio returned to the Senate floor Wednesday morning along with Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.).Cruz’s most frequent partner has been Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) who at times phrased “questions” that stretched for almost an hour and included detailed critiques of Supreme Court decisions and a series of recollections from his younger years all designed to draw attention to his concerns about the health-care law.The extended discourse by Cruz and Lee is the culmination of a strategy they began developing in the summer when Lee first elected in 2010 started looking for allies to defund the health-care law by using annual spending bills for federal agencies as potential leverage.Lee and Cruz launched a commercial campaign that targeted fellow Republicans with ads designed to pressure GOP senators to support the pair’s shutdown strategy. Senior colleagues have rejected the approach and instead have grown more angry.A series of junior Democratic senators presided over the Senate chamber through the night as Cruz talked on and on and on. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) passed the time scanning her iPad. Reporters spotted Sen. Chris Murphy (Conn.) returning to the U.S. Capitol shortly before 11 p.m. with a Red Bull in hand.“There’s no point to this other than advancing the career of one or two senators” Murphy said as he wrapped up his two-hour shift around 1 a.m.As dawn neared Cruz began leaning more on the podium at his desk which was surrounded by binders and stacks of paper. In case he ever lost his sense of place a large yellow Post-it note reminded him in blue ink: “Yield only for the purpose of a question. Be careful!”Rosalind Helderman and Jeff Simon contributed to this report.RELATED: 25 leading conservative voices',\n",
       " 'As he tried to reframe the national discussion about healthcare reform on Wednesday President Obama uttered an outright fib: “This debate has never been about right or left” he said of the ceaseless fighting over his healthcare plan.Oh yes it has. And is.Faced with a blizzard of bad PR as a result of a faltering website that had been designed as the main portal for those seeking insurance under the plan Obama went to Boston to park himself in the place where Republicans and Democrats passed a state health program that served as a model for the national one.His intent was multi-pronged: By location he sent the reminder that in places where all parties worked to pass and improve healthcare reform the program has succeeded. (And he pointed out that was accomplished under a Republican governor Mitt Romney the man he defeated in 2012). By topic he accented the popular aspects of healthcare reform as if to remind people that there was a reason that politicians have tried to pull off insurance reform for decades.AdvertisementBut in trying to re-argue the case for a program passed several years ago — and not sold well in the interim — Obama faces an intractable question: Is anyone listening?Recent polling shows that views of healthcare reform have frozen in place and along partisan lines.According to a survey taken by the Pew Research Center in mid-October about 4 in 10 Americans approved of the healthcare law and 5 in 10 disapproved.But among Democrats 75% approved. Among Republicans 85% disapproved. And their views have apparently hardened; apart from a slight increase in disapproval among Republicans hardly any group changed their tune from a September Pew poll.AdvertisementRepublicans have noted time and again that the national plan was passed by Democrats against GOP objections making it different at the outset from the bipartisan Massachusetts measure. Nonetheless the president’s remarks Wednesday appeared intended to reach over the squabbling right-left divide to reassure Americans that what was passed wasn’t as life-altering as its opponents have made it out to be and in fact had some popular components.“A true patients’ bill of rights” he called it. “No more discrimination against kids with preexisting conditions. No more dropping your policy when you get sick and need it most. No more lifetime limits or restricted annual limits. Most plans now have to cover free preventive care like mammograms and birth control. Young people can stay on their parents’ plans until they are 26. All this is in place right now. It is working right now.”He implored those who are uninsured and want to sign up for coverage or those whose existing insurance is being replaced to have patience as the kinks are worked out of the system. He repeatedly said that he was confident those groups would find affordable plans -- once they can gain access to the system that is.He also nodded to the blast of criticism from people whose bargain-basement plans have been canceled because they did not comport with the new minimum coverage requirements for health insurance. He called the insurers who had sold those plans “bad apple” insurers. And he altered his often-uttered statement as the law was proposed and since that Americans who were happy with their insurance could keep it. Now what you can keep he said is “health insurance that works” as defined by the law.Advertisement“If you’re getting one of these letters just shop around in the new marketplace” he said. “That’s what it’s there for.... You’re going to get a better deal.”The danger in Obama’s remarks nearly a full month after the rocky debut of the insurance marketplaces that were supposed to benefit the most needy is that they came after a considerable chunk of the country has either gone to their partisan corners or thrown their hands up in frustration or disgust. A calm rendering of the facts as he saw them might have at least minimized some of the partisan tension but Obama did not pass up the opportunity to dig at the other side.He spoke of governors including some Republican executives who have worked to put the healthcare law into place and chastised those who had worked to block it.“Some are so locked into politics that they won’t lift a finger to help their own people” he said with an edge of bitterness. “If they put as much energy into making it work as they do to attacking the law Americans would be better off.”AdvertisementAnd he said anyone defending the broken system that the law was meant to replace “should have to explain themselves ... because I don’t think we should go back to discriminating against kids with preexisting conditions. I don’t think we should go back to dropping people because they get sick or they make a mistake on their application.”Selling the healthcare law has always been a stiff challenge in some ways giving rise to the same fears that are summoned by discussions about changing Social Security and Medicare. People are always worried that they will lose what they have imperfect as it is. When putting a plan in place whose most visible beneficiaries are people in the minority — the uninsured and the uninsurable — squawks are predictable.At this point however Obama alone owns Obamacare for better or worse.cathleen.decker@latimes.comTwitter: @cathleendecker',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (AP) — Faced with a trio of controversies President Barack Obama is trying to halt a perception spreading among both White House opponents and allies that he has been passive and disengaged as unexpected developments consume his second term.The new strategy underscored in a flurry of new White House actions signals an Obama team anxious to regain control amid controversies that have emboldened Republicans and threatened to plunge the president\\'s second term into a steady stream of congressional investigations.On Wednesday Obama released a trove of documents related to the Benghazi attacks amid pressure from Republicans. He asked Congress to revive a media shield law that would protect journalists from having to reveal information a step seen as a response to the Justice Department\\'s widely criticized subpoenas of phone records from reporters and editors at The Associated Press. And he forced the resignation of the top official at the Internal Revenue Service after the agency targeted conservative political groups.\"Americans have a right to be angry about it and I am angry about it\" Obama said of the IRS actions. \"I will not tolerate this kind of behavior at any agency but especially at the IRS given the power that it has and the reach that it has into all of our lives.\"The president seeking to have a more robust profile on the controversies also said he would take questions from reporters Thursday at a previously scheduled news conference with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. And Obama is expected to nominate a new acting IRS commissioner this week to replace Steven Miller who resigned Wednesday.The president addressed the IRS controversy on Monday but his measured words left many unsatisfied particularly given that he had waited three days to address the developments. He also repeatedly asserted that he was waiting to find out if the reports were accurate even though top IRS officials had already acknowledged the controversial actions.Story continuesAdding to the narrative of a passive president were White House efforts to distance Obama from the IRS scandal as well as revelations that the Justice Department had secretly obtained work and personal phone records of AP journalists. In both cases the White House insisted the president had no prior knowledge of the events and learned about the matters as the general public did — from news reports.Obama\\'s cautious response combined with his lack of awareness about controversies brewing within his administration opened him to criticism from hisRepublican foes.\"If Obama really learned about the latest IRS and AP secret subpoena scandals in the news who exactly is running the ship at the White House?\" Republican National Committee spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski said.But in a worrisome sign for the White House some Democrats also criticized the president for not being more aggressive in responding to trouble within the government.Robert Gibbs Obama\\'s former White House press secretary said the president should have appointed a bipartisan commission of former IRS officials to look into the issue of targeting political organizations. And Gibbs gently chided his former boss for using passive language when he first addressed the political targeting during a White House news conference Monday.\"I think they would have a much better way of talking about this story rather than simply kind of landing on the \\'Well if this happened then we\\'ll look at it\\'\" Gibbs said on MSNBC.The fresh pair of controversies coincided with a resurgence in the GOP-led investigation into the Sept. 11 2012 attacks on a U.S. compound in Benghazi Libya that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans.Congressional Republicans launched another round of hearings on the attacks last week. And on Friday a congressional official disclosed details of emails among administration officials that resulted in talking points used to publicly discuss the deadly incident being revised to downplay the prospect that the attacks were an act of terror.Obama aides insisted the emails were either taken out of context or provided no new information but they resisted pressure to make the emails public for five days before finally disclosing them to reporters Wednesday. The emails revealed that then-CIA Director David Petraeus disagreed with the final talking points despite the White House\\'s insistence that the intelligence agency had final say over the statements.The White House has publicly defended its handling of the controversies. Obama spokesman Jay Carney has insisted it would be \"wholly inappropriate\" for the president in the case of the Justice Department matter to weigh in on an active investigation and in the case of the IRS controversy to insert himself in the actions of an independent agency.However legal scholar Jonathan Turley disputed those assertions saying there is no legal reason a president would be precluded from learning about the investigations before the public did or from commenting on them at least broadly.\"These comments treat the president like he\\'s the bubble boy\" said Turley a law professor at George Washington University.David Axelrod Obama\\'s longtime adviser acknowledged the White House could have acted more aggressively in \"the interest of stagecraft.\" But he insisted that the president\\'s handling of the matters will ultimately be vindicated.\"One virtue he has is that he takes a long-range view\" he said. \"It\\'s easy to get whipped up by the frenzy but it\\'s responsible to react to the facts. It has short-term liabilities but in the long-run it\\'s a quality you want in a president.\"___Follow Julie Pace on Twitter at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC',\n",
       " 'Olga Rudenko and Jesse SingalSpecial to USA TODAYEU%27s foreign policy chief says Yanukovych %27intends to sign%27 dealThe West has increased pressure on YanukovychProtesters signal they may be unmoved even if Yanukovych agrees to signKIEV Ukraine – A European Union official said Thursday that Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych intends to sign an agreement with the European Union but some of those protesting in support of the deal said that won\\'t stop their demonstrations.\"If the deal is signed now I won\\'t leave the protest\" said Dmitry Zhuk 24 a Kiev resident who has joined the protests after his workday almost every day since they started last month. \"I don\\'t think anyone will leave.\"Earlier Thursday EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said Yanukovych who had rejected the proposed deal in recent weeks \"made it clear to me that he intends to sign the association agreement.\"The about-face from Yanukovych could help ease tensions after three weeks of protests and building occupations in the capital city of Kiev but experts and the protesters themselves said that in the wake of a violent crackdown that broadened the protesters\\' demands they are unlikely to immediately disperse.\"People want to keep on building pressure definitely until the 17th of December\" said Orysia Lutsevych a non-resident fellow in the Russia and Eurasia program at the London-based Chatham House think-tank.Yanukovych is scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss a potential strategic partnership on that date Lutsevych said adding that protesters remaining out on the streets could deter Yanukovych from signing any kind of agreement with Russia.Protests have been taking place in Kiev\\'s central Independence Square for weeks and in the past week violent clashes have erupted after large numbers of police and security forces tried to clear roadblocks and occupy buildings and the square itself.The protests were sparked by Yanukovych\\'s surprising decision prompted by Russian pressure not to sign a far-reaching trade and cooperation pact with the European Union at a summit in late November in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius.The parties have a chance to get talks back on track but the frayed relationship between Ukraine and its would-be partners in the EU could hamper an agreement Lutsevych said.\"The main story is that the EU as always says \\'We are open\\' but they were also disgusted and I\\'m sure the trust is lowering every day\" she said. \"After Vilnius it was very low and now after all the violence they used overnight on the protesters … think about it.\"Lutsevych said the violent crackdowns against the protest were \"a kind of tipping point.\"The protesters \"saw that this government is not willing to listen to people and is trying to pretend it\\'s business as usual\" she said. \"But it\\'s not business as usual for them.\"Zhuk echoed that sentiment.\"At first it was indeed the protest for signing the association agreement with EU but after what happened — all the force used against protesters — only someone who is completely ignorant can say \\'OK now everything will change to the best\\' and go home\" he said.Lutsevych said a pact with the EU would entail far more than an agreement from Yanukovych to pursue it.The status of former prime minister and opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko whose arrest in 2011 and ongoing incarceration for abuse of power which many in the EU establishment view as politicized sits atop the list of potential issues.\"The EU agreement will not happen until Tymoshenko is released and all these things are done\" Lutsevych said. \"They may have a declaration of intention to do something but that\\'s not enough.\"She said she expected the EU to ask Ukraine to make certain changes to the electoral code and to the prosecutor\\'s office. The Ukrainian government is trying to \"divert attention to only economic things.\"On the streets Ukrainians overwhelmingly supported accession to the EU. There were a few dissenters.\"The protesting students heard a fairy tale about Europe being a heaven about a visa-free regime and about secure life for elderly people\" said Anna Shyshkova who witnessed protests in the southern Ukrainian city of Simferopol. \"But many of them don\\'t even think about the price that Ukraine will have to pay to sign (the) association agreement.\"I don\\'t want a Greece scenario for Ukraine with 300 billion-euro debt production quotas and destroyed vineyards\" she said.',\n",

China has returned its own complaints -- most recently after NSA leak Edward Snowden alleged Washington has been hacking Chinese computers.Yet leaders of both the U.S. and China -- the world\\'s two largest economies -- know their nations are mutually dependent especially on economy and foreign policy. Should either party try to distance itself from the other the result would be mutually detrimental analysts say.\"For the United States the biggest issue is market access to China and making sure American companies have a level playing field\" says Fred Neumann HSBC Co-head of Asian Economics and Managing Director in Hong Kong.JUST WATCHED In China economics influences politics Replay More Videos ...

Washington slapped tariffs on Chinese-made panels in response to alleged subsidies by Beijing. Under the ruling Chinese panels were hit with tariffs from 2.9% to 4.7% echoing similar spats between China and Europe over solar panels and European winesThe biggest technological thorn in U.S.-China ties is \"the respect for intellectual property created by U.S. firms\" -- and lack thereof says Chris Bronk IT Policy Fellow at Rice University\\'s James A. Baker Institute.This includes \"everything from pirated movies and software to R&D and corporate strategy documents\" because \"losses will cut into the capacity for additional development if the return on investment is insufficient.\"In June the U.S. Department of Justice charged one of China\\'s biggest wind turbine makers Sinovel with stealing source codes from a U.S. competitor and manufacturing new machines. American Superconductor Corporation claims Sinovel\\'s theft resulted in $800 million in losses.The United States loses some $300 billion each year mostly because of Chinese intellectual property theft said former U.S. ambassador to China John Huntsman to CNN in June.In addition to IP theft U.S.-China cyber security issues have come to the fore in the past month after NSA leak Edward Snowden alleged U.S. intelligence agents have been hacking hundreds of Chinese computers since at least 2009.China claimed Snowden\\'s revelations would \"test developing Sino-US ties\" and exacerbate an already \"soured relationship\" on cybersecurity. Snowden\\'s assertions on top of alleged Chinese hacking of U.S. firms depict a clear degree of mutual mistrust. The majority of headlines in China since then have referenced \"strain\" \"tension\" and even \"anger\" between the U.S. and China.The potential and ease for cyber attacks between the U.S. and China will continue to grow says Andy Mok managing director of Beijing-based Red Pagoda and former technology researcher for RAND Corporation.\"When every physical object has an IP address ... the return on malicious behavior becomes much higher. So on both sides -- China and the U.S. -- the targets are increasingly attractive.\"National electrical grids and transportation networks are some of the most attractive marks in each country adds Mok.\"That said the sky is not falling and I don\\'t believe we are weeks or months away from a cyberwar with China that will leave the U.S. power grid in tatters and the whole country sitting in the dark for months or years.\"The chances of direct conflict are low agree analysts. Economic military and technological disparity between the U.S. and China is too great. China is not ready for a clash to occur. And the U.S. -- still on the mend from the 2008 financial crisis -- is unlikely to instigate a conflict with China because of its own fiscal binds to China.Sentiment from top officials appeared to underline this. U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told CNN\\'s Fareed Zakaria China\\'s pace toward market-oriented reforms \"will probably be slower than we would like\" but expects reforms to clearly proceed.Chinese Vice-Premier Wang Yang penned a positive editorial in the Washington Post hoping the U.S. and China would \"forge a more cooperative relationship.He noted that 70% of U.S. companies operating in China made a profit in 2012 the 1500 McDonalds in China have outperformed outlets elsewhere in the world and a flight between the U.S. and China now takes off once every 24 minutes.',\n",
       " 'President Barack Obama unveiled his “Power Africa” program on Sunday that will spent $7 billion in U.S. taxpayer money to fund a sub-Saharan Africa electricity program that will also develop geothermal hydro wind and solar power.The International Energy Agency says achieving universal electricity access to sub-Saharan Africa by 2030 would require $300 billion.Obama said his plan is meant to bring “light where there is currently darkness.”The Obama White House released a statement saying that the president’s Africa plan “will commit more than $7 billion in financial support over the next five years” including:The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) will provide $285 million in technical assistance grants and risk mitigation to advance private sector energy transactions and help governments adopt and implement the policy regulatory and other reforms necessary to attract private sector investment in the energy and power sectors. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) will commit up to $1.5 billion in financing and insurance to energy projects in sub-Saharan Africa. The U.S. Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im) will make available up to $5 billion in support of U.S. exports for the development of power projects across sub-Saharan Africa. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) will invest up to $1 billion in African power systems through its country compacts to increase access and the reliability and sustainability of electricity supply through investments in energy infrastructure policy and regulatory reforms and institutional capacity building. OPIC and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) will provide up to $20 million in project preparation feasibility and technical assistance grants to develop renewable energy projects. These efforts will be coordinated through the U.S. – Africa Clean Energy Finance Initiative (US-ACEF) and supported by the recently launched U.S. – Africa Clean Energy Development and Finance Center (CEDFC) in Johannesburg South Africa. The U.S. African Development Foundation (USADF) will launch a $2 million Off-Grid Energy Challenge to provide grants of up to $100000 to African-owned and operated enterprises to develop or expand the use of proven technologies for off-grid electricity benefitting rural and marginal populations. In 2014 OPIC and USAID will jointly host an African energy and infrastructure investment conference. The conference will bring investors developers and companies together with U.S. and African government officials to demonstrate the opportunities for investment and the tools and resources available from the U.S. government and other partners to support investment.Power Africa will also receive $9 billion from General Electric and other private companies.']"

       "'The agency missed a Feb. 15 deadline to complete a review of the report which has 35000 footnotes referring to 6 million documents from C.I.A. files. It now appears likely that the response offering the committee any factual corrections or broader judgments will be delayed until Mr. Brennan’s arrival.Because Mr. Obama famously said he preferred to look forward not back at his predecessor’s counterterrorism programs the Senate report is by far the most thorough examination of how the United States came to use nudity cold sleep deprivation stress positions wall-slamming and waterboarding methods it had long condemned as abuse or torture.Mr. Brennan will have to decide whether to support making a redacted version of the interrogation report public as the committee is likely to support after the C.I.A. completes its review and as a United Nations human rights adviser urged this week. Several Democratic senators and at least one Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona who was tortured as a prisoner in North Vietnam have said that a declassified version must be released and Mr. Brennan said he would give the request “serious consideration.”He will have to decide whether to convene what the agency calls an accountability board to recommend punishment for current or former officials accused of mismanaging or misrepresenting the interrogation program. If he tries to keep the peace by dismissing the dispute as history and a distraction from the agency’s current challenges he will face strong resistance from the Senate committee’s Democratic majority and Mr. McCain.But Emile A. Nakhleh a former top C.I.A. analyst on political Islam who once worked for him said Mr. Brennan’s work as Mr. Obama’s top counterterrorism adviser intimate knowledge of the agency and blunt style equip him well to handle the task.“It will be challenging but if there’s any person who can take this on it’s Brennan” Mr. Nakhleh said. “He may say some harsh things about the program and some people won’t like it. But the institution will benefit.”'"
