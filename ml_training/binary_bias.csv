0,The following irresponsible police action reported by KHOU’s Rucks Russell should scare many. Here is the story as reported.A young 13 year old dancer Landry Thompson came to Houston from Oklahoma. She travelled with her two dance instructors over the weekend. The intent of their visit was to train all weekend with some of the best in dance industry.When they left the studio Saturday night they stopped at a gas station very exhausted as they searched for their lodging. They were trying to locate their hotel on the GPS. Out of nowhere they were surrounded by the Houston police.The Houston police dragged them out of the car and handcuffed them all.“I was kind of freaked out and surprised by it” said Landry Thompson.“They just pulled us out of the car. Put our hands behind out backs like we were criminals” said Landry’s dance instructor Emmanuel Hurd. “He asked me; who is the girl? She is my student. I said I have a notarized letter from her parents stating that I have full guardianship over her while we are here.”Landry Thompson and the instructors said they pleaded with the police and told the police their story repeatedly. It did not matter to the Houston police. Landry Thompson said “They still put handcuffs on me. And it really scared me. And they put me in the back of the cop car. I was terrified.” Landry Thompson was taken to Protective Services.“I was horrified. She was with the people I wanted her to be with. She was with people who were safe who I knew would take care of her” said Her mother Destiny Thompson. “Yet they had taken her away from those people and now she was in a shelter wherever she was with people I didn’t know.”Protective Services told Destiny Thompson that she would have to fly to Houston to get her daughter. After many phone calls with various officials Landry Thompson was released back into the custody of her dance instructors.“I would love an apology” said Landry Thompson’s mother. “They owe her an apology.”Soon after the trio was back at the dance studio. They intend to leave Houston on Monday afternoon.The Houston police (HPD) has not been responding to inquiries as to what happened.Were Landry Thompson and dance instructors victims of stereotyping and racism?Why did the Houston police believe they had to react as they did? Does it have anything to do with the young dancer being a young white girl and the two dance instructors being young black males? If the two instructors were white males would the police officers have reacted in the same manner? The dance instructors had notarized document detailing that they were the young girl’s guardian. What else were they expected to do to ensure they would not be treated like common criminals but the productive human beings they are?LIKE My Facebook Page – Visit My Blog:EgbertoWillies.comFollow @EgbertoWillies,0
1,SACRAMENTO — “Living in parallel universes” is how Senate leader Darrell Steinberg describes it. Gun control and gun rights advocates “talking past each other.”Emanating from different cultures incapable of agreeing on how to make us all safer from firearms.AdvertisementTheir opposite views were in full voice last week in the Legislature during a marathon 10-hour committee hearing — longest anyone could remember — on gun bills.Unlike in Washington where gun control forces couldn’t muster enough strength in the U.S. Senate to pass legislation expanding background checks a state Senate committee in Sacramento approved eight bills to strengthen California’s already stringent firearms regulations.AdvertisementUnfortunately without universal background checks nationwide — not only in gun stores which already is the law but at gun shows and via the Internet — California is vulnerable to Wild-West dealing in other states.Criminals and mental misfits can buy virtually any weapon they want at a Nevada or Arizona gun show and cart it into California circumventing this state’s tough background checks.AdvertisementActually in Washington there was solid majority support for expanding background checks — 55 Senate votes. But because of that chamber’s arcane rules born of undemocratic filibusters the bill needed 60 or a 60% supermajority.In Sacramento where Democrats overwhelmingly rule most gun legislation can be passed on a simple majority vote.AdvertisementOne exception is a bill to speed up the confiscation of guns from Californians who bought them legally but later were disqualified because of a violent crime a restraining order or mental illness. There are roughly 20000 people possessing around 40000 firearms who aren’t supposed to have them.The bill SB 140 by Sen. Mark Leno (D-San Francisco) requires a two-thirds vote in each legislative house. It would appropriate $24 million to hire enough agents to seize the weapons.AdvertisementBut despite opposition by the gun lobby — it objects to using money from background check fees paid by gun buyers — the measure has been sailing through the Legislature. It passed the Assembly 57-10 last week with only Republicans voting “no.”This bill however offers a clear example of political polarization in the Capitol.AdvertisementRepublicans proposed a perfectly sensible amendment that would have required all the illegal weapons to be confiscated in one year rather than over three as mandated by the bill. Democrats quickly tabled the amendment cutting off debate.“If we’re going to be serious about dealing with felons with guns then we need to take advantage of the money and make it a priority” Assemblyman Donald Wagner (R-Irvine) the amendment’s author told me.Advertisement“A lot of folks on my [GOP] side want to do something. They don’t want to just be saying ‘no.’ But they didn’t even let us debate….“I won’t say it’s impossible to come together. And I won’t say one side is entirely right and the other is entirely wrong. But both sides need to get beyond their hardened positions of the past.”AdvertisementHardened positions however dominated the long meeting of the Senate Public Safety Committee. Republicans followed the gun lobby in opposing every measure. Democrats passed all of them on party-line 5-to-2 votes.“There’s a difference between opposing every bill and your saying ‘We would support it if you did this or that’ ” Steinberg a Democrat from Sacramento finally vented to gun lobbyists. “It would help your credibility.”AdvertisementThe committee approved bills to:•Prohibit the sale of semiautomatic rifles that hold detachable magazines. SB 374 Steinberg. The senator called them “mass killing machines.”Advertisement• Ban even the possession of magazines holding more than 10 rounds. They’re already illegal to buy. SB 396 Sen. Loni Hancock (D-Berkeley).• Require ammunition buyers to pass a background check and obtain a license. SB 53 Sen. Kevin de Leon (D-Los Angeles).Advertisement• Add repeated alcohol and drug offenses as reasons for denying gun ownership. SB 755 Sen. Lois Wolk (D-Davis).• Require long gun purchasers to pass a written safety test. That’s already required for handgun buyers. SB 683 Sen. Marty Block (D-San Diego).AdvertisementThese and other bills passed by the committee perhaps could use some expert tweaking — even gutting — and the gun lobbyists are experts. But they’re such inflexible hard-liners that Democrats ignore them.Just as intransigent were scores of citizens who lined up to emotionally argue for gun rights. They repeatedly voiced two familiar mantras: Gun control laws are unconstitutional because of the 2nd Amendment. And the laws don’t stop gun violence they only harass innocent law-abiding citizens.Advertisement“My rights are protected by the United States Constitution and not affected by an L.A. Times poll” protested one tea party member referring to a recent USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll that found overwhelming support for stricter gun controls.Countering the constitutional argument Steinberg quoted U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia in a 2008 opinion that affirmed the right of individuals to own firearms. “Like most rights” Scalia wrote “the right secured by the 2nd Amendment is not unlimited….Advertisement“The right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.”As for badgering law-abiding citizens Steinberg noted that four killers in the last five mass shootings had no prior criminal records. And the fifth had been guilty only of a minor offense.AdvertisementMurderers often are law-abiders until they’re not — until they shoot their wife or get fired and mow down former co-workers.Also testifying were long lines of gun control advocates including trauma surgeons and mothers some of whom had lost children to gun fire.AdvertisementYes these gun combatants are living in parallel universes. And so are Sacramento and Washington. Too bad they can’t figure out how to fire in sync at the same enemy: gun violence.george.skelton@latimes.com,1
2,"Co-host of MSNBC's ""The Cycle"" Touré joined HuffPost Live host Marc Lamont Hill Thursday and defended his network's all-white primetime lineup. The cable news industry has come under criticism for its lack of diversity generally and within primetime in particular. Though MSNBC has several African-American hosts none of them anchor primetime shows.But Touré said that within MSNBC's modern era there have only been five hosts to fit into three valuable slots -- and the current lineup of Chris Hayes Rachel Maddow and Lawrence O'Donnell is ""brilliant"" and ""extraordinary.""""If you were able to say to me that there is a person who is not brilliant ... then you can say something but we have three extraordinary people"" he said. Asked by Hill whether or not there was an endemic hostility to hosts of color in primetime at MSNBC Touré said there wasn't.""I don't think that there's a barrier to where [MSNBC chief] Phil Griffin's like 'I'm not going to hire a black person'"" he said. ""We have an openly gay woman at 9:00. We are liberal with a lowercase L. We are gonna open the doors to people. I could surely see at some point the right person come along and get one of the spots.""",1

The summit is an annual political conference for US social conservative activists and elected officials. AFP PHOTO/Mandel NGAN (Photo credit should read MANDEL NGAN/AFP/GettyImages)Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) suggested Sunday that the IRS' targeting of conservative groups during the 2012 presidential campaign undermines the election's credibility accusing President Barack Obama's administration of ""blatantly lying to the American people"" and questioning whether the agency would ""deny"" health care coverage for conservatives.“We learned that during an election [Obama] interfered with the First Amendment rights of conservatives and tea party members by intimidating and harassing these organizations” Bachmann who unsuccessfully ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 said in an interview with conservative website World Net Daily. “Once again it appears the Obama administration is blatantly lying to the American people... People can right ask questions [about] the credibility of the elections.""On Friday the IRS admitted to engaging in ""inappropriate"" targeting of conservative political groups during the 2012 election. Agents singled out groups with ""tea party"" or ""patriot"" in their applications for tax-exempt status as well as organizations that took issue with ""how the country is being run.""Bachmann said agency claims that no high-level officials were involved with developing the criteria for extra scrutiny are ""laughable.""“The Obama administration wants us to believe low-level functionaries are the ones responsible for making this decision” she said. “That is impossible laughable. I can tell you within the IRS the agency is very sensitive of jurisdictional authority.""The Republican congresswoman pointed to the IRS' role in the implementation of Obama's signature health care reform law as another potential area for concern claiming that it is ""reasonable"" to ask whether the agency will ""will deny or delay access to health care"" for conservatives.""We learned to our horror in Benghazi it appears that every move that was made was based on politics"" she said. “Now it appears the president was willing to use the most feared agency in the U.S. for his own political purposes.""Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) also tied the IRS scandal to the Affordable Care Act.""[Obama] has a huge problem because Obamacare relies very heavily on the IRS"" Gingrich said during a Monday appearance on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe.""

4,The agency missed a Feb. 15 deadline to complete a review of the report which has 35000 footnotes referring to 6 million documents from C.I.A. files. It now appears likely that the response offering the committee any factual corrections or broader judgments will be delayed until Mr. Brennan’s arrival.Because Mr. Obama famously said he preferred to look forward not back at his predecessor’s counterterrorism programs the Senate report is by far the most thorough examination of how the United States came to use nudity cold sleep deprivation stress positions wall-slamming and waterboarding methods it had long condemned as abuse or torture.Mr. Brennan will have to decide whether to support making a redacted version of the interrogation report public as the committee is likely to support after the C.I.A. completes its review and as a United Nations human rights adviser urged this week. Several Democratic senators and at least one Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona who was tortured as a prisoner in North Vietnam have said that a declassified version must be released and Mr. Brennan said he would give the request “serious consideration.”He will have to decide whether to convene what the agency calls an accountability board to recommend punishment for current or former officials accused of mismanaging or misrepresenting the interrogation program. If he tries to keep the peace by dismissing the dispute as history and a distraction from the agency’s current challenges he will face strong resistance from the Senate committee’s Democratic majority and Mr. McCain.But Emile A. Nakhleh a former top C.I.A. analyst on political Islam who once worked for him said Mr. Brennan’s work as Mr. Obama’s top counterterrorism adviser intimate knowledge of the agency and blunt style equip him well to handle the task.“It will be challenging but if there’s any person who can take this on it’s Brennan” Mr. Nakhleh said. “He may say some harsh things about the program and some people won’t like it. But the institution will benefit.”,1

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)WASHINGTON -- Moderate Democrats working to gather support from Republicans for comprehensive immigration reform sent an ultimatum Friday to Speaker John Boehner: introduce a bill by Sept. 30 or they'll introduce their own.""[W]e are frustrated that there was not a bipartisan immigration reform bill introduced prior to the August recess"" reads the letter from 39 members of the New Democrat Coalition a 53-member group including co-chairmen Reps. Joaquín Castro (D-Texas) and Jared Polis (D-Colo.).""Therefore we write to inform you that if a bipartisan immigration reform package is not introduced in the House of Representatives -- one that includes a pathway to citizenship helps grow American jobs and fixes our immigration system once and for all -- by September 30th we as New Democrats will consider introducing a comprehensive immigration reform bill"" the letter continues. Read the letter here.Boehner an Ohio Republican has said he will not bring up any immigration bill -- particularly the one that passed the Senate in June -- unless a majority of House Republicans support it. Democrats and pro-reform activists think they could get the 218 votes needed for passage of comprehensive immigration reform if Boehner would allow for a vote by keeping most Democrats and winning over some Republicans.Members of Congress leave town Friday for the August recess a month-long break during which they will hear from constituents. Meanwhile the clock is ticking closer to primaries and the 2014 election year.Democrats have said immigration reform should include a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants but many Republicans have said it's a no-go. Instead House Republicans are pursuing a number of smaller bills such as border security legislation. Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) and Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) are working on a bill to legalize undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as children but there aren't GOP-led efforts to deal with their parents. A seven-member bipartisan group in the House is working on comprehensive legislation with a path to citizenship though it has not yet come to a final agreement on legislative language.The New Democrat Coalition letter says Boehner ""can rely on"" its members for support if he brings up a bill with a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.“We have the support of the American people"" it concludes.

6,Story highlights Senior officials say Biden apologized to Obama on Wednesday Obama responded that Biden was speaking from the heart they say Biden's weekend remarks spurred Obama to announce his support for same-sex marriage(CNN) —Vice President Joe Biden has apologized to President Barack Obama for putting him in a tough position that led to Obama’s announcement that he now supports same-sex marriage senior administration officials said Thursday.Obama said in an interview that aired Thursday on ABC that he made his decision public earlier than he had planned after Biden’s weekend remark that he was “absolutely comfortable” with letting gays and lesbians marry.Two senior administration officials said Biden and Obama met Wednesday morning and Biden apologized for putting Obama in a tough spot. Obama responded by saying that he knew Biden was speaking from the heart said the officials who didn’t want to be named discussing private conversations between the president and vice president.Biden’s remarks on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday launched a controversy that led to Obama announcing that his position on same-sex marriage which he had previously called “evolving” had shifted to support. When Obama’s full interview aired Thursday he said his disclosure came sooner than planned as a result of Biden’s comments.“I had already made a decision that we were going to probably take this position before the election and before the convention” Obama said on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” Biden “probably got out a little bit over his skis but out of generosity of spirit” he said.He added that he would have “preferred to have done this in my own way on my own terms” but “all’s well that ends well.”Separately Biden spokeswoman Kendra Barkoff said Obama “has been the leader on this issue from day one and the vice president never intended to distract from that.”Once Biden’s comments drew attention to the issue Obama made plans to announce his support next week on a previously scheduled appearance on the ABC talk show “The View” a senior administration official said Thursday. The president and his advisers knew Obama would be asked about the issue in the wake of Biden’s NBC interview said the official who didn’t want to speak publicly about internal administration discussions.Ultimately they decided to move up the timeline and have him announce his support during the ABC interview at the White House the official said. And a top Democrat told CNN that Obama knew the issue would come up at the convention partly because of a push for support for same-sex marriage to be included in the Democratic Party platform and in debates.Multiple top Democrats told CNN the president’s senior aides are annoyed with Biden for forcing the conversation on same-sex marriage now. One source said Biden has in the past counseled the president against coming out for same-sex marriage making this move that much more frustrating.But the sources said they don’t believe it will create a lasting rift between the two leaders. Biden is known to go off-script something Obama knew when he selected his vice president.In explaining to ABC how his position has evolved Obama noted that his daughters Malia and Sasha have “friends whose parents are same-sex couples. It wouldn’t dawn on them that somehow their friends’ parents would be treated differently. And frankly that’s the kind of thing that prompts a change of perspective not wanting to somehow explain to your child why somebody should be treated differently when it comes to the eyes of the law.”Asked about whether his new position is a calculated move in an election year Obama said it would “be hard to argue that somehow this is something that I’d be doing for political advantage. Because frankly you know the politics – it’s not clear how they cut.”The interview aired the same day Obama attended a fundraiser in Los Angeles where support for same-sex marriage is strong. Movie star George Clooney hosted the event which is raking in $15 million according to a top Democratic source. And on Monday openly gay singer Ricky Martin is hosting a fundraising event for Obama in New York.But some in the African-American community have expressed strong disapproval of Obama’s endorsement of same-sex marriage. A Democratic official said the White House has been actively reaching out to African-American community leaders and pastors and will continue to do so in the wake of the president’s decision but the official noted that even the president’s base won’t always agree with him on everything. “There are going to be issues you don’t agree on” the official said.And Obama told ABC he won’t spend much time talking about the issue because he’s focused on the economy. The announcement puts Obama squarely at odds with presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney who has since reiterated his opposition to same-sex marriage.“And I do not favor civil unions if they are identical to marriage other than by name” Romney said during a Wednesday visit to Fort Lupton Colorado. “My view is the domestic partnership benefits hospital visitation rights and the like are appropriate but that the others are not.”The issue is a divisive one in American politics but it’s uncertain how the development might play out at the voting booth.A Gallup Poll released Tuesday indicated 50% of Americans believe same-sex marriages should be recognized by law as valid with 48% saying such marriages should not be legal – a dramatic shift from a few years ago. A Gallup poll in 2009 found 40% supported same-sex marriage and 57% were opposed.But a CNN/ORC International poll taken in late March indicated policies toward gays and lesbians were tied for last in people’s opinions of the most-important issues facing the country.Obama said he supports states deciding the issue on their own but added that he was “disappointed” by Tuesday’s vote on the issue in North Carolina where a ban on same-sex marriage was added to the constitution. Obama called the amendment discriminatory against gays and lesbians a spokesman said earlier Wednesday.Six states – Massachusetts Connecticut Iowa Vermont New Hampshire and New York – and the District of Columbia issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples while 31 states have voted in favor of constitutional amendments that seek to defend traditional definitions of marriage as a heterosexual union.In February Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire signed a bill that would legalize same-sex marriage beginning in June but opponents there have pledged to block the bill and called for voters to decide the issue. Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley signed into law a bill that permits the state’s same-sex couples to wed as of January 1 and state residents may vote to affirm such a law.Minnesota will vote on a state constitutional amendment similar to the one in North Carolina while Maine will have a referendum on allowing same-sex marriage. Meanwhile two cases seeking to overturn laws forbidding the practice one from California and another from Massachusetts could be headed to the U.S. Supreme Court in coming months.CNN’s Josh Levs Phil Gast Bill Mears Dan Gilgoff and Jim Acosta contributed to this report.,0

8,At various points over the past two years Internal Revenue Service officials singled out for scrutiny not only groups with “tea party” or “patriot” in their names but also nonprofit groups that criticized the government and sought to educate Americans about the U.S. Constitution according to documents in an audit conducted by the agency’s inspector general.The documents obtained by The Washington Post from a congressional aide with knowledge of the findings show that the IRS field office in charge of evaluating applications for tax-exempt status decided to focus on groups making statements that “criticize how the country is being run” and those that were involved in educating Americans “on the Constitution and Bill of Rights.”The staffers in the Cincinnati field office were making high-level decisions on how to evaluate the groups because a decade ago the IRS assigned all applications to that unit. The IRS also eliminated an automatic after-the-fact review process Washington used to conduct such determinations.Marcus Owens who oversaw tax-exempt groups at the IRS between 1990 and 1999 said that delegation “carries with it a risk” because the Cincinnati office “isn’t as plugged into what’s [politically] sensitive as Washington.”Owens now with the firm Caplin & Drysdale said that before the agency’s most recent reorganization it had a series of “tripwires in place” that could catch unfair targeting including the fact that the IRS identified its criteria for special scrutiny in a public manual.View Graphic A report due this week says the IRS targeted groups with names containing “tea party” and “patriot.”“There’s no longer that safety valve and as a result the IRS has been rolling the dice ever since” said Owens who worked at the agency for nearly a quarter-century and now represents some organizations seeking tax-exempt status.The IRS came under withering attack from GOP lawmakers Sunday. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine a moderate Republican described the practice as “absolutely chilling” and called on President Obama to condemn the effort.“This is truly outrageous” she said on CNN’s “State of the Union” adding that even though White House spokesman Jay Carney has said the matter deserves an investigation “the president needs to make crystal clear that this is totally unacceptable in America.”In March 2012 then-IRS Commissioner Douglas H. Shulman who was appointed by President George W. Bush told Congress that the agency was not targeting conservative groups. On Sunday the agency declined to answer questions about whether senior officials asked IRS exempt organizations division chief Lois G. Lerner and her staff in Cincinnati about this heightened scrutiny before testifying it did not take place.“There has to be accountability for the people who did it” House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” adding: “And quite frankly up until a few days ago there’s got to be accountability for people who were telling lies about it being done.”The appendix of the inspector general’s report — which was requested by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and has yet to be publicly released — chronicles the extent to which the IRS’s exempt organizations division kept redefining what sort of “social welfare” groups it should single out for extra attention since the 2010 Supreme Court ruling Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. That decision allowed corporations and labor unions to raise and spend unlimited sums on elections as well as register for tax-exempt status under Section 501(c)(4) of the tax code as long as their “primary purpose” was not targeting electoral candidates.The number of political groups applying for tax-exempt status more than doubled in the wake of the Citizens United ruling forcing agency officials to make a slew of determinations despite uncertainty about the category’s ambiguous definition.Of the 298 groups selected for special scrutiny according to the congressional aide 72 had “tea party” in their title 13 had “patriot” and 11 had “9/12.” Lerner who apologized Friday for the targeting of such groups described it as a misguided effort to deal with a flood of applications for tax-exempt status. She did not release the names of the groups.On June 29 2011 according to the documents IRS staffers held a briefing with Lerner in which they described giving special attention to instances where “statements in the case file criticize how the country is being run.” She raised an objection and the agency adopted a more general set of standards. Lerner who is a Democrat is not a political appointee.But six months later the IRS applied a new political test to social welfare groups the document says. On Jan. 15 2012 the agency decided to look at “political action type organizations involved in limiting/expanding Government educating on the Constitution and Bill of Rights social economic reform movement” according to the appendix in the IG’s report.The agency did not appear to adopt a more neutral test for 501(c)(4) groups until May 17 2012 according to the timeline in the report. At that point the IRS again updated its criteria to focus on “organizations with indicators of significant amounts of political campaign intervention (raising questions as to exempt purpose and/or excess private benefit.)”Campaign reform groups have been pressing the IRS for several years to conduct greater oversight of nonprofits formed in the wake of the Citizens United case given that many have become heavily involved in elections. “But this isn’t the type of enforcement we want” said Paul Ryan a senior counsel at the Campaign Legal Center. “We want nonpartisan non-biased enforcement.”Loyola Law School professor Ellen Aprill who specializes in tax law said any groups that have applied for tax-exempt status has “opened themselves up to scrutiny” by the IRS. “It’s part of their job to look for organizations that may be more likely to have too much campaign intervention” she said. “But it is important to try to make these criteria as politically neutral as possible.”Aprill said one of the problems is the agency’s top officials have not provided clear enough guidelines on what constitutes too much political activity for a social welfare group because it’s been “a hot potato” and that now with this new controversy “it’s going to make it even more difficult to do so.”Toby Marie Walker president of the Waco Tea Party said the IRS subjected her group to a series of unreasonable requests after it applied for tax-exempt status in June 2010. The requests came in early 2012 Walker said after being initially informed by an official in the Cincinnati field office that he was “sitting on a stack of tea party applications and they were awaiting word from higher-ups as to how to process them.”The agency asked the group’s treasurer to supply information on its “close relationship” with current candidates and elected officials as well as future candidates along with detailed information about its contributors and members. It also asked for transcripts of any radio interviews its officials had done and hard copies of any news articles mentioning them.“That would take me years to do” Walker said noting that in some cases Chinese media outlets referred to her organization. “Am I responsible for every news article across the globe?”The group had even more difficulty providing transcripts and details of speakers at its events since they hosted informal gatherings such as “rant contests” where anyone could come and express their views.While the IRS awarded the Waco Tea Party tax-exempt status about six weeks ago Walker said the group was now considering suing the agency since the process not only consumed time and effort but prompted the group to scale back its 2012 get-out-the-vote operation. “We were afraid to do it and get in trouble” she said.Sal Russo chief strategist for the Tea Party Express said that even though the agency’s actions intimidated tea party adherents he gives the IRS “credit for standing up and admitting” it targeted them. And while only two of the agency’s officials — the commissioner and the chief counsel — are political appointees Russo said the administration needs to conduct better oversight.“The culture is set at the top” Russo said. “Obviously you can’t control what every employee does. But you have to set a standard particularly with the IRS to be squeaky clean.”Josh Hicks and Julie Tate contributed to this report.Discuss this topic and other political issues in the politics discussion forums.,1

10,Internal Revenue Service documents showing that the agency might have scrutinized politically liberal groups before it inappropriately targeted conservative ones intensified debate on Capitol Hill last week leaving the agency and its watchdog scrambling to explain themselves.The result may be an already embattled IRS that faces even more criticism and an inspector general risking a compromised reputation.J. Russell George’s May report about the IRS’s treatment of conservative groups led to public outrage agency apologies congressional hearings a Justice Department probe and several dismissals including the forced resignation of acting commissioner Steven Miller by the White House.But Democrats are now questioning the Treasury inspector general’s audit in light of the new IRS documents which show that terms such as “progressive” “health care legislation” and “medical marijuana” appeared on a multipart “Be on the Lookout” list or BOLO that helped agents determine which groups deserved additional screening.In a June 26 letter to the inspector general Rep. Sander M. Levin (D-Mich.) said: “There is increasing evidence that the May 14 2013 audit was fundamentally flawed and that your handling of it has failed to meet the necessary test of objectivity and forthrightness.”George’s spokeswoman Karen Kraushaar fueled that notion when she told the Hill newspaper that the office of House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) asked the inspector general to “narrowly focus on tea party organizations.”Issa’s office has denied it made such a request.Kraushaar has walked back her remarks telling The Washington Post “The statements attributed to me in The Hill are not accurate.” She did not say the article misquoted her.“Several members of Congress shared their concerns about tea party organizations” with the inspector general’s office Kraushaar said in an e-mail. “However the focus of our audit was on the IRS’s consistency in its identification and review of applications for tax-exempt status involving potential political advocacy issues.”George appointed to his position in 2006 by President George W. Bush said in a letter to Levin that his office “reviewed all cases that the IRS identified as potential political cases and did not limit our audit to allegations related to the Tea Party.”The inspector general testified before Congress last month that his office was unable to determine whether any cases in the audit involved progressive groups. He said the names “in many instances were neutral in that you couldn’t necessarily attribute it to one particular affiliation or another.”Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) whose questioning prompted that response said in a recent letter to George that his testimony was “at best incomplete if not misleading.” He also suggested that George should appear again before the House Oversight Committee to “explain himself.”There is little doubt that the IRS erred in its review of tax-exemption applications.Acting IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel whom President Obama appointed to lead the agency after Miller’s resignation said in a conference call with reporters last week that the screening methods were inappropriate.But Werfel added his agency’s 30-day internal review had “not found evidence of intentional wrongdoing by anyone in the IRS or involvement in these matters by anyone outside the IRS.”The BOLO could still be problematic for the IRS. The list’s “emerging issues” category included only conservative-associated terms at the outset raising questions about why the IRS prioritized conservative groups but not those from the political left.The term “progressive” appeared in a separate part of the BOLO and questions remain about when and how that term was used as well as whether those separate BOLO categories were even relevant to the audit. The IRS and George’s office have said they’re still looking into those matters.The BOLO also directed agents to flag tea party cases for further review while allowing processors to approve other types of groups “on merit if applicable.”George’s audit focused primarily on the “emerging issues” category as part of an effort to help identify groups involved in possible campaign intervention — something that can potentially disqualify an organization from tax-exempt status.George has said the IRS did not use progressive criteria to identify groups involved in campaign intervention.“We are reviewing whether these criteria led to expanded scrutiny for other reasons and why these criteria were implemented” his office said in a statement last week.Republicans have downplayed the recent revelations about “progressive” search criteria.“Our Democratic colleagues should stop trying to derail the investigation by defending IRS officials with distorted claims equating the systematic scrutiny of Tea Party groups with the more routine screening progressive groups received” Issa said.House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) said the IRS controversy goes beyond the issue of search terms to the inappropriate questions agents asked of conservative groups and alleged leaks of private taxpayer information.“At this point the evidence shows us that conservative groups were not only flagged but targeted and abused by the IRS” said Camp spokeswoman Sarah Swinehart. “As we gather the facts we will follow them wherever they lead us.”,1
11,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Struggling to salvage a massive surveillance program President Barack Obama faced congressional critics of the National Security Agency's collection of Americans' telephone records Thursday as snowballing concerns made new limitations on the intelligence effort appear increasingly likely.Obama and Vice President Joe Biden joined lawmakers on both sides of the issue for an Oval Office meeting designed to stem the bleeding of public support and show Obama was serious about engaging. Among the participants were the NSA's most vigorous congressional supporters — the top Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate intelligence panels — alongside its most stern critics including Democratic Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Mark Udall of Colorado.The lawmakers departed the rainy White House grounds without speaking to reporters. But in interviews later they said there was a consensus that the surveillance efforts are suffering from perception problems that have undercut trust among the American people.""There is openness to making changes"" said Rep. C.A. ""Dutch"" Ruppersberger of Maryland the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia top Republican on the Senate's intelligence panel and a strong NSA defender said Obama and the lawmakers didn't agree to take specific steps but brought up a number of proposals that will be fleshed out over the August congressional recess.""A lot of ideas were thrown out"" Chambliss told The Associated Press. ""Nothing was concluded.""Wyden in an interview said he and Udall had sought to convince Obama of the urgency of addressing rising concerns. He said he proposed strengthening the government's ability to get emergency authorization to collect an individual's phone records so that pre-emptive collection of everyone's records would no longer be necessary.""I felt that the president was open to ideas — and we're going to make sure he has some"" Wyden said after returning to Capitol Hill.Story continuesWyden and two Senate colleagues also unveiled legislation Thursday to overhaul the secret federal court that oversees the programs which critics decry as largely a rubber stamp. The senators aim to make the court created under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act or FISA more adversarial by creating a special advocate who could argue for privacy during closed-door proceedings and appeal decisions. A companion bill would diversify the court's bench by ending the chief justice's sole authority to pick its judges.""These bills do not compromise national security but they put a necessary opposing view in the FISA court and assure ideological diversity of judges"" said Sen. Tom Udall D-N.M. Another of the bill's sponsors Sen. Richard Blumenthal D-Conn. said the Obama administration was receptive to the ideas although White House officials declined to comment.Debate over the line between counterterrorism and invasion of privacy has been heating up since former government contract systems analyst Edward Snowden leaked classified documents exposing the NSA's monumental capability to sweep up data about phone and Internet use including programs that store years of phone records on virtually every American. Snowden's revelations have prompted a national rethinking over government surveillance powers that have grown since the Sept. 11 2001 terrorist attacks.Russia decided on Thursday to grant temporary asylum to Snowden who has been in a Moscow airport hotel for more than a month despite America's insistence that the fugitive be sent home to face prosecution on espionage charges.In Washington House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte R-Va. said he stressed to Obama the role Congress must play in ensuring that U.S. spying isn't infringing on Congress' intent or on civil liberties. He said his committee would further probe the issue including in a classified hearing he's hoping to hold in September.Extending its efforts to defend the programs to the public the White House pledged to help Americans understand as much as possible about how they work even as it staunchly defended their efficacy in keeping a post-9/11 America safe.""That process will continue"" said White House spokesman Jay Carney. ""But I don't think that we can sensibly say that programs designed to protect us from terrorist attack are not necessary in this day and age.""The more information about the programs the government has released the more it has fed even greater concerns about the scope of the surveillance and whether Obama's national security team has been truthful in describing it publicly in the past.After the administration on Wednesday declassified more documents about an email mining program Wyden said they showed the government had ""repeatedly made inaccurate statements to Congress"" about the effectiveness in countering terrorism. And new details released about the phone records program created new fodder for critics by confirming for the first time that when investigating one suspected terrorist the government can also examine records of people who called people who called the targeted individual — netting millions of people's records in a single request.Meanwhile the head of the NSA openly clashed with lawmakers including Sen. Patrick Leahy D-Vt. over the agency's statements that telephone and email data collection helped foil 54 terror plots.Rising tensions have stoked concern at the White House that surveillance programs Obama considers crucial will soon be undermined or even dismantled — despite the fact that many Democrats and Republicans in Congress have come to the NSA's defense.Leahy the Judiciary Committee chairman has threatened to seek to end the phone records program if it's not proven effective. And Sen. Jeff Merkley D-Ore. signaled Thursday that unless an agreement is reached on releasing more of the secret court's opinions he would push Congress to use its ""power of the purse"" to compel their disclosure by withholding funding for certain programs.Even some staunch advocates for a tough national security stance have become outspoken critics including Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner R-Wis. who helped write the USA Patriot Act but now says the phone records collection goes far beyond what he envisioned and may not be renewed. Sensenbrenner was among the lawmakers who shared concerns in the session Thursday with Obama and top officials including Biden National Security Advisory Susan Rice and White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler.The White House also was spooked by a House vote last week to dismantle the program which failed by a narrow 217-205 margin.___Associated Press writer Richard Lardner contributed to this report.___Follow Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP",1
12,When the trifecta of scandals first broke over the White House a few weeks ago the media (who were literally blocking the truth from getting out about the IRS and Benghazi) were so caught off guard that for a couple of weeks they accidentally acted like real media and just reported the facts. Over Memorial Day weekend that all changed.It is fairly obvious that the media used the three-day weekend to gather themselves talk to the White House and coordinate talking points with one another. The result of this coordination has been apparent in the words “overreach” “McCarthyism” “disarray” and “no GOP agenda” — all being uttered simultaneously across media platforms that are supposed to compete not coordinate with one another.The idea is for the media to revert to form. Rather than seek the truth the media will go back to attacking those seeking the truth. Obama’s approval rating is going down his left-wing agenda and legacy are in jeopardy and the bleeding must be stopped.Another piece of coordination between media and Democrats reared its ugly head today in the most expected of places: Politico. No one takes more glee in savaging private citizens who dare not support Obama than Obama’s bullying thugs at Politico.During Tuesday’s testimony Congressional Democrats attacked the private citizens brought before them to tell their individual horror stories. The witnesses were Tea Party groups and other conservative groups put through months of paralyzing harassment by an IRS that had intentionally singled them out based on their political beliefs.Democrats however did not care about the fact that these groups had been targeted and they kept insinuating that these groups deserved the IRS scrutiny due to their political activity.Well that is not the point and everyone knows it. Had the IRS put the same number of left-leaning groups through the same hyper-scrutiny as they did right-leaning groups none of this would be happening. There would be no scandal.But the idea here is to change the subject from the fact that the IRS singled out Obama’s political foes for paralyzing scrutiny in the run-up to Obama’s re-election campaign to the supposed abuse of a tax exempt status by conservative political groups.The thinking goes that if Democrats can make the Tea Party look like tax cheats it will take the heat off of Obama and further damage his opponents.Well right on cue Politico arrives this morning like the cavalry with an appallingly dishonest (but expected) piece of reporting that falls right in line with what Congressional Democrats did yesterday. It is as pure a piece of coordination and left-wing propaganda as you will ever read.And this is the only kind of investigative reporting Politico ever does. Imagine if Politico poured these same resources into investigating the IRS’s connections to the White House or the shaping of the IRS talking points by the State Department.But today’s Politico piece is all about changing the subject. All it looks at is the political activity of yesterday’s Tea Party witnesses in order to make a case that they deserved scrutiny from the IRS.The Politico piece however intentionally ignores the fact that this is not the point of the scandal. The point is that these groups were singled out for harassment by their own government.The Politico piece intentionally ignores and chooses not to report on all the political activity of tax-exempt left-leaning groups (like Obama’s Organizing for America) — groups approved by the IRS that are every bit as political as those on the right who were paralyzed by lengthy and intrusive questionnaires and threats of perjury-those who had their information leaked to the media.Working directly with the Democrats Politico is now putting in overtime to desperately steer subject away from and distract from partisan horrors committed by the IRS.The actual crime is no longer the story according to Politico. No the story is that the victims had it coming.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC,1
13,On Wednesday President Barack Obama said Treasury Secretary Jack Lew asked for and accepted the resignation of the acting Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Commissioner Steven T. Miller. However Miller’s term as acting IRS Commissioner was up in a couple of weeks and it is presently unclear whether he was forced to resign or was simply granting notice that his term was up.Obama will face reporters on Thursday to answer questions about the IRS scandal that placed nearly 500 conservative organizations in the IRS’s crosshairs during the 2010 and 2012 elections.Beyond the classic question “What did the Administration know and when did it know it?” a myriad of questions remain unanswered. Here are just a few:Who inside the IRS hatched the plan to target conservatives and what if any connections do they their associates or superiors have to the Obama White House campaign team or other political organizations? Who at the IRS leaked confidential tax documents to the progressive-leaning journalism group ProPublica an action which the IRS official manual says can result in up to five years in prison and fines of up to $5000? Who are the two “rogue” individuals disgraced former IRS Commissioner Stevens said went “off the reservation” and acted “overly aggressive” and what if any connections do they have politically? If as the Inspector General report alleges political motivations were not driving the targeting of conservatives then what was? Also what “discipline” did the two rogue agents receive? Did IRS agents coordinate with Sen. Carl Levin (D-MI) or his staff to “go after them [conservative groups]” as he told the New York Times following Levin’s letters to then-IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman and Director Lois Lerner? Did Sen. Max Baucus (D-MO) or his staff communicate or coordinate with IRS agents after Baucus wrote this September 28 2010 letter instructing then-Commissioner Douglas Shulman to have his “agency survey major 401(c)(4) (c)(5) and (c)(6) organizations to determine whether they are acting as conduits for major donors advancing their own private interests”? What communications took place between IRS agents and the following senators and their staffs following the delivery of this jointly written letter demanding the IRS crack down on “abuse of the tax code by political groups focused on federal election activities”: Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO ) Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM) Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Sen. Al Franken (D-MN)? What communications existed between Obama reelection campaign co-chair Joe Solomonese whom the National Organization for Marriage (NOM) alleges received its confidential tax returns and IRS agents? What portion of Obama’s 79% increase in audits of charities were of conservative groups? If political motivations were not driving the selective targeting of 500 conservative organizations then why were a similar number of liberal groups not harassed? What role did IRS Rulings and Agreements Division Director Holly Paz who in 2008 donated $2000 to Obama play in ratcheting up IRS investigations as she promised she would in June 2012?Whether reporters will ask and Obama will answer the critical questions that must be resolved remains to be seen.,1

""This administration has institutionalized the practice of pitting bureaucrats against the very people they're supposed to be serving and it needs to stop.""Speaking to the same organization last year McConnell accused the administration and Obama's re-election campaign of leaking tax information and maintaining an enemies list in a chilling style reminiscent of President Richard Nixon the Republican who resigned in 1974 amid the Watergate scandal.In the first six months of Obama's second term the administration's problems have produced an assortment of political targets for Republicans. One is the IRS affair which has resulted in resignations and departures from the agency. No evidence has come to light that anyone in the Obama administration outside the IRS was involved in targeting conservative groups for extra scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status.Other issues facing the Obama administration this year include government surveillance of phone and Internet records; its handling of last year's terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi Libya which killed four Americans; the Justice Department's seizure of phone records of journalists at the Associated Press and in another case reading the e-mails of Fox News reporter James Rosen.McConnell referred to the IRS episode with a bit of I-told-you-so.""When I warned about all this last year I got slammed by the usual suspects on the left. They said I was full of it"" he said. ""But even some of them now seem to realize that just because McConnell is the one pulling the alarm doesn't mean there isn't a fire. The IRS scandal has reminded people of the temptations to abuse that big government and its political patrons are prone to. People are waking up to a pattern here.""In comments certain to appeal to Republican voters McConnell described public sector unions as power hungry and able to expand their reach with the help of congressional friends. He said the unions no longer serve the public's interest but rather the government's.""There's no better illustration of this than the announcement this week that in the midst of congressional hearings into their activities unionized employees at the IRS are about to get $70 million in bonuses"" McConnell said.Sen. Chuck Grassley R-Iowa said this week that the IRS plans to hand out $70 million in bonuses to employees. Under a contract with the employees' union IRS workers can receive individual performance bonuses of up to $3500 a year.In response to Grassley's criticism the agency said it's under a legal obligation to comply with its collective bargaining agreement with the National Treasury Employees Union. The agency and the union say they are in negotiations over the matter.McConnell used the speech to deliver a forceful defense of the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United ruling which lifted many restrictions on corporate spending in political elections.",1

18,Before an adoring crowd of religious conservatives Sarah Palin mocked recent scandals swirling around the Obama administration performing her own version of a “Saturday Night Live” parody.“They have this skit where they do this fake newscast and they read this completely absurd news report and finish it with an incredulous ‘Really?’ ” Palin told the audience Saturday afternoon at the JW Marriott in downtown Washington. “As in our government spied on every single one of your phone calls but it couldn’t find two pot-smoking deadbeat Bostonians with a hotline to Terrorist Central in Chechnya.“The IRS says it can’t figure out how it managed to spend more than $4 million on training conferences because it didn’t keep its receipts” she said to uproarious laughter. “Really?”“We’re gathering in a town that is awash in scandal” said Palin the closing speaker at the annual meeting of the Faith and Freedom Coalition. “In other words just another Saturday afternoon in Washington D.C.”The Faith and Freedom Coalition a 501(c)(4) organization was founded in 2009 by Ralph Reed as a way to join together tea party activists and religious conservatives. The theme of the three-day conference was “Road to Majority” and featured a lineup of conservatives from Sen. Marco Rubio to Grover G. Norquist to Herman Cain.Palin criticized Obama’s leadership including his foreign policy efforts and argued that the United States should not intervene in Syria but instead “let Allah sort it out.”“Where is our commander in chief?” she said. “We’re talking now more new interventions. I say until we know what we’re doing until we have a commander in chief who knows what he’s doing well let these radical Islamic countries who aren’t even respecting basic human rights where both sides are slaughtering each other as they scream over an arbitrary red line ‘Allah Akbar’ I say until we have someone who knows what they’re doing I say let Allah sort it out.”The line drew laughter from the audience.Speaker after speaker offered strategies for conservatives to win control of Congress and the White House.Cain the former chief executive of Godfather’s Pizza who cut short his bid for the GOP nomination after he was accused of sexual harassment and having an extramarital affair said he had a formula for winning. “ETA” said Cain with the flair of a man who became known for his “9-9-9” tax plan. He said the phrase was shorthand for “enthusiasm targeted races and activists.”Conservatives need to target races and cultivate fresh faces he said. “We have got to stop sending nearly 90 percent of the people in D.C. back to D.C.” said Cain who has a radio talk show. “We should expand what we’ve already been doing. Create a groundswell of activists and citizens and patriots.”Texas Gov. Rick Perry another former Republican presidential candidate told the conference that conservative activists have “a long way to go” to make an impact on national politics and advised them to shift their tone.“We stand for the principles that made America great” Perry said. “We should exude those principals with joy. Smile when you disagree with a liberal. As Ronald Reagan said liberals know so much that isn’t so. Our conservative convictions will win this country back if our tone shows we’re comfortable with our own ideals.”Among the speakers who brought attendees to their feet was E.W. Jackson a Chesapeake minister who was a virtual political unknown until a month ago when he clinched the GOP nomination for lieutenant governor of Virginia. Since then liberals and some national GOP figures have bemoaned controversial Jackson comments including his belief that Planned Parenthood has harmed black Americans more than the Ku Klux Klan and that gays and lesbians are “very sick people.”Jackson offered a fiery 10 minutes on how the left is assaulting religious freedom and trying to redefine liberty.“Freedom doesn’t mean ‘Do whatever you want.’ It’s the pursuit of character integrity decency honor. Now we’re being told freedom is license” he said.Palin the 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate and former Alaska governor had some harsh words for some GOP leaders who have blamed far right candidates for the party’s recent national losses.“To our Republican leadership you don’t marginalize discredit and dismiss everyday hardworking Americans” she said. She urged tea party activists to keep at it. “Start on a local level affecting change as you work on the higher levels of politicos” she said. “Or do both. Just do both.”Americans need to “rededicate” the country to “our one true heavenly Father” said Palin who is writing a book about faith and Christmas and returns to the airwaves Monday as part of the “Fox & Friends” program on Fox News. “If we rededicate our land to our Lord things will turn around.”Staff writer Michelle Boorstein contributed to this report.,1

21,Now the immigration debate is really getting juicy.Rep. Steve King an Iowa Republican has always been a bit of a melon head but he outdid himself in an interview that came to light this week in which he described “DREAMers” — people brought to this country illegally as children — as misshapen drug mules. “For every one who’s a valedictorian there’s another 100 out there that — they weigh 130 pounds and they’ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they’re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert” the honorable gentleman said.Cantaloupe calves? This was a rotten tomato tossed at Latinos who were already suspicious of Republicans before the insult was added to the injury of House conservatives such as King blocking action on bipartisan immigration legislation.“Hateful” said House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio).“Inexcusable” said Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.).1 of 171 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Republicans View Photos A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Caption A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Tom Toles Wait 1 second to continue.King kept on throwing. “It’s not something that I’m making up” he told Radio Iowa on Tuesday evening hours after a Democrat who had discovered the recent interview with Newsmax read the offending comments aloud at a congressional hearing. “We have people that are mules that are drug mules that are hauling drugs across the border and you can tell by their physical characteristics what they’ve been doing for months going through the desert with 75 pounds of drugs on their back. And if those who advocate for the DREAM Act if they choose to characterize this about valedictorians I gave them a different image.”King certainly gave his colleagues a different image: that of a Republican Party driven into extinction in coming decades because it antagonized what is becoming the most important voting bloc. Even his usual conservative partners moved to isolate him.“Irresponsible and reprehensible” Rep. Raul Labrador (Idaho) said at a luncheon gathering with reporters called Conversations with Conservatives. “I think what he said was out of touch with the [GOP] conference.”In lieu of a defense of King Labrador scolded the assembled journalists for their reporting on King’s out-of-his-gourd remark but not the favorable things other Republicans say about immigrants. “Shame on you. Shame on the media” he lectured. “Make sure that your article talks about what every Republican said” Labrador proposed “not what one outlier said.”This is similar to scolding the media for focusing on the one plane that crashes and not giving equal attention to all the planes that land safely. More to the point it’s not at all clear that King is such an outlier.Certainly his zany remarks are low-hanging fruit for journalists. Just last week he got into a heated exchange with a Univision host who asked about a speech in which King likened immigrants to a litter of puppies. “You want a good bird dog?” he asked. “Pick the one that’s the friskiest. . . . You get the pick of the litter and you got yourself a pretty good bird dog. Well we’ve got the pick of every donor civilization on the planet.”But if Republicans think King is a fruitcake they don’t show it on the House floor where last month they approved along party lines an amendment King offered that would force the Obama administration to resume deportation of the DREAMers who immigrated as children. “If this position holds no amnesty will reach the president’s desk” the congressman said in a celebratory statement after the vote.1 of 171 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Republicans View Photos A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Caption A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Tom Toles Wait 1 second to continue.And King’s position is holding. Boehner responding to House conservatives is refusing to take up the Senate legislation. Because he has chosen a strategy of passing legislation through the House without Democratic votes the speaker can’t afford to lose more than a handful of Republicans. This empowers “outliers” such as King.“The reason we’re in a bottleneck here in Congress is because of a few like him” Rep. Rubén Hinojosa (D-Tex.) chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus told me Wednesday afternoon at a caucus event outside the Capitol. “Evidently there’s enough to be able to force the speaker of the House to stall and not be able to do this immigration reform.”Republicans say their objections to the immigration bill have nothing to do with racial or ethnic discrimination and that’s surely the case for most of them. But King makes it easy for Democrats to tar the Republicans with sinister motives. Rep. Ben Luján (D-N.M.) one of several speakers denouncing King on the House floor Wednesday said his slur shows why “the American people continue to see House Republicans as out of touch.”That’s not quite fair. But when one of their own is talking about cantaloupe calves Republicans aren’t in a strong position to complain about cherry-picking.Twitter: @MilbankRead more from Dana Milbank’s archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.,0
22,WASHINGTON — President Obama expanding his push to curtail severe penalties in drug cases on Thursday commuted the sentences of eight federal inmates who were convicted of crack cocaine offenses. Each inmate has been imprisoned for at least 15 years and six were sentenced to life in prison.It was the first time retroactive relief was provided to a group of inmates who would most likely have received significantly shorter terms if they had been sentenced under current drug laws sentencing rules and charging policies. Most will be released in 120 days. The commutations opened a major new front in the administration’s efforts to curb soaring taxpayer spending on prisons and to help correct what it has portrayed as inequality in the justice system.In a statement Mr. Obama said that each of the eight men and women had been sentenced under what is now recognized as an “unfair system” including a 100-to-1 sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine offenses that was significantly reduced by the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010.“If they had been sentenced under the current law many of them would have already served their time and paid their debt to society” Mr. Obama said. “Instead because of a disparity in the law that is now recognized as unjust they remain in prison separated from their families and their communities at a cost of millions of taxpayer dollars each year.”,0
23,During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Friday Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) a member of the bipartisan “Gang of Eight” urged his Senate colleagues and members of the media at the immigration bill hearing to not tie the bill to the Boston terror attack bombings. After he made the request he proceeded to do exactly what he asked others to not do.“Before I get to the bill I’d like to ask that all of us not jump to conclusions regarding the events in Boston or try to conflate those events with this legislation” Schumer said.But after Schumer made that plea he commented on immigration reform including the specific Gang of 8 bill in the context of the Boston terror attacks.“In general we are a safer country when law enforcement knows who is here has their fingerprints photos et cetera background checks” Schumer said.“In addition both the refugee program and asylum program have been strengthened in the past five years such that we are much more careful about screening people in terms of who should and should not be coming into the country” Schumer added. “If there are any changes that our homeland security experts tell us need to be made I’m committed to making them.”Schumer’s comments came after the committee’s Ranking GOP Member Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) mentioned the Boston bombing earlier in the hearing. Schumer’s chastisement of his colleagues about mentioning the Boston attack appeared to be a response to Grassley.“We also appreciate the opportunity to talk about immigration particularly in light of all that’s happening in Massachusetts right now and over the last week” Grassley said to open the hearing. “We are here trying to understand why these events have occurred. It’s hard to understand that there are people in this world that want to do Americans harm so this hearing is an opportunity to refocus on the issues at hand and the importance of remaining vigilant and secure in our homeland.”,1
24,"Jake GrovumPew/Stateline Staff WriterSome states are already embracing deep cuts to the food stamp program similar to those passed by House Republicans in Washington ending the food subsidy for tens of thousands of low-income Americans regardless of what Congress does.Spurred by the ballooning cost of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program the GOP-dominated House voted Thursday 217-210 to cut $39 billion in the food assistance program over 10 years. Among the changes: Ending waivers for states that during the recession allowed as many as 4 million people to collect food stamps who otherwise would not have qualified.The fate of the congressional legislation is uncertain. The Senate approved much smaller reductions and the White House threatened to veto any large cuts to food stamps.But in six states—Delaware Kansas New Hampshire Utah Vermont and Wyoming—similar reductions are already in place or soon will be. Two more states will join them once their waivers expire potentially taking away food stamps from tens of thousands of current recipients.Republicans blame the program's ever-increasing rolls and cost on lax enrollment criteria rather than real need. Since before the recession the price tag for food stamps has more than doubled topping $82.5 billion in fiscal year 2013. Enrollment hit record highs with 15 percent of Americans now collecting benefits. Many states have more than 20 percent of their population enrolled.Costs have continued to spike as well as Washington pays for the benefits and states administer them. A new Congressional Research Service report released this month showed fiscal year 2012 was the 12th year in a row a new historical high was reached for federal food and nutrition programs the vast majority of which is food stamps. Since fiscal year 2000 the report said spending on federal food assistance has more than tripled.Put in a different context the U.S. Census Bureau said food stamps lifted 4 million Americans out of poverty last year if the benefits were counted as income.What states are doingKansas is the latest to embrace the cuts ending a federal waiver on Oct. 1 that allows unemployed non-elderly and able-bodied adults without children to remain on food stamps despite failing to meet certain work requirements. The change is expected to affect 20000 Kansans. Wisconsin will let its waiver expire in July 2014 and Oklahoma will also let its waiver at the end of this month; 71000 and 47000 people respectively received benefits through the waiver in 2011 the latest year for which data is available.The waivers part of the 1996 welfare reform were designed to give states flexibility in times of high unemployment. It suspends a requirement that limits benefits to three months unless recipients work 20 hours a week or spend a certain amount of time on work-related activities such as job training.Until this year 45 states took advantage of the waiver during the recession and two that did not – Vermont and New Hampshire – weren't eligible for statewide coverage which is based on unemployment and job market data. Delaware and Utah chose not to request a waiver while Wyoming wasn't eligible.Many Republican-led states are trimming safety nets as the recession wanes. In addition food stamp benefits for all recipients are set to fall Nov. 1 when federal stimulus money ends. Some states have changed welfare enrollment criteria. Others enacted unprecedented cuts in unemployment insurance as Stateline previously reported.Against that backdrop supporters of the cuts see the work requirement as a prime opportunity to trim the rolls. Those possibly affected by ending the waivers comprise less than 5 percent of Americans collecting food stamps.Republicans see the improving economy as a sign enrollment should be dropping anyway with cuts to benefits a good way to push some people back into the labor market. Kansas made its case clear calling the policy ""an effort to encourage employment over welfare dependency.""""Employment is the most effective way to escape poverty"" Kansas Department of Children and Families Secretary Phyllis Gilmore said in a statement announcing the move.Those who support ending the waivers also promise robust job placement and training programs to help those affected meet work requirements which could allow them to keep their benefits. Wisconsin for example is spending an additional $33 million on those efforts as its waiver expires.Are cuts premature?Others say the cuts are premature in the face of a weak job market— 11 states and the District of Columbia have unemployment rates measurably higher than the national 7.3 percent jobless rate. The waivers are designed to end once employment improves. Ending them sooner could strip flexibility to deal with lingering joblessness which is expected to remain above normal for years.""It's hard to imagine any state would want to lose the flexibility to use waivers to tailor the policy to meet local conditions"" said Dottie Rosenbaum a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities a left-leaning think tank. Rosenbaum added that the work-requirement policy can have ""harsh effects on very poor individuals.""Underlying the debate is the question of whether policies enacted during the recession have increased enrollment levels beyond actual need. Critics cite the outsized growth of food stamps compared with other safety net programs during the recession.Projections paint a bleak picture. The Congressional Budget Office estimates more than 43 million will collect food stamp benefits in 2017 just 4 million fewer than today. By 2022 the CBO estimates enrollment will be 9 million more than pre-recession levels and total spending will be nearly $73 billion—more than double than it was in 2007.Stateline is a nonpartisan nonprofit news service of the Pew Charitable Trusts that provides daily reporting and analysis on trends in state policy.",1
25,Along with — and because of — dramatic social and demographic changes America is quickly dividing itself into two separate nations regional enclaves of rigid politics as the idea of common national priorities fades further into a distant past.Rich Morin a senior editor at the Pew Research Center wrote about a new study on public opinion on Wednesday and found that:“Americans often say they want their representatives in Congress to put the country’s needs over local concerns. But four novel experiments suggest that the public does just the opposite.”He continued:“Respondents rated a member of Congress far more favorably if the lawmaker put the interests of his or her district or state over those of the country as a whole.”He concluded in part with this damning line:“The study’s author says legislators who ‘nobly’ put national preferences ahead of local ones will be punished by constituents.”,0
26,"Glenn Harlan ReynoldsEmails demonstrate that the targeting of Tea Party groups was orchestrated from the top.The IRS shared information with the FEC%2C raising questions about how politicized both agencies were.A poll shows that fewer Americans than ever trust the federal government.With all the excitement over Syria last week -- we went from ""Assad is Hitler"" to ""we have achieved peace in our time"" almost overnight! -- you may have missed another big story. The IRS scandal which has slumbered over the summer as Congress has been in recess seems to be waking up.It has now been over four months since the IRS admitted it was targeting conservative groups in the run-up to the 2012 election. The chief IRS official in charge of Exempt Organizations Lois Lerner has ""taken the Fifth"" -- invoking her right against self-incrimination in order to avoid testifying before Congress on what went on. Nonetheless President Obama -- who himself ""joked"" about auditing his enemies -- has lumped the IRS misconduct in with what he calls ""phony scandals.""But new emails have come out that make the IRS scandal look anything but phony. Emails recovered by the House Ways and Means Committee demonstrate that the targeting of Tea Party groups -- and of voter-integrity groups -- was orchestrated from the top of the agency. Rather than being conducted by a few rogue employees in the Cincinnati office of the IRS the Tea Party targeting was regarded by Lerner as something ""very dangerous"" politically and she observed that ""Cincy should probably NOT have these cases.""The emails also reveal Lerner's concerns that the Democrats might lose their Senate majority and her hopes that the Federal Election Commission might ""save the day"" by interfering with right-leaning grassroots activity. The IRS also shared information with the FEC something not permitted by statute raising questions about just how politicized both agencies were.An editorial in Investor's Business Dailyobserves:""Like the Internet video the Benghazi terrorist attack was blamed on the only thing phony about the IRS scandal is the administration's cover story that a couple of rogue agents in the Cincinnati office concocted and executed this most blatant abuse of power by the most powerful and feared agency of government. Lerner's email further blows out of the water that discredited fiction. It also confirms a suspected reason for the planned intimidation and hamstringing of conservative opposition to the Obama administration's policies saying that those Tea Party group applications for tax-exempt status could end up being the 'vehicle to go to court' to get more clarity on the 2010 Supreme Court ruling on campaign finance rules.""That's right and that's just another reason why we need to get to the bottom of the IRS scandal which isn't the least bit ""phony."" It seems to me that there are two possible problems here. One is that this came from the Obama White House. The other is that the -- overwhelmingly Democratic -- career civil service at the IRS didn't need White House instructions to go after Tea Party groups it saw as enemies.The first possibility is bad enough but is presumably remediable with stricter rules. The second possibility however calls into question the possibility of a nonpartisan career civil service and certainly the possibility of fair administration for something as complex and involving as many discretionary decisions as the Internal Revenue Code. Worse yet given that overwhelming partisan identification with Democrats pervades the civil service as a whole it calls into question the very possibility of a nonpartisan and politically neutral civil service.I'm not ready to call for a return to the ""spoils system"" but the fully politicized federal bureaucracy of our nation's first century or so did have two advantages: First presidents couldn't hide behind the bureaucracy as they were presumed responsible for the actions of government bureaus staffed with their supporters; and second politicians were less inclined to trust the bureaucracy with enormous and discretionary power when they knew that it would sometimes be staffed by their political adversaries.At any rate it all boils down to trust. One reason for the resonance of not only the IRS scandals but also the NSA scandal the Benghazi scandal Fast and Furious and so on is that fewer Americans than ever trust the federal government. It's a mess that needs to be cleaned up and denying that the mess exists only exacerbates the lack of trust.It's doubtful that Eric Holder's Justice Department -- which is even more partisan and politicized than the IRS -- will clean this mess up. Nor is Holder likely to appoint a special prosecutor. So it's up to congressional investigators to get to the bottom of it.

27,Bill Maher’s New Rules on the plea to raise the minimum wage is on point. It is hard to understand anyone’s objection to it. A country cannot frown on citizen’s using public assistance if it does not create an economy that pays a living wage to all its citizens that are working.The following snippet with the most relevant bullets from his New Rules segment on the minimum wage is on point.Bill Maher’s New Rules Snippet On The Minimum Wage When it comes to raising the minimum wage Conservatives always say it is a non-starter because it cuts into profits. … You might think that paying people enough to live is so self-evident that even crazy people could understand it. But you would be wrong. … Michele Bachmann is not only against raising the minimum wage she is against having one at all. She wants said “… if we took away the minimum wage … we could … virtually wipe out unemployment … because we would be able to offer jobs at whatever level.” … And naturally Ted Cruz agrees. Ted Cruz thinks it’s a good thing that when his Cuban father came to America he was paid fifty cents an hour to work as a dishwasher. … When did the American dream become this pathway to indentured servitude this economic death spiral where workers get paid next to nothing so they can only afford to buy next to nothing so businesses are forced to sell cheaper and cheaper shit? Consider the fact that most fast food workers whose average age by the way is 29 … are on some form of public assistance which is not surprising. When even working people can’t make enough to live they take money from the government. This is the question the Right has to answer. Do you want smaller government with less handouts or do you want do you want a low minimum wage because you cannot have both. If Coronel Sanders isn’t going to pay the lady behind the counter enough to live on then Uncle Sam has to. And I for one is getting a little tired of helping highly profitable companies pay their workers.Bill Maher makes a very important statement. The average American citizens are subsidizing McDonald’s. Americans are subsidizing all companies that are paying below subsistence level wages.The viral story of a McDonald’s employee calling a McDonald’s help line is probative. McDonald’s gave her information necessary to get government assistance and charity. This was a full time worker. What she really needs is an increase in the minimum wage. What she needs is the dignity of pay she can live on.Bill Maher is late to the party. George Carlin figured out long time ago that the American Dream had become a pathway to indentured servitude. He laid it out in his “The American Dream” standup skit. The minimum wage is part of the problem. However the problem of the poor and working middle class is much deeper.The problem is income and wealth disparity that is getting worse. Income and growth is extracted from the poor and the middle class with policies to ensure the incessant steady growth of the wealth and income of a very few.LIKE My Facebook Page – Visit My Blog: EgbertoWillies.comFollow @EgbertoWillies,0
28,Leaders hope to finalize work by the end of the week on the bill which is needed to keep the government operating past the March 27 expiration of a stopgap law that has been funding the government since last October. The House may accept the Senate bill rather than go into a conference to resolve the differences.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementFederal salary rates have not been increased since January 2010 although if eligible employees may continue to receive raises for performance on promotion or on successfully completing a waiting period in grade-and-step-type pay systems. The extension of the freeze also would apply to members of Congress and top political appointees.Both versions of the “continuing resolution” leave in place the sequestration cuts that took effect March 1 and that have threatened furloughs in many agencies. Each would allow certain new flexibilities in how agencies can achieve the required savings the Senate bill to a greater extent than the House bill. However those changes likely won’t lift the threat of furloughs.Announced plans vary widely with some agencies saying they won’t need to require employees to take unpaid days off while others have projected furloughs ranging from several days to 22 days. Where furloughs are planned timing also differs. Several agencies including the largest the Defense Department expect to start the week of April 21 while some don’t expect to begin until later.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAlso Tuesday the House is taking up a budget plan for the upcoming fiscal year which would require federal employees to increase their contributions toward their retirement benefits by about 5.5 percentage points. The bill also would seek a cut in the workforce of 10 percent by attrition over two years.Many federal agencies already have imposed general hiring freezes due to sequestration.The House expects to vote Wednesday on several alternative budgets including one sponsored by the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee Rep. Chris Van Hollen (Md.). That plan would not require higher retirement contributions or a workforce cut while proposing to replace sequestration with spending cuts in defense and certain domestic programs reductions in agriculture subsidies and reduced tax breaks for the wealthy.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementHowever an alternative from the Republican Study Group a caucus of House conservatives would raise employee retirement contributions and calls for limiting the “size and scope of government” — although it does not specify a workforce reduction goal. It also would change the health insurance premium sharing formula to a voucher system base retiree inflation adjustments on a less generous measure and end the practice of “official time” in which federal employees who serve as union officials can conduct certain union business during working hours.After finishing its work on the temporary funding bill the Senate is set to turn to its counterpart budget resolution that does not seek a reduction in the federal workforce nor an increase in retirement contributions. One provision of special interest to federal workers added in committee voting by Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) would allow shifting of funds within the Office of Personnel Management to support efforts to reduce the backlog of federal retirement applications pending there.,1
29,"My connection to her comes from the darkest days of Occupy Wall Street when activists were being arrested and brutalized the city was engaged in illegal shenanigans to harass folks at Zuccotti Park and even Netroots New York was nearly cancelled because of our association with occupiers. As a leader in the National Lawyers Guild Kurland was tireless in defending the civil and political rights of New Yorkers and earned a respect in all the circles she traveled in - labor lgbt civil rights healthcare neighborhood activists and the legal community.Two communities she failed to impress include real estate and Wall St. So no one was surprised with Corey Johnson a hollow candidate if there ever was one entered the race with Christine Quinn's blessing. Reading his resume you might be impressed with his public track record of activism. One thing stands out though: no mention of how he earns a living.It's easy to understand why. As CityCouncilWatch.net reports""What it turns out he is covering up and scrubbing from his Internet presence is his work as Director of Governmental Relations and Community Affairs for GFI Development Company beginning in July 2008. GFI Development is the real estate development branch of GFI Group which according to the company website “has been at the forefront of credit derivative brokerage services leadership that we are now leveraging to help establish an active liquid Exotic Credit Derivative market.” Exotic credit derivatives for those among us with short memories are those quaint financial instruments that enable banks to make massive bets on the failure of loans without having to actually own any of the underlying debt. Credit derivatives caused a minor kerfuffle in the markets in late 2008. GFI Group “handled as much as 40 percent of the credit-derivatives trades between the world's banks in 2007” according to Bloomberg. Well Corey Johnson had nothing to do with any of that of course…he worked for the real estate development arm of GFI. And real estate development firms are wholesome salubrious entities. Which must be why after I asked Johnson’s campaign manger about his work there his speaker bio at the Gay Center website was scrubbed. (Compare here and here.) And his LinkedIn profile was closed.To recap not only is Kurland a fantastic candidate worthy of our support but she's running against the recession era caricature of pure unadulterated evil: a real estate lobbyist in Manhattan working for the leader in the 'exotic derivatives' industry. A starker choice could not be made.Visit Yetta Kurland for Council.Full disclosure: I don't live in Kurland's district but I love her.

30,In the public relations push for his takeover of the American health care system President Obama promised that those who like their insurance could keep it premiums would decrease and no one would lose their doctor. We know now those were all lies told repeatedly and never questioned by a media that is still looking the other way. Another promise Obama made was that ObamaCare would not fund abortions. LifeNews reports that this was also a lie:The ObamaCare statute specifically requires the issuers of Exchange plans that cover abortion to “collect from each enrollee in the plan” a “separate payment” for the type of abortions for which funding is prohibited under the Hyde Amendment (which is all abortions other than in cases of life of the mother rape or incest) and a separate payment for all other services. [42 U.S.C. 18023(b)]. These separate payments are then to be deposited into separate accounts.During the regulatory process commenters questioned HHS on how this was to be implemented and according to HHS the commenters “recommended that HHS clarify . . . whether [Exchange plan] issuers may satisfy the separate payment provision by providing each enrollee with an itemized bill and whether an enrollee’s coverage would be terminated for failure to comply with the separate payment provision.” Rather than doing so HHS merely said that the comments would be taken into consideration in any future guidance. [77 Fed. Reg. 18430 (March 27 2012)].Now despite the clear language of the ObamaCare statute it appears that the separate check requirement is not going to be enforced by the Obama Administration. Gretchen Borchelt director of state reproductive health policy at the National Women’s Law Center told the Huffington Post that “we used to talk about it as being two checks that the consumer would have to write because of the segregation requirements but that’s not the way it’s being implemented.” (Huffington Post Sept. 3 2013).Likewise a spokeswoman for Rhode Island’s Exchange told PolitiFact Rhode Island that “the customer is not billed a separate fee.” (Politifact Oct. 2 2013. The Rhode Island Exchange will handle the billing not the plan issuers). As PolitiFact notes “it turns out to be a hidden fee.”There is nothing the media is willing to make Obama pay a political price for. Not even repeatedly lying to millions who are about to lose their insurance or forcing people to violate their conscience over the abomination of abortion.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC,0
31,"WASHINGTON -- The end of the year brings with it one of journalism's lazier crutches -- the annual list of winners and losers.Whatever value there is in judging a politician's standings in late December it's limited. In today's hyper-kinetic Washington politics conventional wisdom changes -- and quickly. And yet in talking with operatives Capitol Hill aides Washington observers and others one impression is more permanent than any other: President Barack Obama had a really bad tough-to-spin 2013.It was as conceded by David Axelrod the president's longtime adviser a ""crappy year.""It's not just the poor rollout of the Affordable Care Act. To review: Obama worked Congress hard on gun control measures. It failed. He was hands-off with Congress on immigration reform. It failed. He pushed to avert sequestration cuts. They were enacted. He argued for unemployment benefits to be extended. They weren't. Revelations of aggressive investigations into national security leaks led to a review of Justice Department activities. Revelations that the IRS had screened tea party groups led to a reworking of the tax agency's practices. Revelations of the National Security Agency's broad surveillance programs endorsed by Obama led to popular revulsion a court rebuke another review and likely reforms.That a government shutdown gave the president one of his better moments says something about the year. Shortly after the October standoff was resolved with polls showing a majority blamed Republicans the anti-Obama dam broke. The ACA rollout was a disaster and a signature promise of the program that Obama made himself was proven hollow.At his year-end press conference Friday Obama declined to call it the worst year of his presidency.""I have now been in office five years close to five years was running for president for two years before that and for those who've covered me during that time we have had ups and we have had downs"" he said. ""I think this room has probably recorded at least 15 near-death experiences.""As proof that his rumored demise may be premature Obama noted recent legislative activity and the prospect of a continued thaw. Obama's defenders meanwhile argued that some 2013 setbacks should be placed in context. The IRS ""scandal"" lost fizz when it became clear that the agency had screened progressive groups too. Sequestration relief was passed during the year-end budget deal. Even the stalled immigration reform effort has an upside.""We actually aren’t quite as gloomy about this year"" said Matt Bennett senior vice president for public affairs and a co-founder of the centrist-Democratic group Third Way. ""Yes the ACA rollout was very rocky. But if they get their act fully together on that he may be in for a more productive year in 2014 than many expect. He got a really good immigration bill out of the Senate and there is hope in the House once the primary filing deadlines pass. ... We actually made some headway on gun safety -- getting a vote on final passage and a handful of Republicans is nothing to sneeze at. So we see a few green shoots. Of course we don’t yet know if they are flowers or weeds.""But even when taking those green shoots into account it's impossible to argue that Obama has been on a course he's enjoyed. The charts don't lie.The more pertinent question (one whose answer has implications for the years ahead) is whether to blame personal missteps and mismanagement or unforeseen events and structural problems with the political system?For Axelrod the president and his team aren't entirely blameless. Part of the damage was ""self-inflicted"" including the ""atrocious rollout of the health care website"" he said. But broader issues outside of Obama's control were more determinative.""The fact is you start out wanting to talk about and work on one set of issues and then events drag you to other places"" Axelrod said pointing to the Newtown shootings and Syrian civil war as examples. ""That is really the story of this year. ... A lot of it has to do with random events and orchestrated subversion on the part of the opposition.""Certainly there were moments during the year when the president was forced off of his agenda. White House officials had planned a big jobs-related legislative push in January for example before the docket was overwhelmed by gun control. Other Democrats argued that the kinks of the political system did Obama in with Republicans rewarded above all else for obstinacy.""No White House is perfect and everyone makes mistakes but I do think the structural problems overwhelmed everything else because it just became apparent that nothing could happen"" said Bennett. ""The degree of dysfunction was historic. ... He could have been Lincoln in 1863 and he wouldn't have been able to do anything.""But Republican obstruction isn't exactly new. Nor is the notion that the news cycle is unwieldy and difficult to control. Other Democrats were sympathetic to the president but more inclined to say that Obama and his team were responsible for the mess.Mike Lux who served as Obama's liaison to the progressive community during the 2008 White House transition and has been critical of the administration since argued that self-assuredness played a damaging role preventing Obama and his team from seeing problems on the horizon. When would-be allies warned the White House about the looming dangers of health care insurance cancelations or the potential backlash to a Larry Summers Federal Reserve nomination the advice was heard but not necessarily heeded.""I feel like the White House goes it alone too much"" said Lux. ""In advance of a battle or even in the early stages of a problem it doesn't seem like they have gone out of their way to build unity and cohesion in the party and with progressive allies.""A top progressive operative put it more bluntly: ""These guys are stunningly arrogant. They really believe that their shit doesn't smell that they have all the answers. And that arrogance continues to hurt them.""As for policy insularity has become the enemy of originality Lux argued. That's led to an administration too comfortable with conventional wisdom. The president didn't challenge the intelligence community over the surveillance programs and he made back room deals that complicated the health care law unnecessarily.What's ironic others said is that Obama is more comfortable as president now than at any point since he was elected. Drew Westen a professor at Emory University famously criticized Obama in 2011 on the op-ed pages of The New York Times for acquiescing too much to his opponents and for uninspiring oratory.Today Westen praises Obama for increasingly relying on executive actions. If he were to grade Obama he said he'd give him higher marks than ""in all his prior years."" Where Obama's administration has been tripped up he argued has been in a failure to elevate issues and messages that matter.""There were people like me who at the end of 2009 were saying 'You have got to start messaging in a coherent way about not only health care but about what you are going to do about jobs and reigning in the power of banks protecting consumers against predatory lending and credit practices that the average person was furious about'"" said Westen ""That stuff was all clearly predictable by the end of 2009. Where I would fault him now is that I think he is doing the same thing again before this midterm election.""A request for comment from the White House was not returned. But it seems clear already that Obama and his team see value in Westen's point. In recent weeks the administration has begun focusing on income inequality wage stagnation and the need to spur job growth. Aides stressed that one of the first orders of business in 2014 will be getting unemployment insurance renewed.""The core issue of the 2012 campaign was strengthening economic security for the middle class"" said one former White House official. ""The question is whether putting every other issue on the back burner and focusing on that out of the gate would have changed the outcomes. My answer: maybe not significantly but somewhat.""And then there is the Occam's razor view of what went wrong. Had the Affordable Care Act's rollout not been so badly botched the year-end retrospective would have been kinder.Howard Dean the former Democratic National Committee chairman and Vermont governor argued as much when asked for his assessment. Every president who wins a second term suffers setbacks during his fifth year in office Dean noted. And in all cases the problems confronting Obama had to do either with a policy that he pushed or a personal decision that he made.""It wasn't a policy issue it was a digital problem"" Dean said. ""He is in trouble because of the website.""And for that reason there is hope for a bounce in 2014.""I would argue that if he didn't have the website collapse he wouldn't be subjected to the five-year curse as much"" said Dean. ""All the other five-year curses were of the sitting president's own making. This one you may argue that three people down the line screwed up the website not Obama. ... I do not think that he has been personally stained the way the other presidents were.""",1
32,"Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions is accusing the Obama administration of failing to enforce a century-old law meant to prevent immigrants from taking root in the U.S. only to live on the government dole -- after the administration reported it did not cite anyone for this last year.""Virtually no one one is being examined before they enter the country on whether or not they'll ... immediately begin to depend on government welfare"" Sessions R-Ala. top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee told Fox News.As Congress weighs new immigration legislation Sessions said any reform package ""has got to end that.""Sessions turned up new statistics from the Department of Homeland Security last week showing what he describes as a startling trend. DHS reported how relatively few immigrants are being turned away on the grounds that they are likely to become a ""public charge"" -- or individuals who depend on welfare programs -- despite a 100-year-old law that's supposed to prevent this.The department blaming ""data entry quality"" said it did not have complete information on how many immigrants became public charges. But the department did a case-by-case review for the bulk of fiscal 2012 and found just one where that claim was leveled at an immigrant. ""However the charge was later withdrawn"" DHS reported.Further the department reported that just a tiny fraction of people are rejected on these grounds when seeking entry under a program that allows admission for 90 days for travelers from certain countries. Between fiscal 2005 and most of fiscal 2012 a total of 9796 were denied -- a fraction of a percent of those admitted. State Department figures for visa applications showed a similar trend with just .068 percent of visa applications denied on those grounds in fiscal 2011.Sessions has been hammering this issue for months. He and other Republican senators earlier wrote to the departments of Homeland Security and State arguing that a bedrock principle of immigration law is that ""those who seek citizenship in this country ought to be financially self-sufficient.""The senator suggests the immigration system has produced a lopsided result in which high-skill immigrants are turned away while those who end up absorbing more taxpayer dollars than they contribute stay.Recent studies show welfare spending on immigrant-headed households is relatively high. A Center for Immigration Studies report found that 36 percent of these households were using ""at least one major welfare program"" in 2010 -- compared with 23 percent of other households.Sessions' office says the number of non-citizens on food stamps has skyrocketed in recent years. And the conservative Heritage Foundation claims low-skill immigrant households take in roughly $20000 more in government benefits every year than they pay in taxes.Sessions suggests the government is fueling this trend. He earlier made a stink over long-running U.S. Department of Agriculture radio ""novelas"" that depicted people being pressured into going on food stamps. The ads were later discontinued. The senator also is drawing attention to the WelcomeToUSA.gov site that provides information on a host of taxpayer assistance programs for immigrants including Medicare food stamps Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and others.",1
33,"I promised one graph - but lets look at one more. Let's compare labor's share of income to the S&P 500 since 2000.Two things to note - the stock market is going up while labor's share is going down. I don't think is a a real surprise but the graph shows the cause pretty well. But there is a second point I want to make as well. In addition to a lack of demand a world where the rich have too much money is a world that is going to be subject to asset bubbles. If the rich don't spend their money it is going to go somewhere. That somewhere is in part various financial markets. But because financial markets are prone to panic I think you can predict that we will see more bubbles build and then burst.The graph suggests at least in part that my second point is true is well.There are many conclusions you can draw on this. Some here will say that this is a house of cards that will all come crashing down. I don't think this is really right for a variety of reasons. But I DO think that until something happens to change the balance of power between labor and capital the economy will not perform as it could and the fruits of that economy will be very unequally distributed.I close with Marriner Eccles' (the head of the Fed under FDR) famous explanation of the cause of the Great Depression. His words ring true today:As mass production has to be accompanied by mass consumption mass consumption in turn implies a distribution of wealth -- not of existing wealth but of wealth as it is currently produced -- to provide men with buying power equal to the amount of goods and services offered by the nation's economic machinery. [Emphasis in original.] Instead of achieving that kind of distribution a giant suction pump had by 1929-30 drawn into a few hands an increasing portion of currently produced wealth. This served them as capital accumulations. But by taking purchasing power out of the hands of mass consumers the savers denied to themselves the kind of effective demand for their products that would justify a reinvestment of their capital accumulations in new plants. In consequence as in a poker game where the chips were concentrated in fewer and fewer hands the other fellows could stay in the game only by borrowing. When their credit ran out the game stopped.Since this is on the reclist I thought I would point people to a very wonkish - but still important piece by Brad Delong this morning. Delong is pretty much required reading if you want to understand the economy - he was one of the leaders of the attacks on Reinhart and Rogoff.He notes in part about the incredible gap between corporate profits and the Treasury rate:""Right now the profit share in the US economy is at levels far and away higher than I at least ever imagined I would see. And given the high profit share and the extremely low return on Treasury notes the stock market is far and away lower than I at least ever imagined I would see. With downward pressure on real wages from elevated unemployment making it more likely that profits will grow faster than the economy rather than shrink the 9% point gap between the S&P earnings yield of 7% and the Treasury note real yield of -2%--I never thought I would see anything like this in my lifetime.""",0
34,"Revisions are where we get that better information. They're the most accurate part of the unemployment numbers. And in this latest jobs report they're a huge disappointment: ""The change in total nonfarm payroll employment for June was revised from +188000 to +172000 and the change for July was revised from +162000 to +104000."" That means we added 74000 fewer jobs than we thought in June and July.2) The unemployment rate dropped for the worst reason. Unemployment dropped to 7.3 percent in August. Huzzah? Sorry but no.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThere are two reasons the unemployment rate dropped. One is that people get jobs. Huzzah! The other is that people stop looking for jobs and so they're no longer counted as technically unemployed. That's what happened here. The number show 312000 people dropping out of the labor force. That'll be revised but if the truth is anywhere close it's horrible.3) Job creation was terrible. I know I said initial jobs reports are often misleading. And August jobs reports in particular have tended to see sharp upward revisions in recent years. But still this report was a bummer: 169000 jobs added. Plug that into the Hamilton Project's handy-dandy jobs gap calculator and you'll find that this hiring pace will close the jobs gap sometime in 2023:4) Unemployment among teenagers African Americans and Hispanics remains insane. Among teenagers the unemployment rate is 22.7 percent; for African Americans it's 13 percent; for Hispanics 9.3 percent. And remember those numbers only count people actively looking for work. Many others would like to work but have stopped hunting for a job. In these communities then the job market is somewhere between an awful recession and a severe depression.",1
35,"City officials in this San Francisco suburb passed an ordinance this past week prohibiting city contractors from ever inquiring about many job applicants' criminal histories.The move in this city of 100000 people which is troubled by crime and high unemployment is part of a growing national trend that supporters say is designed to improve the community's employment prospects amid wider incarceration.[pullquote]Under the ordinance approved by the City Council in a 6-1 vote and set to take effect in September private companies that have city contracts and that employ more than nine people won't be able to ask anything about an applicant's criminal record; otherwise they would lose their city contracts.

He now works for an advocacy group called Safe Return that campaigned for the ordinance.Others say the laws potentially endanger both employers and the public.

Last year Newark N.J. barred private employers and the city government from inquiring into a job applicant's criminal history until they have made a conditional offer of employment and employers can only take into consideration certain offenses committed within the past five to eight years.Murder voluntary manslaughter and sex offenses requiring registry can be inquired about no matter how much time has passed.Ten states also have enacted ban-the-box legislation according to the National Employment Law Project a nonprofit group that advocates for the laws. Many of those laws don't apply to job applications for ""sensitive"" positions such as those involving work with children.Michelle Rodriguez a NELP staff attorney said tougher sentencing laws in recent decades particularly for drug crimes have sent more people to prison making post-incarceration unemployment a broader problem. ""It really could be anybody who has a criminal record now—your co-worker your neighbor"" Ms. Rodriguez said. ""And it doesn't mean they're a criminal. It means they had a run-in with the law.""Click for more from WSJ.com",0

It passed in a 62-36 vote in the Senate Monday eveningSteve Benen did a little math with these votes. In the Housevoted against emergency aid. In the Senate those 36 votes represent. The overwhelming majority of Republicans well more than three-quarters now approach natural disasters as political fodder another opportunity to push deficit hysteria and to force massive cuts to other domestic spending. Tax cuts to the wealthy? Those pay for themselves. Rebuilding destroyed communities populated by millions of Americans? Only if you cut other government programs. In other words the vast majority of Republicans are assholes.But the king of the assholes at least on this vote is Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt number three on that list up there of votes against Sandy relief. Let's rewind to May 2011.ST. LOUIS (KMOX) - Missouri Senator Roy Blunt says he’s asking the federal government to reimburse 100 percent of the cost to local governments dealing with the Joplin tornado aftermath. [...] “I’m asking for 100 percent federal reimbursement to local governments” Blunt said “They’ve agreed to 75. I think they have to come to a better number than that and the right number I think would be 100 percent.”Note what's not included in that demand: offsets.,0

38,"The new system will rely more heavily on ""photo-matching."" The E-Verify system will contain a vast database of photographs and workers applying for jobs would need to present identification with photographs that match those in the database to prove they are who they say they are and that they are in the country legally.For non-citizens that would mean showing a work authorization or green card with a photo. Citizens could show passports or driver's licenses where states have agreed to provide license information to the E-Verify system. To encourage states to turn over the information he bill includes $250 million in new funding to reimburse states that choose to take part.Photo-matching is less expensive for employers — and potentially less invasive-feeling for workers — than finger-printing which had been considered by senators during their extensive negotiations.Still the process already has its critics which say it amounts to the creation of a new national ID.""If you take a step back and think about what that means when this reaches fruition and is completed you'll have an Internet-accessible system that has everyone’s photo and identifying information in it"" said Chris Calabrese legislative counsel with the ACLU. ""You can easily imagine E-Verify becoming the national ID system.""That the system will now be required for employers even small businesses that might have trouble shouldering the cost is also a concern he said. ""That's a fundamental shift"" he said from the current system which is largely voluntary.Jim Harper director of information studies at the Cato Institute said photographs are the weakest form of biometric identification. He predicted that a system that is launched using photos would later be expanded to include other identifiers people might see as more problematic including iris scans and fingerprints. But he said the ""knitting together"" of available sources of photographs into a single database is itself a concern.""I’m standing down on the horizon waving my arms saying  'Hey hey this is a national ID system!"" he said. ""It's big government at it's worst.""Still many immigration advocates have shelved their long-time opposition to E-Verify believing it one piece of a necessary compromise that will also allow a path to citizenship for those now in the country illegally. The system they believe is necessary to convince wary conservatives that the nation will not face a new flood of illegal immigrants once a path to citizenship is provided for many who are already here.Frank Sharry executive director of America's Voice said a new system to reduce incentives for employers to hire illegal immigrants — and make it harder for them to do so — is a key piece of any broad-based overhaul of the system.""It's the essential trade-off: legalization and a path to citizenship for employer verification"" he said. ""That is really the heart of every comprehensive immigration reform package ever put together.""",0
39,WASHINGTON — The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was conceived by a Harvard professor embraced by the Obama administration and pushed into law by Congressional Democrats determined to expand the federal government’s authority to protect borrowers from abusive lending practices — all in the space of just three years.But even after the agency opened its doors in July 2011 almost exactly two years ago its legal authority remained uncertain so long as Republicans prevented the confirmation of a director to lead the agency as required by law.That barricade collapsed on Tuesday. Republicans agreed to allow the confirmation of Richard Cordray by a vote of 66 to 34 cementing a new era of expansive federal oversight of companies that lend money to consumers.Senator Elizabeth Warren the Massachusetts Democrat who conceived the agency when she was a Harvard professor and supervised its creation as an Obama administration official presided over the 66-to-34 confirmation vote announcing the results with obvious satisfaction.,0
40,"8 years ago(CNN) – Food safety inspections early education classrooms and mental health treatment are all at risk if massive forced spending cuts are allowed to take effect at the end of this week the White House said Sunday.Those cuts would accompany deep reductions in defense spending - including stalling maintenance on Navy ships - that are also poised to trigger March 1.In detailed reports for all 50 states and the District of Columbia President Barack Obama's budget office spelled out how the cuts - which are the result of a stalemate between Congressional Republicans and the White House over reducing the federal deficit - will affect localities putting the stakes of the budget debate in stark terms as Congress returns to Washington after a week-long break.But some Republicans question whether the Obama administration is simply crafting a doomsday scenario for the indiscriminate cuts to force Congressional Republicans into accepting a deal that includes more tax increases for wealthy Americans which GOP leaders say is unacceptable. They would rather cut spending on entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security which they say are the real drivers of the country's debt.Nationwide the White House said 70000 children would no longer have access to Head Start early education programs and 10000 teacher jobs would be at risk consequences that Education Secretary Arne Duncan detailed Sunday.""It creates tremendous instability"" Duncan said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""And there are literally teachers now who are getting pink slips who are getting notices that they can't come back this fall.""Reduced federal funding for vaccines would mean children would go without shots that prevent measles mumps rubella tetanus whooping cough influenza and hepatitis B. The report indicated 2100 fewer food inspections would occur and medical research would be stalled.READ MORE: 'These cuts do not have to happen' Obama saysHundreds of thousands of ""seriously mentally ill adults and seriously emotionally disturbed children"" could go without treatment for their ailments according to the White House which could lead to higher rates of hospitalization and incarceration.And the Federal Aviation Administration would be forced to cut $600 million from its budget which the agency's boss said Sunday would result in furloughs - or forced leave - for nearly all of the FAA's 47000 employees.""We're going to try and cut as much as we possibly can out of contracts and other things that we do"" Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said. ""But in the end there has to be some kind of furlough of air traffic controllers and that will also begin to curtail or eliminate the opportunity for them to guide planes in and out of airports.""All told non-defense programs would be forced to reduce their spending by 9% the White House said while defense programs would have to cut 13%.Cuts to the military would include calling off maintenance on 11 ships in Norfolk Virginia home of the world's largest naval base. Air Force operations in the Commonwealth could be cut by $8 million. In San Diego maintenance on five ships would be canceled. In Jacksonville Florida funding to maintain an aircraft depot would disappear.The state-by-state analysis by the White House is a continuation of the administration's attempt to demonstrate in stark terms how the forced spending cuts would affect Americans - and to pin the blame on the GOP. That effort has been met with some skepticism from Republicans.""Rather than issuing last-minute press releases on cuts to first responders or troop training or airport security [Obama] should propose smarter ways to cut Washington spending. After all Washington spending even with the sequester is bigger than it was when he got here"" Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said in response to the White House's detailing of the cuts.“There are smarter ways to reduce the size of government. And with the national debt well over $16 trillion dollars it’s time for the White House to stop spending all its time campaigning and start finding smarter ways to reduce the deficit"" McConnell continued.Michael Steel a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner said ""The White House needs to spend less time explaining to the press how bad the sequester will be and more time actually working to stop it.""Some Republicans argue the White House is exaggerating how much Americans would feel the effects of the cuts.""The American people we see all these claims about what a tragedy it's going to be"" Republican Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma said on ""Fox News Sunday"" pointing to statements from LaHood and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano.""They have plenty of flexibility in terms of discretion on how they spend money"" Coburn said. ""There are easy ways to cut this money that the American people will never feel. What you hear is an outrage because nobody wants to cut spending.""Another Republican Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal called the dire warnings from Obama administration officials merely ""great political theater about how cutting less than 3% of the federal budget can cause all these awful consequences.""""Here is (Obama's) chance to say 'Here is how we can do it better.' The reality is the federal budget even after the cuts will be larger than last year's budget"" Jindal said on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""Dan Pfeiffer a senior adviser to the president denied that the White House was overstating the effects of the cuts saying that it's Obama's ""responsibility to make sure the American people understand what's at stake here in this debate.""""This is going to have a very real impact on people's lives and on communities and people need to know why that is"" Pfeiffer said. ""Are all these things going to go into effect on the first day? No. But there are hundreds of thousands of Americans who are working today who will lose their jobs as a consequence of this Republican decision.""",1

42,TUCSON — An Arizona law that put an end to ethnic studies courses in Tucson schools has been largely upheld as constitutional by a federal judge but supporters of the program say their legal fight to restore the program will continue.U.S. Circuit Court Judge Wallace Tashima on Friday found most of the law that bans public schools from teaching certain race-related courses such as Mexican American studies constitutional with one small exception. Tashima ruled that the portion of the law that prohibits courses designed for certain ethnic groups was unconstitutionally vague.AdvertisementTashima ruled that the provision’s wording was “broad and ambiguous” raising serious constitutional concerns that threaten “to chill the teaching of legitimate and objective ethnic studies courses.”Still Arizona Atty. Gen. Tom Horne this week called the ruling on HB 2281 a “victory for ensuring that public education is not held captive to radical political elements and that students treat each other as individuals — not on the basis of the race they were born into.”AdvertisementHorne who wrote the law and those who support it said the Mexican American Studies Program in the Tucson school system promoted resentment toward a race or a class of people and advocated ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of people as individuals.Defenders of the program rejected that characterization and said it taught often neglected aspects of U.S. history and inspired Latino students to excel in school.AdvertisementTrustees of the Tucson Unified School District discontinued the program in January 2012 after state officials determined the program violated the new law.The Save Ethnic Studies group based in Tucson declared the case “not over.” Richard Martinez an attorney who filed suit against the law acknowledged Tuesday that the legal road ahead would probably be long and steep.AdvertisementStill he said the group would forge ahead.“Too much is at stake. The right of every student to learn and teacher to teach the history literature and culture of Latinos in Arizona is currently prohibited” the group said in a statement Monday. “Mexican American Studies proved to be a valuable educational program.”AdvertisementIn his ruling Tashima stated that the arguments made against the law “do not meet the high threshold needed to establish a constitutional violation.”Although the judge said the program’s defenders failed to show discriminatory intent he found that several aspects of the law and the public debate about it “may be viewed to spark suspicion that the Latino population has been improperly targeted.”Advertisement“This single-minded focus on terminating the [Mexican American studies] program along with Horne’s decision not to issue findings against other ethnic studies programs is at least suggestive of discriminatory intent” Tashima wrote.Several students and teachers in the district challenged the law on several grounds including that it violated free speech and is unconstitutionally vague.Advertisementcindy.carcamo@latimes.comALSO:AdvertisementNew York’s ‘cannibal cop’ is convictedJudge blocks NYC ban on large sugary drinksAdvertisementHarvard faculty outraged after administration spies on emails,0
43,The Department of Justice has summarily removed federal funding from two Louisiana youth programs because a local official refused to sign a pledge stating he would require the programs to ban mentions of God.Julian Whittington the sheriff of Bossier Parish LA told Fox News that Obama’s Justice Office of Civil Rights de-funded the Young Marines chapter and another youth program over mentions of religion. In the case of the Young Marine program chartered in 1965 the funding was cut off because the group features an oath that mentions “God.” In the other case it was because a program for at-risk youth featured a voluntary student-led prayer session as one of its activities.Sheriff Whittington says that the DOJ withdrew a combined $30000 from the programs because the groups refused to remove God from their activities. The sheriff said this was evidence of the government’s “aggression and infringement of our religious freedoms.”Whittington told Fox “We were informed that these are unacceptable inherently religious activities and the Department of Justice would not be able to fund the programs if it continued. They wanted a letter from me stating that I would no longer have voluntary prayer and I would also have to remove ‘God’ from the Young Marine’s oath.”The oath from the Young Marine organization reads:From this day forward I sincerely promise I will set an example for all other youth to follow and I shall never do anything that would bring disgrace or dishonor upon God my Country and its flag my parents myself or the Young Marines. These I will honor and respect in a manner that will reflect credit upon them and myself. Semper FidelisBoth the U.S. Army enlistment oath and its commissioning oath end with “so help me God.”As to the at-risk youth program Whittington said”We’re not promoting any specific religion this is just voluntary prayer mention of God how offensive and bad can that be?”In response to the DOJ’s message insisting that he sign the anti-God pledge Sheriff Whittington sent a letter of his own to LA Governor Bobby Jindal.“As a Christian Sheriff and American citizen I am writing to express my frustration and concern over the persistent aggression and infringement of our religious freedoms which have been imposed upon the law enforcement grant programs specifically related to the Louisiana Commission on Law Enforcement” wrote the Sheriff.In cutting off the funding the DOJ claimed it was a violation of Church and State rules for the government to fund any group that mentions God.Fox’s Todd Starnes says that “Both youth programs have been hailed as a successful way to reach at-risk young people. Since 2002 more than 1000 young people have graduated from the program directed by a Bossier Parish deputy who is a former U.S. Marine.”Like Sheriff Whittington Rep. John Fleming (R-LA) was troubled by the DOJ’s actions.“There is a very wide effort coming out of the administration that seeks to stamp out freedom of expressions – particularly religion and especially freedom of Christian expression” Fleming said. “They are willing to throw the youth overboard and remove the funding just in the name of making this an atheist agnostic secular organization.” “They (DOJ) don’t want anything to have any sort of religious support – even down to prayer” Fleming said. “It’s sad and it’s inconsistent with the intentions of the framers of the Constitution.”Sheriff Whittington is not taking this lying down. “When something is not right and you know it’s not right and you keep bowing down nothing is ever going to change” he said.,1
44,In a commencement address in Atlanta on Sunday to graduating seniors at Morehouse College President Barack Obama told graduates to fulfill the “special obligation I felt as a black man like you.” The all-male historically black liberal arts college was also the alma mater of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. among other famous graduates.The president told the graduating students that their background meant they had a duty “to create greater justice both in your own community but also across our country. To make sure everyone has a voice; everyone gets a seat at the table; to make sure that everyone – no matter what they look like or where they come from or who they love – gets a chance to walk through those doors of opportunity if they want it bad enough.”Obama cited his own life as an example several times during his speech touting his success as a father while also acknowledging some “bad choices” he made in his youth–a veiled reference to his admitted past drug use which Obama has often acknowledged in books speeches and debates.He also admonished Morehouse graduates who aimed to join the professions that they ought to serve the poor:So yes go get that law degree. But ask yourself if the only option is to defend the rich and powerful or if you can also find time to defend the powerless. Yes go get your MBA or start that business. But ask yourself what broader purpose your business might serve in putting people to work or transforming a neighborhood….Some of you may be headed to medical school to become doctors. But make sure you heal folks in underserved communities who really need it too.(Here the president did not mention his own rather unique career path as an attorney which included defending landlords in large urban housing developments who had evicted tenants in winter or failed to provide necessary services.)In one portion of his speech the president touted Obamacare–and encouraged the graduates to sign up for the new health insurance exchanges created by his signature legislation.Obama seems to have been carrying out the advice of Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel brother of Obama’s former chief of staff who argued recently in the Wall Street Journal that young Americans would have to be targeted by a propaganda campaign if the system were not to be dangerously underfunded: “Every commencement address by an administration official should encourage young graduates to get health insurance” Dr. Emanuel wrote.Obama advised the graduating class that racism could no longer be leaned upon as a reason for failure: “We’ve got no time for excuses” he said. He also acknowledged that the U.S. had become tolerant enough to elect a black president. And yet Obama described a nation in which discrimination is still rampant:See as Morehouse Men many of you know what it’s like to be an outsider; to be marginalized; to feel the sting of discrimination. That’s an experience that so many other Americans share. Hispanic Americans know that feeling when someone asks where they come from or tells them to go back. Gay and lesbian Americans feel it when a stranger passes judgment on their parenting skills or the love they share. Muslim Americans feel it when they’re stared at with suspicion because of their faith. Any woman who knows the injustice of earning less pay for doing the same work – she sure feels it.The premise of Obama’s claim is at odds with recent global survey data which indicates that the U.S. is among the least racist countries in the world. It is also at odds with the record of his own political career. In the recent past President Obama has been guilty of many of the sins described above–touting deportations of illegal immigrants; opposing gay marriage until a year ago; moving Muslims out of campaign photographs for fear of arousing prejudice; and most notoriously paying women less than men in both his Senate and White House offices.Overall President Obama’s remarks repeated a pattern of recent graduation speeches in which he minimized individual achievement in favor of collective obligation.Curiously he barely mentioned government which he has been at great pains to defend in some recent addresses–speeches that have drawn wider criticism in the wake of recent scandals involving abuses of government power.The word “government” appeared five times in his recent Ohio State commencement speech but not once in the Morehouse address where the only mentions of government careers were his own presidency and the Atlanta mayoralty of Maynard Jackson.Obama’s emphasis at Morehouse was on voluntary service to the community–a theme closer to the American philosophical tradition albeit reformulated to suit the policies and prerogatives of the administration and the Democratic Party.,0
45,On Friday a top political adviser to left-wing billionaire George Soros met with leftist organizations to form a new group called the Latino Victory Project the Washington Post’s Matea Gold reports. The group is connected to Hollywood actress Eva Longoria a longtime supporter of President Barack Obama’s political campaigns.Gold notes that the Soros adviser and a network of about 30 other left-wing “donors fundraisers and union leaders” met on Friday to develop “a strategy to make the [immigration] issue central in next year’s midterm elections if Congress does not pass a bill identifying 10 House Republicans who would be vulnerable to pressure from Latino constituents.”“The meeting was attended by officials from several labor unions including the National Education Association and the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees as well as representatives of deep-pocketed backers of liberal causes including a political adviser to billionaire George Soros” Gold added.The 10 Republicans they are targeting are Reps. Jeff Denham (R-CA) Buck McKeon (R-CA) Gary Miller (R-CA) David Valadao (R-CA) Daniel Webster (R-FL) Mike Coffman (R-CO) Scott Tipton (R-CA) Joe Heck (R-NV) Steve Pearce (R-NM) and Randy Weber (R-TX). These representatives are largely split on immigration efforts.Pearce for instance does not support the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” bill or anything like it. “You can’t get control of the borders if you tell people you can come here illegally and you can work until you work your way to the front of the line” Pearce said in an interview with the New York Times‘ Ashley Parker in August. “The whole world would want to do it that way. Who would want to wait and do it properly?”Weber who represents the district of former Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX) spoke at an anti-amnesty rally on Capitol Hill in June alongside Reps. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) and Steve King (R-TX). “The president has the authority to secure our border” Weber said at the event. “He should do it today. In fact he should have done it yesterday.”Denham on the other hand supports amnesty at one point issuing verbal support for the Senate bill but backtracking after immense pressure from conservatives and constituents over the course of August. Since the congressional recess Denham has come out to publicly endorse House Democrats’ amnesty plan which was introduced by House Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) earlier this month. Denham has also publicly claimed that House Speaker John Boehner promised that in the next “month or so” there would be a vote on immigration legislation in the House of Representatives.Boehner spokesman Michael Steel has not confirmed or denied these claims.The group of left-wing donors that Soros’ top political aide attended was borne out of a fundraising committee called the Futuro Fund which raised more than $30 million for Obama’s re-election campaing. “Led by actress Eva Longoria Puerto Rico lawyer Andres Lopez and San Antonio businessman Henry R. Muñoz III the fund represented the most robust demonstration yet of the Latino community’s ability to amass cash for U.S. political campaigns” Gold wrote.Cristobal Alex a former program officer at the Ford Foundation left his position there to lead the Latino Victory Project as the new group’s president. “What we want to do with the Latino Victory Project is build political power in the Latino community so that the faces of Latinos are reflected not just in every level of government but in the policies that drive the country forward” Alex said.Moving forward the Post noted the group will agree to spend anywhere from $1 million to $2 million per target district. “The effort will begin in coming weeks with a campaign aimed at persuading the lawmakers to back an immigration measure this year” Gold wrote. “If that fails the group plans to run a barrage of radio and TV ads against them next year.”The AFL-CIO’s immigration campaign manager Tom Snyder said each of these GOP lawmakers has a target on their backs. “There was agreement in the room that if we don’t see action in the House we know who we’re going after” Snyder said. “There’s a realization that we have to get back to basics. We’re at the point where if you don’t act we’re going to have to make you pay at the ballot box.”Amalia Perea Mahoney a Chicago-area art gallery owner who the Los Angeles Times reported raked in between $200000 and $500000 for Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign said the group is “all very united” in its purpose. “I think it’s a pivotal moment” she said. Mahoney is also an Obama appointee to an federal arts board.Soros has spent $100 million since 1997 backing what his Open Society Foundation calls “immigrant rights” groups and projects. Some of those projects like Soros’ National Immigration Forum-backed Evangelical Immigration Table (EIT) were meant to create the illusion of grassroots support for amnesty where there was none. Recent polling data released by NumbersUSA conducted by Pulse Opinion Research shows that Evangelical Republican likely voters disagree with the push for amnesty despite the Soros group’s claims there is grassroots support among Evangelicals for the policy.Recently Rep. Raul Labrador (R-ID) a supporter of immigration reform withdrew from the House’s version of the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” and announced his public opposition to negotiating with Obama and the Senate on immigration saying such negotiations would be “crazy” for House GOP leadership to enter into. Labrador said House GOP leadership would not be smart to deal with these people because they are trying to “destroy” the Republican Party.,1
46,Highlighting the importance of the African American vote in the May 21 mayoral runoff Wendy Greuel and Eric Garcetti held dueling news conferences in South Los Angeles on Thursday to tout new endorsements from highly sought black leaders. At various points some of the participants even got a little testy.Basketball legend Magic Johnson backed Greuel saying that he selected the city controller because of her broad range of experience in the public and private sectors her longtime ties to the African American community and the historic nature of her candidacy to be the city’s first female mayor.Advertisement“We love this woman because she loves us. We love this woman because she’s been in our community many many years and the fact that she’s going to get the job done” Johnson said standing alongside a broad cross-section of religious civic and elected leaders at a church on Crenshaw Boulevard.L.A. ELECTIONS 2013: Sign up for our email newsletterAdvertisement“Wendy I am in your campaign ready to go door-to-door with you” he said. “We want to make sure you are the next mayor. We’re going to make history like we did for President Obama.”Garcetti meanwhile picked up the backing of City Councilwoman Jan Perry who said she chose her fellow council member because of his track record — and to send a message to special interests that spent millions of dollars supporting Greuel in the primary.Advertisement“There has been and there will be a tremendous amount of money donated to one candidate in this race from various special interests and I believe that we need to take a stand to let everyone know that the city of Los Angeles cannot be bought” said Perry who unsuccessfully ran for mayor this year.FULL COVERAGE: L.A.'s race for mayorAdvertisementAlthough Perry did not mention Greuel by name in her remarks she could not hide her disdain for the controller as she took questions from reporters. During the primary Greuel slashed at Perry’s personal financial background in the closing days of the race. Greuel called her after the primary and Perry said she did not return the call. She paraphrased poet Maya Angelou in explaining why: “Dr. Angelou says ‘Thank you for letting me know who you are.’ So I’m clear. I understand. I got the memo. It was clear to me that I didn’t need to engage in any false pretenses because that’s not who I am” Perry said.“The memo says I do not respect you and that I respect you so little that I would delve into your personal background and then mischaracterize it to boot and then buy time with my own campaign money and put it on websites all over the country” Perry said. “Instead of dealing with substance she went to the personal. That was not necessary.”AdvertisementGreuel brushed off the criticism.“We are public figures. Everything we are doing is [an] open book as people are making choices about the future” she told reporters after her news conference. “I received a lot of blows during this campaign during the beginning. This is for the public to decide.”AdvertisementEarlier while thanking Johnson for his endorsement she flubbed the sport played by the former Lakers point guard who is now part-owner of the Dodgers.“It is so important to me be endorsed by Magic Johnson who has been giving back to this community all his life” she said. “We know a lot of celebrities come and go. This celebrity this leader has been a person who has stayed in this community and given back.”Advertisement“I grew up Magic watching you play baseball” Greuel said as the crowd interrupted to correct her that Johnson had played basketball.“You did everything right I thought baseball too. See I was thinking Dodgers today. Yay Dodgers!” she said clapping her hands. “He can do everything. So five NBA championships new ownership for the Dodgers millions invested in our community and an inspiration for Angelenos all across Los Angeles on dealing with the issue of AIDS. And [he has] been an amazing friend particularly here in South Los Angeles. You have never forgotten.”AdvertisementGarcetti said he was “so very proud” to receive Perry’s nod saying that the councilwoman brought a strong independent voice to the mayoral primary and the two shared a passion for revitalizing communities block by block.“There’s a clear difference in this race. While others are running on rhetoric we’re a campaign of results. Voters can see the results themselves” Garcetti said. “No matter how many attacks people made against Jan or me just walk the streets of our districts just see the jobs on the streets the cranes downtown the cranes in Hollywood…. That’s what Jan Perry and I are going to do together when I am mayor … in South Los Angeles and citywide.”AdvertisementPerry came in fourth in the primary receiving nearly 16% of the vote with heavy support among African American voters in South Los Angeles. If those supporters vote as a bloc in the runoff it could place Garcetti or Greuel within grasp of victory.Since the March 5 primary the candidates have been heavily competing to roll out endorsements with Greuel snagging former President Bill Clinton on Monday. Garcetti and Perry on Thursday questioned the value of Greuel’s big-name endorsers such as Clinton and Johnson questioning what kind of influence they have with city voters — church groups neighborhood councils and the like — as they make a decision.Advertisement“I admire Magic Johnson very much. He’s a great role model he’s a tremendous athlete he’s a great businessman he’s a very wealthy man a member of the Guggenheim organization. And you know I don’t know if I’d call that grass-roots but it’s OK” Perry said. “And I’m happy that he’s wealthy. I have a lot of love for him.”Johnson bristled at this remark saying that he has deep long-standing ties to South Los Angeles.Advertisement“I’m not a celebrity. I’m a man of this community and a businessman and so people know that” he told reporters. “I’m the one who started all this business. When you look on Crenshaw I started that with that Starbucks down there.”“I’m the one who started redevelopment in South Los Angeles not Jan Perry. I did it” he said. “I love Jan. She’s a good person and she did a wonderful job with what she did downtown but in L.A. South L.A. I’m the one.”AdvertisementLate in the day primary contender Kevin James — who finished third just ahead of Perry — emailed his backers asking them to recommend whom if anyone he should endorse.seema.mehta@latimes.com,0
47,In July two dozen accomplished women — bankers law firm partners and technology executives — sat Christine C. Quinn down in a conference room in the Met Life building for some honest talk about her quest to become New York’s first female mayor.They were getting worried they told her as they watched her slip in the polls and struggle to respond to attacks.The participants including Mary Ann Tighe the real estate executive and Diana L. Taylor girlfriend of the current mayor warned Ms. Quinn that a woman seeking power always faced perils and that the very qualities that had brought her this far — drive ambition toughness — could make her unlikable to many.But Ms. Quinn was not interested in talking about that.“I don’t get up in the morning thinking about how I’ll approach this as a woman or a lesbian; I think about the issues” she said according to an organizer of the session.,1
48,Arizona officials said they will continue to use state voter registration forms that require a prospective voter to prove citizenship despite a Supreme Court ruling that struck down the requirement on federal forms.Hours after voting rights advocates were hailing Monday’s Supreme Court decision officials indicated that Arizona will take advantage of a provision in the ruling allowing the state to seek to continue requiring the added documentation while it appeals to a federal agency. In effect the Supreme Court’s ruling which was viewed as a step forward in national voter registration law could have a less of an immediate impact within the state.Advertisement“The next step is going to the EAC” Arizona Atty. Gen. Tom Horne said of the federal Elections Assistance Commission the agency that developed the federal form. After that agency the state can go back to the courts where the state believes it can win and get to keep the requirement of added documentation on citizenship Horne said in a telephone interview with the Los Angeles Times.“The state form will not change only the federal form” Matthew Roberts director of communications for Arizona Secretary of State Ken Bennett said in a telephone interview. Roberts said officials will continue distributing the Arizona form which is used for about 95% of all voter registration. Only about 5% of the registrations come via the federal form he said.AdvertisementThe decision by state officials was expected since Arizona has been fighting for the tougher requirements for years. Local advocates however had earlier said they hoped to work with the state to revise the Arizona registration form in light of the Supreme Court ruling.“We certainly hope our election officials would not continue to fight this” said Sam Wercinski executive director of the Arizona Advocacy network one of the groups involved in seeking to overturn the Arizona citizenship requirements. “This is a very clear decision” he said in a conference call by several groups involved in the case.AdvertisementEarlier Monday the Supreme Court announced that it had had thrown out Arizona’s requirement that a prospective voter show proof of citizenship. It ruled against Arizona 7-2 in Arizona vs. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona Inc. The court said that the state policy approved by voters as Proposition 200 in 2004 was at odds with the 1993 National Voter Registration Act also known as the “motor voter” law.The federal law was designed to increase participation particularly among minorities by making it more convenient for people to sign up to vote by filling out a form when getting a driver’s license for example. On the federal form the applicant has to swear that he is a citizen under penalty of perjury. But Arizona went one step further requiring proof of citizenship such as a passport or birth certificate.AdvertisementAdvocates sued arguing that the federal form didn’t require such documentation and should be the standard. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that National Voter Registration Act is the controlling law rather than Proposition 200. The case eventually went to the Supreme Court.Federal law “precludes Arizona from requiring a federal form applicant to submit information beyond that required by the form itself” Justice Antonia Scalia wrote for the court’s majority. In his ruling however Scalia said the state could continue to make a case before the federal agency and depending on that ruling again appeal to the courts.Advertisement“I think the court has given us a clear path to victory” Atty. Gen. Horne said. He argued that the court affirmed the right of states to set their own standards for voting.Opponents of the Arizona law said they see it as an effort to limit participation by minorities and immigrants. In the conference call they said more than 31000 potential voters were blocked from registering. Voter registration through community-based drives dropped by 44% in Arizona’s largest county Maricopa according to Maldef the Latino civil rights group.Advertisement“We don’t think it will be successful” Nina Perales Maldef’s vice president for litigation said of Arizona’s continuing effort to fight for its law. She argued that the state had a chance to provide documentation that the added requirements were needed but had failed to do so.“Proposition 200 was a new starting point in the war on voters in Arizona” Wercinski said.Advertisement“Individuals want to register and vote” he said during the conference call. “Opponents have tried to increase barriers over and over again.... When people register they will vote.”For groups opposed to the Arizona law including the ACLU and the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law Monday’s ruling was major step forward.Advertisement“Today’s decision is a significant victory for U.S. citizens and their ability to register to vote without burdensome requirements” said Wade Henderson president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. “In our democracy if you don’t vote you don’t count and the Arizona law was a blatant effort to keep some citizens from making their voice heard in our elections.”ALSO:AdvertisementNYU denies it is evicting Chen GuangchengWorst is over in Colorado fires officials sayAdvertisementWhitey Bulger trial resumes with an ex-hit man due on standmichael.muskal@latimes.com,0

50,"Blow's final two paragraphs which come immediately after referencing Bibeau read as follows:That is because as Talking Points Memo says “Obama voters would have received almost exactly 3/5 of the electoral vote compared to their actual population — 30.7 percent of the electoral vote over 51 percent of the popular vote.” This is not where we should be in 2013 debating whether to pass bills to reduce urban voters to a fraction of the value of other voters and hoping that someone with the power to stop it thinks it’s a “bad idea.”The bill will not become law in Virginia. A key Republican state senator opposes it so it might not even get out of committee in the state senate; the Lt. Gov opposes it and since he has already said he will not break 20-20 ties that are strictly partisan (and the senate is split 20-20 between the two parties) even if it reached the floor he seems committed to killing it; and the Governor opposes it so even were it to reach his desk he seems committed to vetoing it.It is worth noting that unlike the two states that now distribute electoral votes by Congressional district (Maine which has never split and Nebraska which in 2008 gave on e EV to OBama) and as far as I know ALL other current proposals rather than giving the two EV votes equivalent to the two senators to the candidate winning the statewide total the Virginia proposal would award the final two EVS to the candidate winning the majority of the Congressional districts not the majority of the state's votes. Those districts were heavily gerrymandered because in 2008 the Dems had won 6 of the state's electoral votes and even though Glenn Nye and Tom Perriello and Rick Boucher were defeated in 2010 the Republicans were taking no chances and redrew the CDs to make them more Republican friendly. Obama actually won one CD represented by a Republican.The proposal came from a state senator whose intention seems racist - he wants rural (for which you can read ""white"") voters not to be outvoted by urban (for which you can read ""black"" and to a lesser degree ""Hispanic"") voters.It will not go anywhere.It is ironic that the vote distribution turned out to so closely match the ratio of the 3/5 Compromise.But then part of the pushback against Obama has from the beginning been because he was Black.Odd that the ratio would now increasingly include young people and women as well as people of color.Again it won't happen in Virginia.It seems like the parallel in Florida is also dead because the Republican heads of the two chambers of the state legislature are opposed to splitting the electoral vote.But let's be clear - the intent of such proposal is not merely to steal states for Republicans that they might not otherwise win it is to diminish the value of the votes of minorities and expand the power of angry old white men.Like the attempts this past cycle at voter suppression through voter-id laws and limiting access to early voting this will produce a backlash.Perhaps those pushing such proposals really do want to make Obama voters count for only 3/5.In the process what they might be demonstrating is that they themselves have only 3/5 the intelligence and moral character of those whose votes they seek to diminish.",0

52,Tom Edsall on politics inside and outside of Washington.Although there was plenty of discussion during the 2012 presidential campaign about the Hispanic vote and how intense black turnout would be the press was preoccupied with the white vote: the white working class white women and upscale whites.Largely missing from daily news stories were references to research on how racial attitudes have changed under Obama the nation’s first black president. In fact there has been an interesting exploration of this subject among academics but before getting to that let’s look back at some election results.In the 16 presidential elections between 1952 and 2012 only one Democratic candidate Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 won a majority of the white vote. There have been nine Democratic presidential nominees who received a smaller percentage of the white vote than Obama did in 2008 (43 percent) and four who received less white support than Obama did in 2012 (39 percent).In 2012 Obama won 39 percent of the white electorate. Four decades earlier in 1972 George McGovern received a record-setting low of the ballots cast by whites 31 percent. In 1968 Hubert Humphrey won 36 percent of the white vote; in 1980 Jimmy Carter got 33 percent; in 1984 Walter Mondale took 35 percent of the ballots cast by whites. As far back as 1956 Adlai Stevenson tied Obama’s 39 percent and in 1952 Stevenson received 40 percent – both times running against Dwight D. Eisenhower. Two Democratic nominees from Massachusetts Michael Dukakis in 1988 (40 percent) and John Kerry in 2004 (41 percent) got white margins only slightly higher than Obama’s in 2012 — and worse than Obama’s 43 percent in 2008. In other words Obama’s track record with white voters is not very different from that of other Democratic candidates.Ballots cast for House candidates provide another measure of white partisanship. These contests have been tracked in exit polls from 1980 onward. Between 1980 and 1992 the white vote for Democratic House candidates averaged 49.6 percent. It dropped sharply in 1994 when Newt Gingrich orchestrated the Republican take-over of the House averaging just 42.7 percent from 1994 through 2004. White support for Democrats rose to an average of 46.7 percent in 2006 and 2008 as public disapproval of George W. Bush and of Republicans in Congress sharply increased.How can the percentage of people holding anti-black attitudes have increased from 2006 to 2008 at a time when Obama performed better among white voters than the two previous white Democratic nominees and then again from 2008 to 2012 when Obama won a second term?In the aftermath of Obama’s election white support for Congressional Democrats collapsed to its lowest level in the history of House exit polling 38 percent in 2010 — at once driving and driven by the emerging Tea Party. In 2012 white Democratic support for House candidates remained weak at 39 percent.Despite how controversial it has been to talk about race researchers have gathered a substantial amount of information on the opinions of white American voters.The political scientists Michael Tesler of Brown University and David O. Sears of UCLA have published several studies on this theme and they have also written a book “Obama’s Race: The 2008 Election and the Dream of a Post-Racial America” that analyzes changes in racial attitudes since Obama became the Democratic nominee in 2008.In their 2010 paper “President Obama and the Growing Polarization of Partisan Attachments by Racial Attitudes and Race” Tesler and Sears argue that theevidence strongly suggests that party attachments have become increasingly polarized by both racial attitudes and race as a result of Obama’s rise to prominence within the Democratic Party.Specifically Tesler and Sears found that voters high on a racial-resentment scale moved one notch toward intensification of partisanship within the Republican Party on a seven-point scale from strong Democrat through independent to strong Republican.To measure racial resentment which Tesler and Sears describe as “subtle hostility towards African-Americans” the authors used data from the American National Election Studies and the General Social Survey an extensive collection of polling data maintained at the University of Chicago.In the case of A.N.E.S. data Tesler and Sears write:The scale was constructed from how strongly respondents agreed or disagreed with the following assertions: 1) Irish Italian Jewish and many other minorities overcame prejudice and worked their way up. Blacks should do the same without any special favors. 2) Generations of slavery and discrimination have created conditions that make it difficult for blacks to work their way out of the lower class. 3) Over the past few years blacks have gotten less than they deserve. 4) It’s really a matter of some people not trying hard enough; if blacks would only try harder they could be just as well off as whites.The General Social Survey included questions asking respondents to rate competing causes of racial discrimination and inequality:The scale was constructed from responses to the following 4 items: 1) Irish Italian Jewish and many other minorities overcame prejudice and worked their way up. Blacks should do the same without any special favors. 2) A 3-category variable indicating whether respondents said lack of motivation is or is not a reason for racial inequality. 3) A 3-category variable indicating whether respondents said discrimination is or is not a reason for racial inequality. 4) A three-category variable indicating whether respondents rated whites more less or equally hardworking than blacks on 7 point stereotype scales.Supporting the Tesler-Sears findings Josh Pasek a professor in the communication studies department at the University of Michigan Jon A. Krosnick a political scientist at Stanford and Trevor Tompson the director of the Associated Press-National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago use responses from three different surveys in their analysis of “The Impact of Anti-Black Racism on Approval of Barack Obama’s Job Performance and on Voting in the 2012 Presidential Election.”Pasek and his collaborators found a statistically significant increase from 2008 to 2012 in “explicit anti-black attitudes” – a measure based on questions very similar those used by Tesler and Sears for their racial-resentment scale. The percentage of voters with explicit anti-black attitudes rose from 47.6 in 2008 and 47.3 percent in 2010 to 50.9 percent in 2012.Crucially Pasek found that Republicans drove the change: “People who identified themselves as Republicans in 2012 expressed anti-Black attitudes more often than did Republican identifiers in 2008.”In 2008 Pasek and his collaborators note the proportion of people expressing anti-Black attitudes was 31 percent among Democrats 49 percent among independents and 71 percent among Republicans. By 2012 the numbers had gone up. “The proportion of people expressing anti-Black attitudes” they write “was 32 percent among Democrats 48 percent among independents and 79 percent among Republicans.”At the moment the population of the United States (314 million) is heading towards a majority-minority status in 2042.The American electorate on the other hand (126 million) is currently 72 percent white based on the voters who cast ballots last November.Obama’s ascendency to the presidency means that on race the Rubicon has been crossed (2008) and re-crossed (2012).What are we to make of these developments? Is the country more or less racist? How can the percentage of people holding anti-black attitudes have increased from 2006 to 2008 at a time when Obama performed better among white voters than the two previous white Democratic nominees and then again from 2008 to 2012 when Obama won a second term?In fact the shifts described by Tesler and Pasek are an integral aspect of the intensifying conservatism within the right wing of the Republican Party. Many voters voicing stronger anti-black affect were already Republican. Thus in 2012 shifts in their attitudes while they contributed to a 4 percentage point reduction in Obama’s white support did not result in a Romney victory.Some Republican strategists believe the party’s deepening conservatism is scaring away voters.“We have a choice: we can become a shrinking regional party of middle-aged and older white men or we can fight to become a national governing party” John Weaver a consultant to the 2008 McCain campaign said after Obama’s re-election. Mark McKinnon an adviser to former President George W. Bush made a similar point: “The party needs more tolerance more diversity and a deeper appreciation for the concerns of the middle class.”Not only is the right risking marginalization as its views on race have become more extreme it is veering out of the mainstream on contraception and abortion positions that fueled an 11 point gender gap in 2012 and a 13 point gap in 2008.Given that a majority of the electorate will remain white for a number of years the hurdle that the Republican Party faces is building the party’s white margins by 2 to 3 points. For Romney to have won he needed 62 percent of the white vote not the 59 percent he got.Working directly against this goal is what Time Magazine recently described as the Republican “brand identity that has emerged from the stars of the conservative media ecosystem: Rush Limbaugh Sean Hannity Bill O’Reilly Ann Coulter and others.”It is not so much Latino and black voters that the Republican Party needs. To win the White House again it must assuage the social conscience of mainstream moderate white voters among whom an ethos of tolerance has become normal. These voters are concerned with fairness and diversity even as they stand to the right of center. It is there that the upcoming political battles — on the gamut of issues from race to rights — will be fought.,0

54,"First says Attorney General Greg Abbott the redistricting is not about race. Oh no. It's about not allowing DEMOCRATS to vote. White Democrats too.From their brief:DOJ’s accusations of racial discrimination are baseless. In 2011 both houses of the Texas Legislature were controlled by large Republican majorities and their redistricting decisions were designed to increase the Republican Party’s electoral prospects at the expense of the Democrats....The redistricting decisions of which DOJ complains were motivated by partisan rather than racial considerations and the plaintiffs and DOJ have zero evidence to prove the contrary. It is perfectly constitutional for a Republican-controlled legislature to make partisan districting decisions even if there are incidental effects on minority voters who support Democratic candidates.Translation:""So basically we just want to fuck over all Democrats and if the Black and Brown people are also hurt well they shouldn't vote for Democrats should they? It's only collateral damage""You know having them actually come right out and say it--that they don't want Democrats to vote--is somehow not surprising. But it's good that they're doing it at last.But wait! There's more. To address the actual accusations of racial bias and discrimination Texas is using the argument that ""Yeah there may be an isolated incident or two but it's NOTHING like it was in 1965"".From the article which says it better than I can:Furthermore the state claims even if Texas did discriminate and the state stresses that it did not it was nothing as bad as “the ‘pervasive’ ‘flagrant’ ‘widespread’ and ‘rampant’ discrimination that originally justified preclearance in 1965.” So as long as Texas skies aren’t alight with flames from burning crosses what’s the big whoop?So according to this Texas is arguing that Section 2 and in fact the entire reasons for preclearance are all based on conditions in 1965. And that since ""things are better than in 1965"" then Section 2 is null and void.I think the fact that Texas is second only to Mississippi in Section 2 lawsuits is the basis for this particular argument.However there is a danger here. Texas is arguing that ONLY conditions that existed in 1965 would justify Federal supervision of the elections process. Sort of like an ""originalism to the extreme"" argument.And that can be dangerous because there are those on the Supreme Court that would like nothing more than the total eradication of the Voting Rights Act.Not to mention the 13th 14th and 15th Amendments but that's another story.",0
55,"So I am overjoyed about what happened in Texas not the least because it was so unexpected and so....freaking great. I loved every minute of it and can't tell you how happy I am to have a new Democratic hero in Wendy Davis.I want to make this very clear so people will understand what is in my heart as I write this diary. I watched the breathless news tonight on MSNBC and I saw Kos's effort to draft MS. Davis to run for governor and I'm all over it all.But there was a part of me that felt SO sad too. I remember when Wisconsin's capitol was filled w/that kind of crowd for WEEKS ON END. I remember when Democrats and progressives in Wisconsin filled not only the rotunda of their capitol but all the real estate they could in every direction OUTSIDE the capitol for WEEKS ON END.And most here at the DK supported the effort and it was thrilling. Then came the recall and we lost. I could say why I think this happened but it doesn't matter. It just did. And since then despite all those thrilling hopeful days things have only gotten worse in Wisconsin.And one of the biggest ways that has happened is the Wisconsin republican answer to seeing THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN as long as they're in power. They have made endless laws to make sure of that. And now what happened in Texas last night will be very difficult for Wisconsin to match. It's crazy. Possible in Texas almost impossible in Wisconsin.Those of us caught up on the new laws and restrictions regarding what is allowable in the state house and who can be there and under what conditions know how fast after the loss of the recall the GOP clamped down on seeing to it that nothing like the anti Walker uprising would happen again on their watch. I could go on for many paragraphs here telling you how specific and restrictive those new laws are. I could roll your socks back as to the totalitarian and successful cap the Wisconsin GOP has put on anything like what happened in Texas yesterday and what happened in Wisconsin week after week at one time not so long ago.Recently the Republican Wisconsin legislature voted to pass a law similar to what was at stake in Texas. The ""gallery"" was highly restricted. Women w/tape over their mouths---to signify protest to the new rules of their being there---were told to remove the tape or be arrested. They removed the tape and covered their mouths w/their hands. Some Democrats in the chamber tried to shout their way into their right to be heard.But in the end Mike Ellis broke his gavel telling everyone to shut the fuck up they would NOT be heard. This disgraceful behavior was shown here a bit on video and God bless her on Rachel Maddow's show. Other than that crickets. The nation has left the story of Wisconsin behind. We tried we lost and journalism is not about losers.I CHEER what happened in Texas yesterday with all my heart. BUT beware of the media story on your side today. Because it can be gone tomorrow. And don't underestimate the response of republicans when they have been so challenged. I'll bet you the little money I have in the bank that Texas too will soon have a bunch of laws that make it impossible for what happened yesterday to happen again. The only reason they aren't there now in Texas is because what happened surprised the hell out of them. Don't doubt for a minute that they're gathered in back rooms as I write this figuring out to make sure it never happens to them again.I cheer every minute of attention Texas gets w/this and I cheer Wendy Davis. I don't want it to go away. But I know it will. My message here is not about cynicism or about ""don't bother."" IT. IS. NOT.My message is that we are on the brink of so much in this country and we have to find a way to stop letting them get away with this. And that means in Wisconsin too no matter how gerrymandered it is. I frankly don't know how to do this. But I do know the answer is NOT to bow out from the fight in a heap of disappointment and anger. And I don't for a minute suggest that's what Wisconsin Democrats are doing. BUT everything is so much harder for them now.Wisconsin must find a way to rise again and Texas must find a way to hold on to this win. And part of that is seeing what's coming. And I'm telling you what's coming in Texas. Somehow some way we must stop this. And that means we have to decide our priorities as Democrats. And there in lies the rub. And I have no answer for it.",0
56,During the 11 years she spent as labor minister in her state Ms. Dreyer — a trained lawyer who served as a state prosecutor in Bad Kreuznach before entering politics as the mayor of that same city — became known for tackling problems at the source. She held roundtable meetings to discuss the issue of caring for the elderly in nursing homes so that workers could participate. Her own experiences as the mother of a patchwork family with three children and resident of a publicly sponsored social living project have contributed to her image of being straightforward and someone to whom average people can relate.Bettina Munimus a researcher with the European Academy for Women in Politics and Economics based in Berlin said that Ms. Dreyer’s more consensus-oriented approach is indicative of an overall shift visible in the other states where women are now in charge — including the biggest North Rhine-Westphalia as well as Saarland and Thuringia.“In the previous generation the old male politicians used the ‘basta’ style of politics to outwardly demonstrate power and the need for the final word” Ms. Munimus said. Not so the female governors. “They know that power is needed to bring about policy but along the way it is important to cooperate to create policy with others. That is the identifying factor of this style.”Since 2010 another Social Democrat Hannelore Kraft has governed North Rhine-Westphalia Germany’s most populous state and one known for decades as much for its old boys’ political network as for its heavy industry.Ms. Kraft was forced to settle right after her election for a minority government that relied on the support of political foes to pass legislation. Together with the deputy governor Sylvia Löhrmann from the Greens Ms. Kraft dubbed her government the “invitation coalition” and got to work.Two years later her fragile constellation collapsed and Ms. Kraft faced off against a former minister from Ms. Merkel’s conservative party in fresh elections last May. Not only did Ms. Kraft retain her governorship; she won a clear majority in the state legislature for government with the Greens.Many Germans would have liked to see Ms. Kraft run as the Social Democratic candidate challenging Ms. Merkel for the chancellorship in September elections. A recent survey by Statista pollsters showed the 51-year-old the third most popular politician in the country after Ms. Merkel and Joachim Gauck the German president.,0

60,U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is alleged to be one of the great intellects of conservative jurisprudence but his comments during oral arguments over a challenge to the 1965 Voting Rights Act displayed all the mental acuity of a third-tier talk radio bozo.Shelby County Ala. is making the case against the voting law. Section 5 of the act empowers the federal government to negate new local and state voting rules if they would lead to discrimination against minority voters. It has been enforced primarily in Southern states that had a long dismal history of preventing African Americans from voting. Shelby County contends that the problem has been remedied and so Section 5 is no longer justified.Rep. John Lewis of Georgia begs to differ. Lewis was severely beaten in Selma during the 1965 “Bloody Sunday” police riot directed against peaceful civil rights marchers. The horror of that scene as it played out on America’s television screens led directly to congressional approval of the Voting Rights Act.In an interview with USA Today Lewis talked about the methods used to bar blacks from voting back in 1965 and insisted that more subtle impediments still are being employed to undercut voting rights today.Advertisement“You may not have what we had such as the literacy tests or asking people to count the number of bubbles in a bar of soap or the number of jelly beans in a jar” Lewis said. “It may not be the overt acts of violence that we had and witnessed during the ‘60s. But the result is the same.”As recently as 2006 both houses of Congress agreed with Lewis. After extensive testimony lawmakers determined that a long list of problems still exists and they renewed the Voting Rights Act for an additional 25 years. The vote was overwhelming in the House unanimous in the Senate and was hailed by President George W. Bush as a victory for American democracy.In court on Wednesday however Scalia mocked that vote. He said the Senate’s unanimity simply proved the law had not been given serious consideration. The senators were afraid he said to cast a vote against a law with a “wonderful” name. He went on to assert that the reauthorization of the act was merely “a phenomenon that is called perpetuation of racial entitlement.”That sort of legal reasoning may be good enough for someone sitting on a bar stool well into his third pint but it is not good enough for the highest court in the land. Scalia makes self-serving assumptions about what was on the minds of senators in 2006 -- afraid not serious enamored with a name -- with no facts to back up his barbs.AdvertisementTossing actual statistics back at Scalia Justice Elena Kagan cited a string of continued voting-rights violations. As to the state of mind of the senators she said the unanimous vote was pretty good proof that the evidence of contemporary abuses was convincing even to conservative Southerners.“It was clear to 98 senators including every senator from a covered state who decided that there was a continuing need for this piece of legislation” Kagan said.Undeterred Scalia opined that a law governing voting rights is “not the kind of question you can leave to Congress.” Oh really? The right to vote is the core of our constitutional democracy. It is not as Scalia says “a racial entitlement” it is an American entitlement. It seems that might be a very useful thing for Congress to watch over and protect. It was eminently important in 1965 and remains important today.One need only consider the outrageous voter suppression measures attempted in Ohio Pennsylvania Florida and other states in the 2012 election cycle to see that the right to vote is still something certain Americans must fight for. It is true that impediments put in the way of black and Latino voters now are not so much about racial animosity as they are about the fact that those racial groups overwhelmingly vote for Democrats but the effect as Lewis says is the same.AdvertisementGiven the weirdness of his comments it might not be wrong to assume Scalia’s true concern is less about “racial entitlement” than it is about making sure his fellow Republicans are entitled. Entitled that is to manipulate elections when they can no longer win fair and square.,0
61,Gary May is a history professor at the University of Delaware and the author of “Bending Toward Justice: The Voting Rights Act and the Transformation of American Democracy.”In the debate over the future of the Voting Rights Act  it sometimes becomes apparent that certain members of the Supreme Court are either oblivious to our nation’s recent history or willfully ignore it. Justice Antonin Scalia made this abundantly clear in his comments during the Feb. 27 oral argument in Shelby County v. Holder  statements that he repeated in a speech on April 15.To Scalia the Voting Rights Act — especially Section 5 which requires covered states to submit any changes in voting practices to the Justice Department or a Washington court for approval — is a “racial entitlement” and a violation of state sovereignty. In his view it unfairly and unnecessarily treats seven Southern states plus Alaska Arizona and parts of six others differently from states not covered by the act. This month according to the Wall Street Journal he called the act a form of “racial preferment” that affected only African Americans while ignoring the white population.Such statements indicate that Scalia is woefully ignorant of the legislation’s history. Because of our nation’s painful legacy of racial injustice the Voting Rights Act of 1965 has often been used to safeguard black voters specifically but its protections extend to all Americans regardless of skin color as was vividly demonstrated in the period after its passage.Enactment of the Voting Rights Act also led to the abolition of the poll tax. So in May 1966 African Americans were able to vote freely for the first time in an off-year primary election. Across the South many blacks sought a host of elected offices from county sheriff to seats in state legislatures. In Alabama a Democratic candidate for governor Attorney General Richmond Flowers vigorously campaigned for black votes. If elected he promised he would appoint blacks to positions in his administration — men and women active in the civil rights movement he pledged not “just a few Uncle Toms.”1 of 16 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws the Supreme Court View Photos A collection of cartoons about the high court. Caption A collection of cartoons about the high court. June 27 2013 Tom Toles Wait 1 second to continue.The favorite to win in Alabama however was Flowers’s opponent Lurleen Wallace a stand-in for her husband George the gubernatorial incumbent who was ineligible to run because of term limits. A vote for the Wallace ticket would be a vote for segregation; George Wallace had been the scourge of the civil rights movement in Alabama and had actively incited racial hatred to obtain the support of white voters.On Election Day the turnout was extraordinary. In Selma the polls opened at 8 a.m. but black voters started lining up hours before. In Birmingham a blistering sun caused one older man to faint but when an ambulance arrived he refused to go to the hospital until he had cast his ballot. “This is the first time I’m voting” he said. “It might be my last.”Voting continued far into the night. In Montgomery the polls were supposed to close at 6 p.m. But at 8:30 1100 African Americans were still waiting at the polls and refused to leave before they had voted. At that same hour in Birmingham 700 voters had waited patiently for more than five hours. “It made me think I was sort of somebody” Willie Bolden the 81-year-old grandson of slaves told a reporter.For African Americans the outcome was disappointing. Few black candidates were elected and Mrs. Wallace won a resounding victory with 399024 votes nearly twice as many as her husband had won four years earlier. Few had doubted that Wallace would win but the size of her victory was what was truly surprising. And it was due in part to the Voting Rights Act.Analysts later discovered that while their projections had accounted for the historic enfranchisement of Alabama’s blacks they had missed an equally important development: the even greater expansion of the white vote. By eliminating the literacy tests and other impediments such as the poll tax the Voting Rights Act gave many poor whites the opportunity to register and cast ballots. A skillful get-out-the-vote campaign by Wallace’s staff added 110000 new voters to the white majority decreasing black influence even as the number of black voters grew. Nor was this phenomenon limited to Alabama. Throughout the South many of the new registrants were white.This election indicates that Scalia is wrong when he calls the Voting Rights Act “a racial preferment” that provides no protection for white voters. The act protects all voters especially in the states and districts covered by Section 5 from any obstacles that might be put in their way. That was true in 1966 and remains true today as efforts to suppress the minority vote continue. Scalia needs to do his homework before the court determines the act’s future.,0
62,"Speaker of the House John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) takes his oath on the first day of the 113th Congress. Despite a rocky few weeks during the ""fiscal cliff"" fight Boehner won reelection as speaker.Jan. 3 2013 Speaker of the House John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) takes his oath on the first day of the 113th Congress. Despite a rocky few weeks during the ""fiscal cliff"" fight Boehner won reelection as speaker. Kevin Lamarque/ReutersA record number of women and racial minorities were elected to the 113th Congress which was sworn in Thursday. Among them was the first Buddhist to join the Senate as well as the first Hindu and the first openly bisexual woman in the House.House Democrats became the first caucus in the history of either chamber not to have a majority of white men. It was a watershed moment for the Democratic Party which has adopted diversity as one of its chief selling points and has marketed itself as the party that looks more like a fast-changing United States.“It was a decision” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in an interview about boosting the number of Democratic women in Congress. “We made a decision a long time ago that we were going to try to expand the number. We made a decision for women to help women and also for the Democrats as a party to help recruit women and help fund campaigns.”The overwhelming majority of lawmakers sworn in Thursday were white men. But the new Congress while still lagging behind the nation as whole in diversity reflects national demographic changes that hold significant implications for American politics.Democrats think those changes­ give them a distinct political advantage in a nation in which whites make up a smaller part of the electorate. It also opens new avenues of fundraising to support their campaigns.View Graphic Find out all about the new faces in the 113th congress — sort by state party gender and chamber and see who was elected where and why.Republicans too see the value of diversity and have sought to highlight changes in the GOP. When Jim DeMint (S.C.) recently stepped down from the Senate for instance he was replaced by Tim Scott giving Republicans a chance to claim the only African American in the Senate. Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) a Cuban American also became an instant star among Republicans when he was elected.Overall though Republicans have struggled to diversify their ranks and the party was criticized after the presidential election for mainly appealing to an older whiter coalition. Whether the GOP will adjust its positions to lure more votes from an increasingly diverse electorate is a key question likely to play out in the new Congress.The Democratic diversity was on display Thursday during the vote for House speaker. Pelosi beamed as dozens of women and minorities called out her name as their choice over Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) who was narrowly elected by the Republican majority. Twice her name was read aloud in Spanish.For Pelosi the moment probably paled in comparison to the day six years ago when she in her words “broke the marble ceiling” and was elected the nation’s first female speaker.But for Pelosi 72 who was one of 23 female lawmakers when she was first elected 25 years ago Thursday had different rewards. Maybe no Democrat has been more central to the party’s diversity push than she has.The House has 81 women 61 of them Democrats. The Senate includes 20 women — still just a fifth of the chamber but an achievement striking enough that ABC News gathered the group together for a joint interview that aired on Thursday night.The contrast between the two parties has been stark in recent weeks.A look at the 113th Congress (Sources: Staff reports)When Republicans first circulated a list of their committee chairmen for the 113th Congress showing that every committee would be headed by a white man Pelosi’s office quickly followed up with a flier with photos of the ranking Democrats on the panels.Half of top Democrats on committees are minorities or women. In the debate that followed Boehner named Rep. Candice Miller (R-Mich.) to chair the House Administration Committee a panel on which she had not served.“The more diversity of opinion at the table the more consensus you can build the more sustainability of the solutions and the more respect it commands” Pelosi said of her efforts to advance women and minorities into leadership.There will be now be 42 African Americans in the House and one in the Senate — Scott the first black Republican in the Senate since 1979.Two of the Senate’s three Hispanics will be Republicans (Cruz and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida). Sen. Robert Menendez (N.J.) is a Democrat.But of the 29 Latinos in the House 24 are Democrats. In opening-day speeches to the House by Pelosi and Boehner only the Democratic leader mentioned the need for comprehensive immigration reform to a standing ovation from Democrats and temperate applause from a handful of Republicans.Democrats see tangible political advantages in their diversity.“Part of our happiness is that we know the wind’s behind us” said Rep. Raul M. Grijalva (Ariz.) explaining enthusiasm from Democrats on Thursday. “Obama’s victory is owed to that demographic and you see more of that happening here especially in our party. And you’re going to see more of it going forward.”Meanwhile the spirit among Republicans — who are still smarting from a divisive vote late Tuesday for legislation that will allow taxes to rise for the wealthiest Americans — was more muted.For Pelosi the growing number of female lawmakers has been a source of particular pride. The gains came in a year when Democrats campaigned aggressively on women’s issues.“We’re a little past the time where people are pioneers” Pelosi said. “We’re not just going out there and saying we want women to vote for us. We’re saying we want to give women a seat at the table and you know what? A seat at the head of the table.”Half of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s “red to blue” candidates recruited to run in competitive districts that Republicans held were women. Pelosi hosted women’s fundraising lunches nationwide and ultimately saw the number of Democratic women expand even in a year when Republican numbers dropped from 24 to 20.“She was tireless. She would do four events in a day” said newly elected Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) an Iraq war veteran who took a position of honor next to Pelosi during a class photo of Democratic women taken on the Capitol steps on Thursday. “We were working hard. But she was working just as hard around the country for us.”The women say their increased numbers could inject civility into a bitter and gridlocked process.“By and large they understand that extremism — whether it’s on women’s issues or fiscal issues — we’re not going to make progress if they’re on the far ends the fringe” said Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) who was reelected in November after her Republican opponent claimed that pregnancies rarely result from “legitimate rape.”“We’ve got to find that middle where we can all be a little unhappy but we can actually get something done” she said.Ed O’Keefe contributed to this report.",1
63,The Justice Department on Monday sued North Carolina over the state’s restrictive new voting law which requires photo identification for in-person voting and cuts back on early voting and same-day registration — all of which will disproportionately affect black voters. The suit which follows similar litigation against Texas is the latest effort by the department to go after voting discrimination in the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling in June striking down part of the Voting Rights Act.Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. called the North Carolina law “an intentional attempt to break a system that was working” and he said that it was clearly intended to discriminate on the basis of race.But North Carolina and Texas represent only one front in the continuing battle to protect voting rights. Twenty years after Congress passed the “motor voter” law to make it easier for Americans to register to vote numerous states keep trying to make it harder relying on vague and dubious claims of voter fraud to push through misguided and harmful legislation.The 1993 law formally known as the National Voter Registration Act established a uniform federal form that requires only that voters attest under penalty of perjury that they are citizens. The form which states must “accept and use” when people apply for a driver’s license has helped millions of Americans register to vote.,0

65,"But here is the real problem:But after the difficulty he had this weekend getting a proper ID card Wright 90 expressed concern that such problems could deter others from voting and stifle turnout. After spending much of his life fighting to make it easier to vote the Democratic Party icon said he is troubled by what he’s seeing happen under the state’s new voter ID law. “I earnestly hope these unduly stringent requirements on voters won’t dramatically reduce the number of people who vote” Wright told the Star-Telegram. “I think they will reduce the number to some extent.” Wright and his assistant Norma Ritchson went to the DPS office on Woodway Drive to get a State of Texas Election Identification Certificate. Wright said he realized earlier in the week that the photo identifications he had — a Texas driver’s license that expired in 2010 and a TCU faculty ID — do not satisfy requirements of the voter ID law enacted in 2011 by the Legislature. DPS officials concurred.We want to make sure that every eligible Texan who wants to cast a ballot can” Pierce said. “We want to help any Texan who needs additional information."" Wright who said he has voted in every election since 1944 lamented that such help is called for. “From my youth I have tried to expand the elections” Wright said. “I pushed to abolish the poll tax. I was the first to come out for lowering the voting age to 18.”Not everyone will have the resources or knowledge that Wright has to overcome these obstacles. And Wright puts it very well:The state put up these obstacles in the first place- now they are 'concerned' to make sure everyone can overcome them. They have 'solved' non-existent voter fraud problems by creating actual problems.For help with getting Voter ID the linked article suggests:For more information voters may call the Texas secretary of state's office at 800-252-VOTE (8683) or the Tarrant County Elections Office at 817-831-VOTE (8683).

66,"WASHINGTON -- The Michigan Republican Party is seeking to increase its visibility in Democratic- and minority-heavy Detroit and last week it brought Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) to the city to open the party's African-American Engagement Office. But if anything the launch event put into stark relief just how much work the GOP has to do when a largely white audience turned out to hear the senator speak.Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus has said that attracting more minorities to the GOP is crucial for the party's future. He visited Michigan last month hired radio personality Wayne Bradley to head the African-American Engagement effort in the state and launched the Michigan Black Advisory Council.In the 2012 election President Barack Obama earned the support of 90 percent of the black voters who turned out at the polls.Paul initially spoke at the new African-American Engagement Office on Livernois Avenue in Detroit for about four minutes on Friday. According to the progressive site Eclectablog ""The seats in the tiny space were filled with well-dressed supporters most of whom were African-American.""“Today’s opening of this office is the beginning of a new Republican Party” Paul said. “This is going to be a Republican Party that is in big cities and small cities in the countryside in the city. It’s going to be about bringing a message that is popular no matter where you’re from whether you're rich or poor whether you’re black white or brown.”Paul then went to a larger grassroots event at the Grace Bible Chapel where there were protesters from the civil rights group National Action Network outside. The online invitation said the event was intended to ""celebrate the opening of our African-American Engagement Office in Detroit.""Tracking footage from the Democratic super PAC American Bridge 21st Century however shows an overwhelmingly white audience ended up turning out:Detroit is approximately 83 percent African-American.Paul also spoke Friday at the Detroit Economic Club where he proposed a plan to revitalize U.S. cities through the creation of ""economic freedom zones"" which would cut federal taxes in communities that have an unemployment rate of 12 percent or higher.The Michigan Democratic Party rejected Paul's advice for Detroit.""Sen. Paul was a vocal opponent of the auto rescue which saved over a million jobs and led the Republican effort to shut down the government costing Michigan's economy hundreds of millions"" said party spokesman Joshua Pugh. ""His special interest tax handout plan is nothing new. Here in Michigan Rick Snyder gave $1.8 billion to wealthy special interests and paid for it with billions in devastating cuts to our local communities and public schools. It's time for our elected leaders to stop the tax giveaways invest in communities and improve education.""Paul has been trying to do more minority outreach in recent months. In April Paul spoke at the historically black Howard University becoming the first Republican elected official to speak on campus in years.Still he continues to generate skepticism in part due to his criticism of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. In 2010 he said ""I think it’s a bad business decision to exclude anybody from your restaurant but at the same time I do believe in private ownership.""On Sunday Paul said he opposed extending long-term unemployment benefits because doing so would be a ""disservice"" to workers. African-Americans have consistently had a significantly higher unemployment rate than whites.Neither Paul nor the Michigan GOP returned a request for comment.PHOTO GALLERY Rand Paul Speaks At African American Outreach Event In Detroit",1
67,WASHINGTON — After pushing through one of the most significant rule changes in Senate history Majority Leader Harry Reid struck a solemn tone: “This is not a time for celebration.”But behind closed doors in a room off the Senate floor some of the newer Democratic senators couldn’t help themselves gathering for a quick party to congratulate one another. They were the ones largely responsible for pushing the veteran Nevada lawmaker to pull the trigger on ending filibusters against most presidential nominations.The partisan revelers were part of a new breed of Democrats emerging in the Senate. Mostly elected after 2006 these relative newcomers have only known a Democratic-controlled Senate and have little experience with successful bipartisan cooperation due largely to the tea party’s grip on the Republican Party.Now they are hoping to become a new power center in the party nudging the old guard to adopt more aggressive tactics in pursuit of legislative goals and largely brushing aside Republican threats of retaliation and obstruction. They see the rules and traditions of the Senate as having stifled the will of the majority and stalled President Obama’s agenda.Advertisement“The Senate is a graveyard for good ideas” Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) who along with Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon led the filibuster reform effort and won over veteran colleagues in a body where seniority was once the most valuable currency.PHOTOS: 2013’s memorable political momentsThis newer class of Democrats came to Washington not unlike the tea party Republicans with a strong commitment to their ideals and policy goals. But while the tea party rule in the House has been characterized by attempts to stifle the president’s agenda Democrats see their goal as helping to implement it.Thursday’s action to limit the use of filibusters — seen as so drastic it was termed the “nuclear option” — shows they are willing to carve out a different path to get there.Advertisement“There’s a time to reach across the aisle and there’s a time to hold the line” said Sen. Christopher S. Murphy (D-Conn.) the body’s youngest member at 40 who was elected in 2012. “And I think so far this year Democrats in the Senate have done a very good job of mixing across-the-aisle compromise with some heretofore unseen spine-stiffening.”The time has come for Democrats to take a harder stance against the tea party Republicans he said.“These folks have come to Washington to destroy government from within and will use any tool at their disposal” Murphy said. “To the extent that we have the ability to take tools away from the tea party we should do it. And one of the tools was the filibuster. Another was the belief that Democrats would cave in the face of another shutdown or debt default.”For Murphy the failure of the Senate gun control bill earlier this year was the final straw. He took on the issue of gun violence after the Newtown school shooting in his state in 2012. A bipartisan bill crafted by Sens. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) had 55 votes but failed to advance.Advertisement“I was a proponent of filibuster reform coming into the Senate but I became a revolutionary on this issue when we lost the gun bill” Murphy said.The group also includes Elizabeth Warren elected last fall in Massachusetts. Her firebrand style and unabashed liberalism have energized the party’s left wing.The senators’ influence has already been seen in other fights most recently in the 16-day shutdown when new Democrats lobbied party leaders to stand up to Republicans — a tactic that seemed to shock many on the other side of the aisle who were betting that Democrats would blink first.Next on their agenda is extending the filibuster rule change from presidential appointments to legislation which would enable the Senate to move on issues including gun control and climate change.AdvertisementPHOTOS: The battle over ObamacareAt times their advocacy has presented challenges to the administration. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) elected in 2006 circulated a letter among his colleagues urging the president to appoint Janet Yellen — not Lawrence H. Summers — as Federal Reserve chair because Summers’ banking policies were viewed as having contributed to the financial meltdown. About a third of the party including Merkley and Warren signed it. Yellen is now on track to take the post after advancing this week from the Senate Banking Committee with Brown and Warren’s support.And Senate confirmation is virtually assured thanks to the new rule change against filibusters.“The Elizabeth Warren wing of the Democratic Party definitely are showing that they have growing influence in the caucus and in government in general” said Matt Wall of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee a group that works to promote progressive candidates and issues in Democratic primaries. On Friday Warren circulated a fundraising letter to supporters on behalf of Merkley and Udall thanking them for their role in changing the rule. Both men face reelection in 2014.AdvertisementThe changing Democratic tactics may reflect a generational shift occurring in the Senate. It’s almost certain that by the start of the next Congress in 2015 more than half of the Democratic caucus will have been elected since 2008 when gridlock reached new heights. But nine of the new Senate Democrats are former Congress members all of whom served at least part of their time under Republican majorities. Three were governors who served with Republican legislatures.The shift among Democrats has at times confounded Republicans particularly on the filibuster issue. Aides to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) the third-longest-serving Republican said they had felt that Reid’s most recent moves telegraphing the nuclear option were a bluff.Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Thursday railed against the actions of “uninitiated newcomers in the Democratic caucus” reminding them they had never served in the minority in the Senate. Those who have a longer memory “should know better” he added.Six-term Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan was the only Democrat to speak out against his party’s move citing the late institutionalist Sens. Edward M. Kennedy and Robert C. Byrd in arguing against tinkering with long-standing rules.Advertisement“Before we discard the uniqueness of this great institution let us use the current rules and precedents of the Senate to end the abuse of the filibuster” said Levin who will retire after next year.But those pushing for the rule change won over one Democratic stalwart.“There are many of us that really wanted to keep things the way they were because that’s the way they were” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). “One thing I know: that you learn from history. And right now we can’t let the present be the future. So you’ve got to make the change or this becomes a body that doesn’t mutate.”Reid’s thinking has also evolved. When Merkley as a prospective candidate first met with Reid ahead of the 2008 election he told the leader that filibuster reform was one of his top priorities. Reid put his head in his hands a Merkley aide recalled. “It’s not about the filibuster” Reid admonished the younger man. “It’s about the culture. We’ve got to change the culture.”AdvertisementSix years later the culture is the same and the filibuster is gone.michael.memoli@latimes.comTwitter: @mikememoli,0
68,"At the end of the tape the man who was asked to leave goes on to say . . .""I'm trying to understand how come there's no black people here. I'm trying to figure out why the outreach of the GOP and especially CPAC is not working with black citizens and I have yet to find an answer only I get all I've gotten is abrasive attitudes and people yelling because I guess I ask the tough question just ask the simple question where's the inclusion? Where are the black people? I don't know why that is so offensive?""I disagree with the gentleman who was asked to leave no 'outreach' is every going to work with this broken farce of a GOP. The GOP can not astroturf minorities on stage and think that will win them minority voters in the ballot box because they are still selling them same product Mitt Romney couldn't sell with all the money in the world behind him and even if they did wouldn't GOP efforts to make voting harder for those same minorities negate that? There is a reason the GOP or CPAC or any of the other wingnut outfits can't win over anyone other than screaming white guys who cheered George W Bush on and suddenly got pissed off when President Obama was first inaugurated. The incestuous amplification of white Republicans telling white Republicans that race no longer matters only works on white Republicans the root of the problem is that the entire GOP as a structure is rooted around demonizing everyone who isn't white or privileged and that by nature excludes everyone else. I mean it's hard to put 'Mr. Obama is a Kenyan Trump' on stage and then wonder why you can't win black people.I guess you don't have to be a poor demented honky to vote Republican but it helps.The floor is now yours . . .Surprise the white guy screaming in this video is a Brietbart hack check out the diary posted by bluebarnstormer http://www.dailykos.com/...Another note Republicans have convinced themselves that there is no racism for the same reasons they claim there is no such thing as Global warming or that the problem is that we don't have enough guns on the street Republicans pretend these problems don't exist and take offense if you claim they do because Conservatives and their wealthy financial backers are the chief beneficiaries of racism and pollution and the flooding of America with high power war rifles. Saying racism doesn't exist then allows you to turn a blind eye to it because of course it doesn't exist so what's the problem. That is why Republicans tell themselves that black people would only vote GOP if they really knew what the GOP was about. As if that isn't insulting.If they admit the problem exists they have to offer a solution so they don't. Instead they insist that the problem of racism pollution and other things don't exist at all unlike socialism.And there you have it. Republicans can't admit racism exists because they are the sole beneficiaries of it keeping poor white people voting for rich white people is only possible if the strawman of the Sherriff is black.And the media will never state that because they are owned by the corporations who stand to gain the most if Republican racism remains the Elephant in the Room pardon the pun.Magical thinking doesn't fix these problems. And magical thinking is all the GOP has left that and fear./peace",0
69,"Politically speaking the president is right. The longer the immigration debate drags on the lower the odds it will culminate in a bill on his desk.Here's why.Every day that goes by is a day closer to the 2014 midterm elections. And the months leading up to Election Day are a time for lawmakers to campaign raise money and do everything they can to hold on to their jobs. It's not a time for a contentious legislative debate that could complicate the fall campaign.Story continues below advertisementThat's why history has shown that little gets done legislatively right before the election. Members are in their districts and states more and more often and less and less willing to take risks in Congress.AdvertisementAnd immigration reform is a risky proposition for many House Republicans. Despite national polls showing the public largely in favor of overhauling the nation's laws the calculus is often different back home. This is in large part why months after the Senate passed a sweeping bipartisan immigration bill the House has yet to act.But that doesn't mean it won't. Republicans have already moved ahead on some piecemeal measures. And House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said Wednesday that he was ""hopeful"" something could get done by the end of the year.Story continues below advertisementComing off a fiscal battle that badly damaged the Republican brand there is arguably more political incentive for Boehner to act on immigration than there has been in the past.

[...] “I’m not going to do anything now precipitously” he said. “But I’m looking at this very closely…. We’re going to fill that job. Cordray is there now. He’s going to get a vote.” Reid wasn’t able to explain why he believes (or claims to believe) Cordray will ultimately be confirmed. But he alluded to the possibility that he may pursue a rules change mid-session. “Whether it’s Jeb Bush or Hillary Clinton that’s the next president I don’t think they should have to go through what we’ve gone through here” Reid said. “People better watch.”Does Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid mean it this time? Is he really setting the stage for doing filibuster reform mid-session? We've heard the threats plenty of times before but he seems to be pushing a tiny bit more this time by scheduling a vote on Richard Cordray's nomination to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for next week. This could be interpreted as his effort to make the case for going nuclear to his caucus.The Cordray nomination is a good one to use if Reid wants to make a point. It's the most high-profile and public and egregious of Republican filibusters. The vast majority of the GOP caucus 43 senators signed a letter to President Obama declaring that they would oppose any nominee he might put forward for the job because they don't think the agency should exist. With this filibuster they are in essence nullifying a chunk of Dodd-Frank that they disagree with that is nonetheless the law of the land.That's a big deal a very big deal.

Steve King R-Iowa Steve Stockman R-Texas and Michele Bachmann R-Minn. on Wednesday night to rally opponents to mobilize for the August recess.Beck said there were 40000 people on the call.""Obviously they've got all of this money and all of these organizations and everything else but we've got over 2 million members. We're in every district"" Beck said. ""And they've got a tough road to hoe. They've got to change representatives' minds. We're more in a situation of needing to hold people. It's always better to try to hold people to a position.""GOP leaders said Republicans are looking forward to facing voters on the issue.""Our members will be well-prepared to talk with constituents about this important issue"" said Nate Hodson a spokesman for Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers R-Wash. chairwoman of the House Republican Conference.House committees have passed five immigration-related bills that focus on enhancing border security providing visas for high-tech and agricultural workers and enhancing the ability of state and local law enforcement to enforce immigration laws.The Senate bill allows the nation's unauthorized immigrants to apply for U.S. citizenship adds $46 billion to secure the border and revamps nearly every other portion of the nation's immigration laws.Supporters of an overhaul of immigration laws say House Republicans are focusing too much on border security and not on a pathway to citizenship for the nation's undocumented immigrants which is a focus of the Senate plan.On Monday Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is scheduled to give a pro-immigration speech at the premier of the film Documented which was directed by Jose Antonio Vargas an immigration activist. A group of religious leaders will take a bus tour through Republican districts in the Midwest.Clarissa Martinez of the National Council of La Raza which supports legalization of all unauthorized immigrants said a coalition of groups will host 360 different events in 52 congressional districts around the country during the recess.Meanwhile some Republican donors and business groups will try to influence GOP members as well.Republicans for Immigration Reform a group formed by former GOP Commerce secretary Carlos Gutierrez sent a letter with other GOP donors this week to members of the House urging passage of a bill. Charlie Spies a former fundraiser for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney said that was an attempt to add to the ""grass-roots"" approach by swaying members with their ""grasstops"" approach.""We're going to focus on engagement with constituents and business leaders who have actual relationships with members"" Spies said. ""You won't see us busing people in to town halls.""Republicans such as King say the border must be secured first before people in the USA illegally are offered citizenship. And some Tea Party affiliates plan to make sure representatives hear from the opponents to what they say is an ""amnesty"" for people who broke the law to be here.""It's not a battle that we picked"" said Tea Party Patriots co-founder Jenny Beth Martin referring to her group's typical focus on government spending.""It isn't an issue that was even on the front burner for us. But because of what the Senate has done and the House is now doing it's something that we have to pay attention to.""Martin said her group is working closely with NumbersUSA and others to hold rallies attend town-hall-style forums and ensure that Republican members of Congress know the opposition they'll face if they support any kind of immigration reform they don't approve of.""We've said all along that we're going to hold people accountable"" Martin said. ""We're holding them accountable.""",1

74,Story highlights Not everyone is a fan though Mayor Bloomberg vows to help with the transition Biracial family of New York Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio influences his campaign Increasing visibility of de Blasio clan resonates with New Yorkers(CNN) —Throughout Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio’s campaign for New York’s top political act his backup band seemed to overshadow the headliner.His son Dante a sophomore at a public high school in Brooklyn appeared prominently in campaign ads his soaring Afro a topic of conversation in political circles. Daughter Chiara a college freshman out-danced the rest of the telegenic family at the West Indian Day Parade with a move they called “The Smackdown.”Watch the de Blasios dance “The Smackdown”A virtual unknown nationally despite 25 years in New York politics de Blasio defied critics who questioned whether his experience as a city councilman from Brooklyn and most recently as public advocate – a sort of civic watchdog – sufficiently prepared him to run the Big Apple. He also ran Hillary Clinton’s first U.S. Senate campaign.But his biracial family’s increasing visibility resonated with residents of a city coping with a 21% poverty rate and increasing racial divisiveness brought on by the controversial “stop-and-frisk” policy allowing police to search people in high-crime areas.“His family just because of the racial mix represents a big and increasingly large part of the city and speaks to certain sensibilities” said Harold Ickes a veteran Democratic Party operative who advised the campaign and has known de Blasio for two decades. “The family is very important to Bill… From the outside this family represents a part of the city not represented in city government.”The de Blasio clan was featured prominently in commercials and campaign events. Dante then 15 appeared in his own ad over the summer that highlighted his father’s stance against “stop-and-frisk.” Dante and his hair immediately became a social media sensation – and de Blasio began to surge in the polls.In addition Chirlane McCray a political activist who once identified herself as lesbian before marrying de Blasio emerged as a top campaign strategist.5 things to know about New York’s new mayorDeBlasio 52 portrayed himself as the “unapologetically progressive alternative to the Bloomberg era” saying that the current mayor’s polices favor the rich. He repeatedly used the Dickensian phrase “a tale of two cities” to describe New York City under billionaire Mayor Michael Bloomberg.The wealth inequality message appeared to have struck home with minority and low-income voters on Tuesday giving de Blasio an advantage over Republican candidate Joe Lhota among black and Latino voters compared to white voters.“The city is much more racially mixed than when Bloomberg took office” Ickes said. “A lot of people having a hard time economically are black Hispanic and Asian and Bill spoke elegantly to that.”De Blasio’s critics accused him of dividing the city along economic and racial lines and credited “stop-and-frisk” with a sharp crime reduction during Bloomberg’s tenure.Appearing on CNN’s The Lead with Jake Tapper on Wednesday Bloomberg said he had a meeting with de Blasio and vowed to help with the transition.“Keep in mind I have a big vested interest in making Bill de Blasio an even better mayor than I was” Bloomberg said. “We built a lot. We’ve given them a lot to work with… But the bottom line is I’m going to live in New York City and I want Bill de Blasio’s administration to be successful and our administration to do everything to transfer everything we’ve been doing over.”De Blasio who has a bachelor’s degree from New York University and a master’s in international and public affairs from Columbia University met McCray while working in the administration of David Dinkins the city’s first black mayor.When de Blasio delivered his acceptance speech late on Election Day he was surrounded like most of the campaign by his family.The strapping politician the first Democratic mayor in the largely-Democratic city in two decades hugged son and daughter and planted a firm kiss on the lips of his wife before going on to thank the many people behind his triumph.“The people I’m most grateful to and most grateful for are standing next to me” he said amid cheers and applause. “My partner in life my best friend in the world: she is brilliant and every bit as compassionate as she is tough the love of my life Chirlane McCray.”He added “Of everything I have to feel fortunate about I am most lucky most blessed to be the father of two extraordinary children: Chiara and Dante. They make me proud every single day. And my fellow New Yorkers they are very stylish.”De Blasio greeted his supporters in both Spanish and Italian. McCray introduced him: “From our family to your family I give you the next mayor of New York City.”,0
75,"The Kansas secretary of state announced Wednesday that he and his Arizona counterpart are suing the federal government in an effort to ensure that anyone registering to vote shows proof of citizenship.A lawsuit filed by Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) and Arizona Secretary of State Ken Bennett (R) asks that the United States Election Assistance Commission include state-specific requirements for proof of citizenship on all federal voter registration forms in the two states the Kansas City Star reported.In June the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Arizona's law allowing proof of citizenship requirements on state forms unconstitutional since federal forms did not require it. But the court also said that states with proof of citizenship requirements could ask the federal government to note those requirements on federal registration forms distributed in their states.The recent lawsuit comes days after the American Civil Liberties Union told Kobach that it intended to sue him over the state requirement citing 15000 voter registrations being held up due to lack of proof. But Kobach said his suit could preempt the ACLU suit since it addresses the ACLU's concerns the Topeka Capitol-Journal reports.Doug Bonney the legal director for the ACLU of Kansas and Western Missouri told The Huffington Post that Kobach and Bennett's lawsuit was expected. At the same time Bonney said he disagrees with Kobach's analysis that this will end his group's lawsuit to overturn the Kansas law.Bonney said that citizens are not able to register to vote because they cannot display proof of citizenship or because of bureaucratic issues. He said laws requiring people to attest to being citizens when registering to vote have worked well to prevent fraud.""There is no proof of people fraudulently registering to vote"" Bonney said. ""For scores of years the attestation requirement has been perfectly find. This law makes it difficult for those who are citizens to vote because they cannot get properly registered.""Kobach a tea party favorite who has written controversial immigration laws in Arizona and Alabama said that the citizenship proof is needed. ""Every time an alien votes it effectively cancels out the vote of a U.S. citizen"" Kobach said at the press conference on Wednesday.Opponents of the citizenship requirement told The Huffington Post that the suit is ""fear mongering"" and unnecessary. Former Kansas state Rep. Ann Mah (D-Topeka) Kobach's most vocal critic said that she is not surprised by the suit. At the same time she stressed that every voter fraud investigation in Kansas has turned up minimal cases in the last decade. She said the real problem is the 15000 voter registrations being held up.""There is no evidence out there at all"" Mah told HuffPost. ""Why do we have 15000 Americans who can't vote because of the hoops they have to jump through?""She said that since most voters register at state motor vehicle offices which are not equipped to process birth certificates to meet the state law voters would need to also visit an election office to complete the process.Arizona state House Minority Leader Chad Campbell (D-Phoenix) told HuffPost that he believes this is a way for Bennett to draw tea party votes for his 2014 Republican gubernatorial primary. Campbell who is seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination agreed with Mah that there is no voter fraud in the state.""We've gone down this road time and time again we hear about all this supposed fraud from the tea party all the time"" he said. ""Every analysis shows there is no voter fraud taking place. It is political grandstanding and fear mongering from the tea party movement.""",0
76,"Let's not let revisionism discolor what this was really all about. In it's letter of Secession which was sent immediately after the Election of President Abraham Lincoln even before he took Office Texas stated the following:We hold as undeniable truths that the governments of the various States and of the confederacy itself were established exclusively by the white race for themselves and their posterity; that the African race had no agency in their establishment; that they were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race and in that condition only could their existence in this country be rendered beneficial or tolerable. That in this free government all white men are and of right ought to be entitled to equal civil and political rights [emphasis in the original]; that the servitude of the African race as existing in these States is mutually beneficial to both bond and free and is abundantly authorized and justified by the experience of mankind and the revealed will of the Almighty Creator as recognized by all Christian nations; while the destruction of the existing relations between the two races as advocated by our sectional enemies would bring inevitable calamities upon both and desolation upon the fifteen slave-holding statesIt was merely theof a President from a Party that endorsed Abolition even if that President at the time DID NOT make accomplishing that party of his platform or an agenda item of his administration - that drove the South in ato begin to dismantle the nation State by State.And now today we see more and more Tea Partiers - while also overreacting to an election they lost - slowly endorsing the legitimacy of a new secession and further - of ABSOLUTE rights of the BUSINESS OWNER over their EMPLOYEES (as well as CLIENTS) in everything from denying them a living wage and working conditions to Dictating Whether they can have access to Preventive Services in their HealthCare impose llfetime caps and openly discriminate against those who had the temerity to previously GET SICK.Apparently Modern Confederate Tea Partiers think the cruelty of that system is just ""Fine"".Wither is Freedom then eh?In the last few years there have been a rising of Pro-Confederacy Groups who've written such amazing revisionist history such as this.Southerners have less reason to be loyal to the collective enterprise that is the United States than does any group of citizens. The South was Invaded laid waste and conquered when it tried to uphold the original and correct meaning of the Declaration of Independance and the Constitution.Yeah right the South was """" - so much for those pesky letters of Secesion and that little Ft Sumter thing. Sure.And this happened merely because they felt they had the economic Right to continue practices such as this.Slavery was Evil. It was pure Economic Evil. Human Cruelty for Wealth and Profit. The Confederates were trying to Protect and Continue that system of Cruelty of The THEFT of Freedom Free Will and Choice for their own enrichment.But this is what they are what they've always been. They know it in their hearts and this is why they truly FEAR - deeply in their bones - an African American President such as Barack Obama. It is beyond their comprehension that he isn't racked with a deep desire for Vengence against Whites.How could it not be?It was this type of deep atavistic fear that even affected Barack Obama's own grandmother Toot. In his bookhe recounts how his grandmother while working in Texas following WWII had befriended a black janitor Mr. Reed who worked in the same building. They had a cordial friendship yet another - white - secretary working in the building proceeded to angrily scold them both for their familiarity telling Toot she should never ever ""call no'Mister'"".Years later in Hawaii when Barack was a boy living with his grandparents to attend High School in the U.S. while his mother worked overseas his grandmother encountered a particularly aggressive beggar who frightened her. A black beggar. Despite knowing the character of Barack's father and of Barack himself - she was still terrified of him because she knew and had seen in Texas the kind of cruel mis-treatment people like him had received. She had a understanding of the righteous anger that that person could potentially feel and she feared it.That beggar was not Mr. Reed. But another 20 years later it very well could have been - and he would have be duly justified in his outrage. Gramps - Toot's husband - angrily scolded her for her reaction to the beggar his feeling had always been the individuals are individuals not some collective mass of angst not some open racial sore that refuses to be healed. For all of this Barack had a ring-side seat. He witnessed both Yin and Yang.Unlike Toot who was sympathetic to those who suffered from bigotry identified with their outrage - and recognized it's legitimacy - what the Modern Tea Party-Confederate feels is something worse.Guilt!No not their own personal guilt but the collective guilt of centuries of cruelty. They constantly try to wipe it away ignore it deflect it disguise it but it continues to come right back because they in their own heart of hearts simply don't believe that any Nigger should ever EVER be called ""Mr. President"".It's fear driven by that guilt that also drove the Confederates as it drives the Tea Party and now- the Republican Party.So of course they have to Do Anything Necessary to prevent this cruel retribution from being inflicted on the Good White people... um I mean the American People. They have to SHUTDOWN THE GOVERNMENT because that is the limited leverage they have with a majority in the House.They have to rail that Obamacare is a Complete and Total Failure even as Hundreds of Thousands successfully send in their applications despite initial website glitches and are finding they can get better care for far less than they were previously spending.They have to DENY Reality again and again and again.Obama was never a Slave. None of his Ancestors on his father's side were Slaves. Most of what he knows about what it means to be historically ""Black In America"" came from his White Grandparents and their experiences during the 40's and the 50's as recounted to him. He has studied Langston Hughes and Baldwin and W.E.B. Debois to better understand the ""Black Experience"". He lived it within his own skin in LA whlie attending Occidental College in New York while working for a Non-Profit in Chicago working with communities to help incrimentally improve their lives. He's seen it from just about every possible angle and he's not racked with AngerHe's not driven to seek Devine Retribution against the Ills of the White Race.ObamaCare is not Punishment for the Wickedness of Long Dead White People. Some of those White people going all the way back to the Revolutionary War are his own Ancestors.Obama is not a Kenyan. Not a Socialist. Not a Muslim. Not a Mau Mau Anti-Colonialist. Not a Fist Pumping Black Power Enthusiast. He's not Mr. Reed nor is he the Beggar.He's our American President. He's doing the best he can under his power to improve the lives of All American Citizens. As did President Lincoln before him.Some day the Tea Party-Confederates will learn that lesson. But apparently not today.Vyan",0
77,Backed by throngs of chanting supporters dozens of liberal demonstrators are subjecting themselves to arrest each Monday at the state legislature here to protest a flurry of bills that could transform North Carolina into a model of conservative governance.The state’s hard turn to the right comes less than five years after people took to the streets here to celebrate the 2008 victory of Barack Obama the first Democratic presidential candidate to capture the state since Jimmy Carter in 1976. The win prompted Obama’s supporters to crow about the growing influence of progressive and minority voters not only in North Carolina but across the South.But that euphoria is now a distant memory. Since the recession hit North Carolina has been saddled with one of the nation’s highest unemployment rates. The bad times helped prepare the way for a carefully executed strategy with big financial support from a major conservative activist that helped the GOP win control of both chambers of the state General Assembly in 2010.Those victories were capped last year when Republican Pat McCrory was elected governor giving the party control of all levers of state government for the first time since 1870.The victories were aided by the strong financial support of Art Pope a multimillionaire who spent heavily in support of the state’s GOP candidates. The Institute for Southern Studies a North Carolina-based research organization said Pope’s advocacy network spent $2.2 million on 22 legislative races winning 18. Overall conservative organizations largely supported by Pope accounted for three-fourths of the outside money spent in North Carolina legislative races in 2010 according to the institute.One of McCrory’s first acts after being elected governor was to install Pope a former legislator as the state budget chief. (The governor’s office declined to make Pope available for an interview.) And now GOP lawmakers are moving swiftly to enact a long list of legislation they say is largely aimed at limiting government debt and snapping the state’s economy out of a years-long malaise.Legislators have slashed jobless benefits. They have also repealed a tax credit that supplemented the wages of low-income people while moving to eliminate the estate tax. They have voted against expanding Medicaid to comply with the 2010 federal health-care law. The expansion would have added 500000 poor North Carolinians to the Medicaid rolls.“Before considering Medicaid expansion we must reform the current system to make sure people currently enrolled receive the services they need and more taxpayer dollars are not put at risk” McCrory said in a written statement after signing a bill blocking the expansion.Lawmakers are also considering proposals to reduce and flatten income tax rates while expanding the sales tax perhaps to even include groceries and prescription drugs — which some advocates see as a first step toward eliminating the state income tax.“North Carolina is a high-income-tax state and we’re suffering the consequences” said Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger (R). “Our unemployment rate is the fifth worst in the country and our high tax rates are hindering economic growth and pushing jobs to our neighbors.”There are also measures pending to require drug testing for low-income people applying for job training and welfare benefits.Other GOP-controlled legislatures have passed or considered similar measures in the wake of the recession. Florida Missouri and Michigan are among the states that have slashed jobless benefits. Texas Louisiana and Wisconsin are among at least 15 states not participating in the Medicaid expansion called for in the Affordable Care Act. And West Virginia Kansas and Texas are among the states where legislators have proposed bills requiring drug testing for welfare recipients.The North Carolina House has passed a law requiring voters to have a government-issued identification card and legislators are considering bills to roll back the state’s law allowing same-day voter registration and to sharply limit early voting — measures that supporters of the current law say were integral to the high turnout of minority voters in the past several elections.“I don’t know that there is a state that has as many regressive policies on tap” said Penda Hair co-director of Advancement Project a Washington-based civil rights group that is considering a lawsuit challenging changes to the state’s voting laws.Liberals may be up in arms but North Carolina conservatives are applauding the new direction of the General Assembly. After the state Senate unveiled its tax reform plan this month the state chapter of Americans for Prosperity released a poll that it said showed widespread support across the state. Nearly two-thirds of respondents said the state tax code is in need of reform and nearly half backed moving to totally eliminate the personal income tax within four years.“The poll results show a clear desire for bold tax relief and reform that gets North Carolina back in the game for jobs and business” said Dallas Woodhouse state director of Americans for Prosperity in North Carolina.The legislative effort has mobilized liberals who see North Carolina as a laboratory for conservative ideas propelled nationwide by the money of a handful of key patrons. They note that many of the initiatives being pursued by legislators here have long been championed by a network of conservative organizations supported by Pope and billionaire activists Charles and David Koch including Americans for Prosperity and the American Legislative Exchange Council.“Most of the laws that take us backwards do not come out of Congress but out of state legislatures” said the Rev. William J. Barber II head of the North Carolina chapter of the NAACP. “Conservative forces here have gone all out to implement these policies and to lock in their power by changing the voting laws.”In an effort that resurrects some of the tactics of the civil rights movement Barber has led a growing multiracial campaign of civil disobedience intended to draw attention to the changes being pursued by legislators.This past week more than 600 demonstrators some waving placards and singing freedom songs gathered outside the North Carolina Legislative Building for the fourth “Moral Mondays” protest.With the crowd behind them 57 protesters walked inside the building and stood in front of the large brass doors leading to the Senate chamber. The demonstrators — pastors students college professors and senior citizens among them — were arrested and led away in plastic handcuffs. They joined a group of more than 100 North Carolina residents who had been arrested and jailed in three previous protests.“This leadership wants to make our state a place of deeper stratification and inequality” Barber said.In the coming weeks Barber plans to move the protests from the doorstep of the legislature to the home districts of the lawmakers through a series of 25 town meetings.But as it stands there is very little opponents can do to alter the will of the governing majority — something many of the protesters acknowledge.“My hope is two-pronged” said Derick Smith an instructor at North Carolina A&T University who was arrested several weeks ago during a protest. “You want to bring attention to what’s happening. And you’ve got to hope that the governor will listen and back away from some of the more divisive provisions.”,1
78,Our 50 states seem to be united in name only.In fact we seem to be increasingly becoming two countries under one flag: Liberal Land — coastal urban and multicultural — separated by Conservative Country — Southern and Western rural and racially homogeneous. (Other parts of the country are a bit of a mixed bag.)This has led to incredible and disturbing concentrations of power.As The New York Times reported after the election in November more than two-thirds of the states are now under single-party control meaning that one party has control of the governor’s office and has majorities in both legislative chambers.This is the highest level of such control since 1952. And Republicans have single-party control in nearly twice as many states as Democrats.This is having very real consequences on the ground nowhere more clearly than on the subjects of voting rights and women’s reproductive rights.,0

Cook charts two eras in the modern history of presidential politics one Republican and the other Democratic. Republicans dominated the period from 1968 until 1992. Democrats have been the dominant presidential party since then.But she has strayed from many in her party with her desire for expanded background checks and a ban on military-style weapons.

80,They cited in particular his concerns about the Police Department’s stop-and-frisk practice which critics say discriminates against blacks and Hispanics and his advocacy for legislation to require that many businesses offer paid time off to sick employees.Even though candidates prize endorsements from labor unions their value is hard to determine. In the past many unions have sided with losing candidates and in mayoral campaigns especially union members may vote in accordance with their own political instincts rather than hewing to the recommendations of their union. But this year with all of the Democratic candidates vowing to participate in a public financing system with relatively low spending limits labor’s support could be crucial.The leaders of 1199 vowed to work harder than they have for any other local candidate in many years to help Mr. de Blasio win and said they were considering participating in a “super PAC” to spend money on the race. “We wanted to send a strong signal: De Blasio was so far ahead of everyone else it was really a race to the bottom” Mr. Gresham said.Mr. Finnegan added “We plan on a massive effort.”News of the endorsement caps a strong week for Mr. de Blasio. He reported raising the maximum amount of money allowed for the primary under the city’s voluntary public matching funds program. He also picked up the endorsements of yet another celebrity (Russell Simmons) and progressive group (New York Communities for Change).,0

Americans have righted the wrongs of our society – slavery child labor suffrage segregation and inequality for gays and immigrant workers – with creative nonviolent resistance. Climate change threatens the health and security of all Americans and action proportional to the problem is required–now.But for the sake of our children and our future we must do more to combat climate change.As for the last the Sierra Club has never authorized civil disobedience in its 120 year history ... until now.Very simply the Keystone XL pipeline is not in America's national interest . Enabling expanded tar sands exploitation is not in humanity's interest. Last night President Obama said:Mr. President with a swipe of a pen here is a chance for you to ""do more to combate climate change.""You ""must do more"".",0

83,"8 years agoWashington (CNN) - Saying ""we will respond to the threat of climate change"" President Barack Obama used his second inaugural address to put the divisive issue back on the front burner. But according to a new national survey Americans are divided over whether global warming is a man made phenomenon.The president also used his speech to highlight the controversial issue of illegal immigration and a CNN/ORC International survey released Tuesday also indicates that a bare majority of the public says the main focus of the federal government should be on developing a plan that would allow undocumented immigrants to become legal residents rather than deporting them.[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']The president warned in his Monday address that failure to respond to climate change ""would betray our children and future generations. Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires and crippling drought and more powerful storms.""According to the poll which was conducted last week 49% agree with the White House that global warming is a proven fact and is due to emissions from cars power plants and factories. That's twice as high as the number who say that global warming has not been proven as well as the 24% who say that it is a proven fact but is not due to manmade sources. But the 49% figure is down seven points from 2007.There's an expected partisan divide on the question with two-thirds of Democrats saying global warming is man made. That number drops to 48% among independent voters and is at 28% among Republicans.The president tried and failed in his first term to get a climate change bill through Congress. The president also came up empty during his first four years in the White House in trying to pass comprehensive illegal immigration reform though Congress.But Obama has put the issue on his to-do list this year and in his inaugural address he said ""our journey is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving hopeful immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunity; until bright young students and engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather than expelled from our country.""By a 53%-43% margin people questioned in the poll say that main focus of the federal government should be on developing a plan that would allow undocumented immigrants to become legal residents rather than deporting them.That's a switch from 2011 when by a 55%-42% margin Americans said that deporting undocumented residents and stopping more of them from coming into the country should be the main focus of U.S policy on illegal immigration.As expected the poll indicates a partisan divide on the issue as well as a generational divide with younger people saying allowing undocumented immigrants to become legal should be the top priority and a slight plurality of those 50 and older saying the emphasis should be on deportation and border security.One of the president's biggest domestic accomplishments in his first term was passing a sweeping health care bill through Congress in 2010. In his inauguration address Obama acknowledged that there is still much work ahead on this issue saying ""we must make the hard choices to reduce the cost of health care.""According to the poll 51% favor all or most of the provisions in the Affordable Care Act the official name of what many people refer to as ""Obamacare"" with 44% opposed to all or most of the provisions in the law.""That's a switch from 2011 when a CNN poll indicated that a majority opposed all or most of the provisions in the health care bill"" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.Minutes after his inauguration speech the president signed documents making official his nominations for some top Cabinet posts including former Sen. Chuck Hagel as defense secretary. The Nebraska Republican's nomination has been met with reservations and even outright opposition by some senators of both parties who point to past positions he has taken on Israel Iran and the war in Iraq.According to the poll 48% think the Senate should confirm Hagel.""That's twice as high as the number who oppose his confirmation but with three in ten uncertain of how they feel about the issue the White House might breathe a little easier if support for Hagel were just over 50% rather than just under that mark"" adds Holland.The poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International on Jan. 14-15 with 814 adults nationwide questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.",0
84,"Did someone say creepy and depressing?Did someone say creepy and depressing?In the months before the 2012 election a group of high-powered consultants and political operatives prepared a secret report for candidate Mitt Romney explaining how he should take over and restructure the federal government should he win the presidency. […] But now the secret is out. On May 29 the Romney Readiness Project the Republican candidate’s transition organization known as R2P published a 138-page report detailing how it prepared for a potential Romney victory.“The White House staff is similar to a holding company” read one PowerPoint slide which would have been presented to President-elect Romney as part of an expansive briefing on the morning after Election Day. It went on to list three main divisions of the metaphorical firm: “Care & Feeding Offices” like speechwriting “Policy Offices” like the National Security Council and “Packaging & Selling Offices” like the office of the press secretary.Among the recommendations for the Romney administration: • Corporate-style training seminars were planned for appointees and nominees before the inauguration to teach management skills.• A plan to restructure White House operations to suit Romney’s corporate management style with clear deliverables.• Detailed flow charts delineating how information and decisions were disseminated through the administration to achieve “unity.”Oh God no. No no no. The actual document is horrifying. It's horrifying in exactly the way you'd expect it to be horrifying coming from Mitt Freaking Romney's camp. It proposes treating the entire executive branch like a big financial firm because THAT IS WHAT MITT ROMNEY KNOWS AND LOVES PUNY FLESH-HUMANS.I see now how narrowly the satirists comedians and other snarkish wags of America averted catastrophe last November. There is no way anyone with any sense of humor could have survived the first hundred days of a Mitt Romney ""let's treat the Oval Office like a big Wall Street firm"" presidency without dying outright. The true cynics would have been killed off within a week; the optimists within a month. It was a cunning plan to murder comedy outright.Once you get past the inherent terror of someone trying to think of the White House as a ""holding company"" and whatnot most of the supposed details of the plan seem simplistic at best for something allegedly the product of a 500 person team—for example a long series of slides explaining how the White House is organized written with words like ""COO"" and ""Selling"" in an apparent attempt to explain these things to whatever executive business critters were going to be brought on board to run those things. The policy prescriptions are broad and consist almost entirely of the same one-sentence vows Romney was making in various campaign forums. (Given that more than a few tax dollars helped pay for them to come up with this stuff charging the general public $24.95 to see the depressing end results seems a bit insulting.)The White House as holding company though–gonna be seeing that one in my nightmares. Now I know how the people in Russia felt when that meteor whizzed over their heads.",0
85,"I'm going to embed the 15-minute recording below which you should listen to if you have the stomach. But here are some of Chan's ""gems"" extracted by the San Antonio Express-News:By the way this is politically incorrect. I don’t think homosexual people should do adoption. They should be banned by adoption. You’re going to confuse those kids. They should be banned.If you wanted to choose that lifestyle we don’t want to discriminate you but you shouldn’t affect the young people. How terrible. … They’re going to be confused. You see two men go into a bedroom. You see two women kissing. Is that not confusing? It’s confusing.It is actually what you call suggestive for the kids to be corrupt which is against nature. I’m telling you anything that is against nature is not right.You know to be quite honest I know this is not politically correct. I never bought in that you are born that you are born gay. I can’t imagine it.When I say that it’s … behavioral preference they say that ""No you’re born with it."" But I never bought into that.I think it’s just disgusting just to even think about.In strategizing on how to oppose the anti-discrimination ordinance Chan decided to have her staff draft an op-ed to appear in a local paper. “Can you guys come up with a draft?” she asks her aides. “Come up with draft with all the good those arguments we talk as a speaking point in terms of we’re addressing an issue that is not an issue. This is national politics again at the council level. “This is another layer of bureaucracy that we have not heard any discrimination” she continues. “And then add in the family value in there. … Maybe I’ll use the industries that we have a trend that is maybe I’ll use we have water rates and CPS rates to worry about.” “Maybe what we can do can we maybe throw some questionable confusions like OK this ‘transgender’ because the definition is so broad…”Perhaps even more interesting is how far she's willing to go to cover up her obviously antiquated views from the public.Listen to the horrifying recording yourself:Chan's then-chief of policy Jeff Bazan is the one on the recording who warns that we're on a slippery slope toward incest and bestiality (how original right?) and tells Chan to be a ""culture warrior"" on the issue. Well he's now working for pro-gay Democrat Ron Nirenberg who was just elected to the City Council as his chief of staff. Can somebody say awkward? Bazan released the following statement yesterday:I was basically explaining the viewpoint that some people have on the gay marriage issue. What I said was wrong and I deeply regret it. I can say that those comments which were intended to be purely political do not reflect my heart. Councilman Nirenberg whom I currently serve and support has made it clear that discrimination is not negotiable and I am proud to work for him.Right.As for Chan she acted as if she didn't know Stevens at first when confronted about the recording. Then she had this to say:I think that's in a private setting and I don't know if that's — I need to hear that recording to know. I'm not quite sure what you're talking about so maybe you can play that back to me. We talk a lot of things in the staff meetings so I wanted to know also under what context.There is apparently a rumor that Chan is planning a run for Mayor in 2015 which she wouldn't confirm or deny. Right. We'll see how that goes for her.",0
86,Accomplishment: When your father Dick Cheney has to go on record saying you're a bigger jerk than he is.Accomplishment: When your father Dick Cheney has to go on record saying you're a bigger jerk than he is.This is an issue we have dealt with privately for many years and we are pained to see it become public. Since it has one thing should be clear. Liz has always believed in the traditional definition of marriage. She has also treated her sister and her sister's family with love and respect exactly as she should have done. Compassion is called for even when there is disagreement about such a fundamental matter and Liz's many kindnesses shouldn't be used to distort her position.Looks like there's trouble in the Cheney clan. Liz Cheney is running for something and in the Republican party running for something means you're against gay marriage even though her own sister is gay. Her father Dick is not running for anything anymore which means he has been freed to have a non-scummy opinion on the subject—and really when noted torture-of-prisoners advocate Dick Cheney is not a gigantic asshole about something it stands out. So now we get to watch the spectacle of Dick and Lynne Cheney releasing a public statement distancing themselves from their campaigning daughter. I like how they preemptively defend Liz from the notion that she's just pretending to be an intolerant ass on the subject. Oh no dear Republicans we assure you Liz has always been an intolerant ass about this. For years! She just swallows her bile in front of her sister most of the time because family and whatnot.Put this up as another reason you probably never want to eat dinner with the Cheney family on Thanksgiving. That is probably going to be one er interesting evening. (And I hope they're not going to be cooking anyone we know.),0

88,In my Sunday column I explored the possible consequence of the Supreme Court’s impending rulings on gay marriage: a patchwork of different laws in different states making life very complicated for gay couples who want to move from one part of the country to another.But the general trend of public opinion toward greater acceptance of same-sex couples is clear. And there’s one subset of the population that’s especially intriguing: people who say homosexuality violates their religious beliefs yet are nevertheless inclined to allow gay unions as a matter of civil law. Call them “libertarian traditionalists”: culturally conservative in their own lives but upholding equal rights for those who don’t share their values.How big is this group? Perhaps surprisingly more than 1 in 4 Americans hold those seemingly conflicted opinions – at least when it comes to the general principle of equal rights for gay couples.AdvertisementTIMELINE: Gay marriage chronologyIn an invaluable series of recent polls the Pew Research Center has not only tracked the sea change in public opinion on homosexuality but has broken it down into constituent parts.AdvertisementPew polls in 2012 and 2013 found that 48% of Americans now favor allowing allowing gays and Lesbians to marry legally compared to 43% who are opposed. (Surveys performed more recently find even higher numbers in favor. An ABC News-Washington Post poll last month for example found 58% supporting gay marriage.)The value in the large-sample Pew surveys is the level of detail they offer. Pew found that majorities of both Democrats (61%) and independents (53%) favor gay marriage; self-identified Republicans (25%) are distinct outliers by comparison.AdvertisementPew found that “cross-pressured” opinion – people who oppose gay marriage in principle but support equal rights for homosexuals in practice – is more than a blip. Most respondents in the Pew polls (56%) say same-sex marriage conflicts with their religious beliefs; but half of the people in that group (28% of the public overall) also believe that same-sex couples “should have the same legal rights as heterosexual couples.”That means more than 1 in 4 Americans are holding two seemingly contradictory ideas: that gay marriage conflicts with their religious beliefs but same-sex couples should have the same rights as others. That pattern holds true for 29% of Republicans and 29% of evangelical Christians too.AdvertisementBut maybe that view isn’t as contradictory as it seems. In my column I quoted Timothy Keller pastor of an evangelical church in Manhattan saying “You can believe that homosexuality is a sin and still believe that same-sex marriage can be legal.” Keller doesn’t favor gay marriage; he was merely describing what he called an increasingly common view among young Protestant conservatives.Richard Land president of the Southern Baptist Convention’s commission on ethics and religious liberty outlined the same phenomenon in a recent interview with Politico. “Basically they just don’t think it’s something we want to talk about” he said of younger evangelicals. “[They say] ‘It feels intolerant. We believe what we believe; they have a right to what they want to believe. Marriage should be a church thing not a legal thing.’”AdvertisementALSO:McManus: SCOTUS-induced chaos on gay marriage?AdvertisementPhoto gallery: Battle of the signs at the Supreme CourtGay Marriage: What’s most offensive about the Defense of Marriage Act,0
89,Now that the U.S. Supreme Court has heard the arguments on both sides of California’s Proposition 8 and the federal Defense of Marriage Act the smart bet seems to be that though both restrictions on same-sex marriage are very likely to be struck down the court is not going to make a sweeping ruling that will allow homosexuals to marry in all 50 states.That means the political fight will go on and on. Yes the new conventional wisdom is that gay-rights advocates are certain to win the war but without a clear declaration from the high court that marriage equality is a constitutional right there are many battles yet to be fought. And the easy ones are largely over. Getting approval of same-sex marriage in places such as Washington or California or the liberal Northeast is a cinch compared to what it will take to change hearts and minds and laws in states such as Alabama and Oklahoma and Utah.A very hard task remains and the irony is that for heterosexuals getting married is ridiculously easy. Any pair of drunk heterosexual fools in Las Vegas can fall in love over the craps table run off to find an all-night chapel and wake to find themselves with hangovers cheap wedding rings and membership in the sacred club of husbands and wives.In 2004 Britney Spears showed up at the Little White Wedding Chapel in Vegas and married her childhood friend Jason Allen Alexander only to have their union annulled 55 hours later. Britney is hardly the only celebrity to have perfected the art of marriage as a short-lived publicity stunt (take a bow Kim Kardashian!). Then there was blond bimbo Anna Nicole Smith who married an 89-year-old billionaire without having to prove it was for love not for the inheritance.AdvertisementMany fabled movie stars – Elizabeth Taylor and Zsa Zsa Gabor come immediately to mind – adored being married and had the multiple spouses to prove it. Marital antics are not just a Hollywood thing though. No matter who they are or where they live or how many times they may have proved inept at matrimony or just plain unwise in the choice of a mate anybody can get married and divorced and married over and over again – as long as he or she is not gay.Meth addicts and gang-bangers can legally tie the knot and often do – sometime after the births of their children and before their own premature death. Even inmates in prison are sometimes allowed to marry. But two men who have built a home and spent devoted monogamous decades together still cannot get married in most states.That is not to say that gay people will prove to be any more successful and smart at marriage than straight Americans. I already am acquainted with two lesbian couples who married as soon as they could do it legally and divorced within a couple of years. Homosexuals are human. They will be just as foolish and unskilled at creating wedded bliss as the rest of us. But if a couple of gay guys or lesbian gals want to swill Gimlets and Cosmopolitans and then stagger to the altar at some neon-lit Las Vegas wedding chapel they should have as much right to their folly as any other Americans.,0
90,WASHINGTON — The Obama administration has urged the Supreme Court to strike down California’s voter-passed law barring same-sex marriage arguing for the first time that the Constitution protects an equal right to marry for gays and lesbians.“Tradition no matter how long established cannot by itself justify a discriminatory law” the administration said in a brief filed with the high court late Thursday. “Prejudice may not be the basis for differential treatment under the law.”The administration’s legal argument also would apply in at least seven other states that already have granted same-sex couples nearly all the rights of marriage through civil unions. To give those rights while withholding the status of marriage would amount to discrimination based on a person’s sexual orientation and that cannot be justified under the Constitution the brief says.“The designation of marriage” the brief notes “conveys a message to society that domestic partnerships or civil unions cannot match.”Presenting the argument in that manner struck a legal middle ground — giving the justices a way to overturn California’s Proposition 8 without upsetting the laws in all states that ban same-sex marriage. Gay rights advocates have asked the court to strike down all laws nationwide that bar same-sex couples from marrying but many legal analysts have doubted that a majority of the justices would go that far.The seven other states directly affected would be Delaware Hawaii Illinois Nevada New Jersey Oregon and Rhode Island the brief says.In addition the government argued laws that discriminate based on sexual orientation should be treated skeptically by the courts much as laws that discriminate by gender. That standard if adopted ultimately could invalidate other states’ laws against same-sex marriage.The administration was not required to get involved in the California case but the White House was heavily lobbied by gay rights groups that have orchestrated a series of briefs on their side by business leaders prominent Republicans and other groups. Although the government’s brief did not go as far as gay rights advocates would have liked it won immediate praise from those organizations.Unlike most other outside groups the views of the solicitor general’s office often have particular weight with the justices although the court could decide the case on several other grounds.The decision to file a brief which came after several weeks of hesitation and internal debate marks the latest step in President Obama’s self-described evolution on the issue of same-sex marriage. When he ran for president in 2008 he did not support marriage rights for gays and lesbians although he also opposed Proposition 8 which California voters approved that year.Last spring as he was running for reelection Obama said he supported gay marriage but believed the issue was a matter for the states to decide. At the time some close to him suggested he would not weigh in officially on a constitutional right to marry.But in January gay rights activists took heart when in his inaugural address Obama compared their struggle to the civil rights and women’s movements.“We the people declare today that the most evident of truths — that all of us are created equal — is the star that guides us still; just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall” Obama said in that address putting on the same plane key moments in fighting discrimination based on gender race and sexual orientation.Since then Obama had appeared at times to be debating with himself. He referred to same-sex marriage as an issue of civil rights but also told people in his inner circle that he thought social change was better when it took place through elections not by court decree.In conversations he talked about the writings of civil rights leaders who had struggled with how and when to let courts drive societal change. On Wednesday Obama seemed to be resolving that inner battle as he paid tribute to civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks at a ceremony in her honor.“Whether out of inertia or selfishness whether out of fear or a simple lack of moral imagination we so often spend our lives as if in a fog accepting injustice rationalizing inequity tolerating the intolerable” he said.“Rosa Parks tell us there’s always something we can do” he went on. “She tells us that we all have responsibilities to ourselves and to one another.”In a statement Thursday Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. also put the marriage case in the context of the country’s civil rights tradition. “Throughout history we have seen the unjust consequences of decisions and policies rooted in discrimination” he said. “The issues before the Supreme Court are not just important to the tens of thousands of Americans who are being denied equal benefits and rights under our laws but to our nation as a whole.”Publicly White House officials took pains to present the decision of whether to weigh in on the marriage case as one made at the Justice Department.“The president obviously has expressed an opinion in the past on this issue as a matter of policy but when it comes to legal and constitutional issues around it that’s a jurisdiction that resides at the Department of Justice” White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said.Privately however senior administration officials made clear that on such a weighty policy issue the government’s lawyers would wait for the president’s decision.The case before the court will be the first to directly confront the justices with the question of whether the U.S. Constitution gives gays and lesbians a right to marry.Judges in several states have upheld gay marriage under their state constitutions and the California Supreme Court did the same in 2008. Proposition 8 overturned that ruling by changing the state constitution.The case before the high court began shortly afterward when two same-sex couples sued in federal court in San Francisco arguing that excluding them from marrying violated their rights to liberty and equal treatment.A federal judge agreed and struck down Proposition 8. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision but did so on the narrower basis that the voters could not take marriage rights from gays and lesbians once those rights had been granted.In December the Supreme Court voted to hear an appeal from defenders of Proposition 8 who say the courts should defer to the wishes of the state’s voters.California’s top officials including Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris have joined the case on the side of the gay plaintiffs. In a brief filed this week Harris noted that more than 50000 children in California are being raised by same-sex couples.“California’s interests in protecting all of its children are best served by allowing these same-sex couples to enjoy the same benefits of marriage as opposite-sex couples” Harris said.The case will be argued before the court on March 26.david.savage@latimes.comchristi.parsons@latimes.com,0
91,Bigots.Bigots.Scanning national media over the last several days one sees words such as homophobia bigotry and xenophobia thrown like confetti by liberals at anyone who dare say that under the federal constitution states have the right to define marriage. These scare tactics are actually working—Cardinal Timothy Dolan the archbishop of New York felt compelled to appear on national TV and explain that Catholic religious belief that marriage is between a man and a woman forever to create life is not bigotry but a religious teaching. The left's response—not enough. Nothing is enough short of changing religious doctrine to fit the beliefs of the liberal masses.This is a common refrain in right-wing circles these days:This is driving the wingers to distraction. Theirs is an entire movement built on the politics of resentment from the racist Southern Strategy to anti-gay ballot initiatives. Now those roosters are coming home to roost and the damage inflicted is incalculable.We liberals always knew modern conservatism was (literally) built on racial resentment from the day the Republican Party accepted the Dixiecrats with open arms. But that brand is seeping into the broader mainstream. I keep going back to this GOP focus group in Ohio after the 2012 election where young working-class white voters expressed dissatisfaction with President Barack Obama and the Democrats but were just vicious in their assessment of the GOP:None of them expressed great enthusiasm for Obama. But their depiction of Republicans was even more lacerating than the women’s had been. “Racist” “out of touch” and “hateful” made the list — “and put ‘1950s’ on there too!” one called out.Remember those aren't liberals but the kind of white working-class swing-state voters Republicans need to attract to offset their growing disadvantages with non-Anglo voters. But few want to vote for a racist hateful out-of-touch party straight out of the 1950s.That's why you'll now see the bigots spend half their time arguing that they're not bigots and don't really hate gay people it's just that they can't tolerate something consenting adults are doing so fuck them and their rights. See? It's not bigotry. It's just intolerance which is totally different than bigotry!The mask is off the modern GOP and all the whining and revisionism can't change the fact that America sees them for the hateful paranoid bigoted xenophobes that they are. And if that hurts their chances at winning elections? It just means that sometimes there really is justice in this world.,0

94,Saying that “gay rights are human rights’’ Hillary Rodham Clinton the former secretary of state and potential 2016 presidential candidate has endorsed same-sex marriage.“I believe America is at its best when we champion the freedom and dignity of every human being’’ Mrs. Clinton said in a video posted Monday on the Internet by the Human Rights Campaign a gay rights advocacy group. Her announcement comes as the Supreme Court is about to hear two landmark gay rights cases that advocates hope will make same-sex marriage legal in all 50 states.Mrs. Clinton’s announcement represents a switch in position; as a presidential candidate in 2008 she explicitly opposed same-sex marriage saying that she favored civil unions but that decisions about the legality of marriage should be left to the states. (Until last year President Obama took that position as well; the president now favors a right to marriage for gay couples.) But Mrs. Clinton did take steps to protect gay couples when she was secretary of state work that she said “inspired me to think anew” about the values she holds.“L.G.B.T. Americans are our colleagues our teachers our soldiers our friends our loved ones and they are full and equal citizens and deserve the rights of citizenship’’ she said in the six-minute video using the abbreviation for lesbian gay bisexual and transgender. “That includes marriage.’’Mrs. Clinton spoke in the video of the recent wedding of her own daughter Chelsea saying “I wish every parent that same joy.’’Mrs. Clinton and her family have longstanding ties to the Human Rights Campaign. The group’s president Chad Griffin was born in Hope Ark. – Bill Clinton’s hometown – and got his start in politics volunteering for Mr. Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign. The former president and Chelsea Clinton expressed their support for same-sex marriage when it was under consideration in the New York State legislature.And just last week Mr. Clinton expressed his explicit support for overturning the federal Defense of Marriage Act the 1996 law — which he signed — that requires the federal government to view marriage as between a man and a woman for legal purposes.,0

I now have an absolute hatred for the sack that is Tim Huelskamp because he managed to hork up nearly every self-centered pompous-assed non-argument used by outright morons in the span of one quick paragraph and there really ought to be a rule saying if you do that the general citizenrygets to put you in the official congressional Dunk Tank and start flinging balls until somebody gets lucky.God damn it here we have a person honestly using ""God the flag mom and apple pie"" as the pillars of ""the American paradigm"" and they're not doing it ironically neither the ""apple pie"" or the ""paradigm"" part. No Tim here means it literally and goes on to say that Bloomberg's soda ban and Michelle Obama's gentle-but-possibly-Hitlerish suggestions that our nation's kids get up off their fat asses every once in a while means that apple pie is under attack. This screed isn't an April Fool's prank this is a April Fool's way of life preached about by an April Fool's mind taken as a holy god damn April Fool's sacrament.You are an idiot and nobody's arguing anything about that and by the way you are an idiot. Do you think—and we're just going to explore this for one second before my migraine ends this entire path of debate—that if we do not allow same-sex marriage those children are suddenly going to get a mom and a dad? That there are gay couples out there who if we deny same-sex marriage will say ""Oh rats well I guess I am now going to form a lifelong partnership with the opposite gender which will suck for me but now my hypothetical future child will at least have appropriate biological nurturing."" No. This does not happen. I hate you for thinking that this will somehow happen—that the only thing standing between every child and the one-man one-woman parenting that a great many of them do not currently have is to deny gay Americans certain legal and tax structurings.You Tim Huelskamp are a monster. Here you say that children should be raised by their biological mothers and fathers and yet you say yourself that you've adopted four of them. You are a terrible person. Those children will never know the love of a genetically related male/female pairing placed in that prime nurturing role and I can only assume it's because you you bastard adopted them rather than letting them rot in an orphanage or on the streets where they could get a better appreciation of why it is they would want that thing.I don't even want to go through all of Huelskamp's drivel; it's all just a collection of other people's most vapid thoughts dumbed down beaten up then put in The Sack and tossed into op-ed form. It hurts. But the main argument such as it is is that if we let gay marriage take place then gay people are going to somehow god damn take our god damn children and raise them in god damn non-preferentially-biological households because god damn magic and it would be better to not allow marriage equality at all than allow that. He's not even talking about ""gay Americans should not adopt children"" which would be at least something vaguely approaching the point he roughly purports to be orbiting around he's saying that the Supreme Court recognizing same-sex relationships as existing things at all is an affront to ""motherhood"" and ""God"" and sweet Jeebus ""apple pie.""This. This is why I have come to thoroughly despise this entire debate. Because it is not earnest it is not thoughtful it is not anything but the tin-eared rantings of bigoted dull-minded twerps who know they don't like same sex marriages being recognized but can't rustle up so much as even the slightest actual substantive non-God-says-so argument against the thing. God does not care what the tax status of same-sex couples is nor do I expect the big guy on the cloud has a pressing interest in making sure a pair of people can't get hospital visitation or other legal rights if they don't have the proper combination of non-matching genitalia. Even if we were to all stipulate that a one-mom-one-dad family is better for the children than a one-mom or one-dad single-parent version in all cases full stop which itself is an implausible argument you had at least better occupy yourself with explaining why you think a two-dad version has to be inferior to a single father or a two-mom version worse than the single mom version and not this damn generic high fructose corn syrup of arguments this blanket assertion that if we somehow discriminate more it will result in unspecified magic in which we don't have single parents or foster homes or divorce or cheating spouses or broken homes or abusive parents or one bad traffic accident or teenage moms or Those Damn People Who Think Different From Me anymore.This is what happens when the last blowhards in an argument know they have lost. This is what happens when all sensible people have at long last moved on leaving only the dim bulbs and the lard-for-brains and the burlap sacks of discount-grade asbestos to prop up the dying cause. You get people like this guy droning on with mealy-mouthed phrases that mean nothing mustered for an argument that doesn't even make any internal sense mustered because the only people left on the loser's side of the debate are people who do not give a damn whether their arguments make any sense and all regurgitated up by whatever die-hard friendly rag has not yet evolved sufficient shame to know how silly it all looks. I will be very very glad when these people evolve that sense of shame. Anytime now please.",0
98,"8 years ago(CNN) - Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri announced her support for same-sex marriage on Monday joining high-profile names on both sides of the aisle who have endorsed the right for gay couples to legally wed.""I have come to the conclusion that our government should not limit the right to marry based on who you love"" she wrote on her Tumblr page. ""While churches should never be required to conduct marriages outside of their religious beliefs neither should the government tell people who they have a right to marry.""[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']Her public endorsement comes as the Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments this week on challenges to Proposition 8 the voter-approved same-sex marriage ban in California as well as the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) a 1996 congressional law that says for federal purposes marriage is defined as only between one man and one woman.Republican Sen. Rob Portman also reversed his stance on the issue and announced his support earlier this month citing his gay son as a big reason for his change of heart. Last week former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also publicly backed the issue.And in February a chorus of prominent Republicans including former GOP presidential candidate Jon Huntsman signed onto an amicus brief that advocated for the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex marriage.McCaskill who was recently sworn into a second term and is not up for re-election until 2018 says her views have ""changed over time""""As many of my gay and lesbian friends colleagues and staff embrace long term committed relationships I find myself unable to look them in the eye without honestly confronting this uncomfortable inequality"" she wrote adding that her decision is ""simply the right thing to do.""McCaskill was considered one of the most vulnerable Democrats in 2012 but survived re-election after her Republican opponent Rep. Todd Akin made controversial comments about rape.The senator in posting her announcement also cited a Bible verse: I Corinthians 13 which says ""And now abide faith hope love these three; but the greatest of these is love.""""Good people disagree with me"" she wrote. ""On the other hand my children have a hard time understanding why this is even controversial. I think history will agree with my children.""- CNN's Alison Harding contributed to this report.",0
99,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate pushed toward a historic vote on legislation outlawing workplace discrimination against gay bisexual and transgender Americans demonstrating the nation's quickly evolving attitude toward gay rights nearly two decades after Congress rejected same-sex marriage.All 55 members of the Democratic majority including senators from the Deep South and several Republicans were expected to unite on Thursday in backing the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. Sen. John McCain the GOP's presidential nominee in 2008 signaled his conditional support on Wednesday.""It is time for Congress to pass a federal law that ensures all our citizens - regardless of where they live - can go to work unafraid to be who they are"" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid D-Nev. who urged House Speaker John Boehner R-Ohio to reconsider his opposition.The enthusiasm of the bill's supporters was tempered by the reality that the Republican-led House where conservatives have a firm grip on the agenda is unlikely to even vote on the legislation. Boehner maintains his longstanding opposition to the measure arguing that it is unnecessary and certain to create costly frivolous lawsuits for businesses. Outside conservative groups have cast the bill as anti-family.In the Senate opponents of the legislation remained mute through three days of debate with no lawmaker speaking out. That changed on Thursday as Republican Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana said the legislation would force employers to violate their religious beliefs a direct counter to rights embodied in the Constitution.""There's two types of discrimination here we're dealing with and one of those goes to the very fundamental right granted to every American through our Constitution a cherished value of freedom of expression and religion"" Coats said.The Senate rejected an amendment sponsored by Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania that would have expanded the number of groups that are covered under the religious exemption. Opponents argued that it would undermine the core bill.Story continuesSenate passage would be a major victory for gay rights advocates in a momentous year for the issue. The Supreme Court in June affirmed gay marriage and granted federal benefits to legally married same-sex couples. In the heartland Illinois is on the verge of becoming the 15th state to legalize gay marriage along with the District of Columbia.""I hope that we are on the verge of making history tomorrow by passing this bill with a strong vote"" Sen. Susan Collins R-Maine said Wednesday. ""I then hope that our colleagues on the House side will follow suit and that we can see this bill signed into law.""If the House fails to act on the bill gay rights advocates are likely to press President Barack Obama to act unilaterally and issue an executive order barring anti-gay workplace discrimination by federal contractors.Through three days of Senate debate backers of the bill repeatedly described it as an issue of fairness some 50 years after Congress passed and President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act.""It is well past time that we as elected representatives ensure that our laws protect against discrimination in the workplace for all individuals that we ensure ... some protections for those within the LGBT community"" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski R-Alaska who described the diversity in her state.Murkowski's support underscored the generational shift. Seventeen years ago when a bill dealing with discrimination based on sexual orientation failed by one vote in the Senate the senator's father Frank voted against it. That was the same year that Congress passed and President Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act.Current federal law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex race and national origin. But it doesn't stop an employer from firing or refusing to hire workers because they are gay lesbian bisexual or transgender.The bill would bar employers with 15 or more workers from using a person's sexual orientation or gender identity as the basis for making employment decisions including hiring firing compensation or promotion. It would exempt religious institutions and the military.By voice vote Wednesday the Senate approved an amendment from Republican Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire that would prevent federal state and local governments from retaliating against religious groups that are exempt from the law.The Senate planned to vote Thursday on an amendment by Sen. Pat Toomey R-Pa. to expand the number of groups that are covered under the religious exemption.Likely Senate approval of the overall bill reflects the nation's growing tolerance of gays and the GOP's political calculation as it looks for supporters beyond its core base of older voters. A Pew Research survey in June found that more Americans said homosexuality should be accepted rather than discouraged by society by a margin of 60 percent to 31 percent. Opinions were more evenly divided 10 years ago.Deep-pocketed Republican-leaning groups such as the American Unity Fund which counts on hedge fund billionaires and Mitt Romney donors as well as former Republican lawmakers pushed for the legislation.Twenty-two states and the District of Columbia have approved laws banning workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and 17 of those also prohibit employers from discriminating based on gender identity.About 88 percent of Fortune 500 companies have adopted nondiscrimination policies that include sexual orientation according to the Human Rights Campaign. About 57 percent of those companies include gender identity.",0
100,"One of the original stories is at here AlternetThe Presidential Inauguration Committee announced Tuesday that the President Obama has selected Pastor Louie Giglio of the Georgia-based Passion City Church to deliver the benediction for his second inauguration. In a mid-1990s sermon identified as Giglio’s available online on a Christian training Web site he preached rabidly anti-LGBT views. The 54-minute sermon entitled “In Search of a Standard – Christian Response to Homosexuality” advocates for dangerous “ex-gay” therapy for gay and lesbian people references a biblical passage often interpreted to require gay people be executed and impels Christians to “firmly respond to the aggressive agenda” and prevent the “homosexual lifestyle”I can tell you that one of the most hurtful parts of the first Obama administration was asking to have Rick Warren speak at his inaugural. He was giving a platform to someone who spread hate when there were so many other choices there. It was greatly resented by many in the LGBT community. In fact it set off a chain of events (Rev. Robinson ""accidentally"" not being shown on live TV etc.) which got Obama off on very bad footing with many in the LGBT community.Following McClurkin I was very angry with Obama. Then came Warren. But apparently Obama/the inaugural team haven't learned anything:From above Alternet piece:(17:37) Men women I can’t say anything other to you tonight than this that if you look at the counsel of the word of God Old Testament New Testament you come quickly to the conclusion that homosexuality is not an alternate lifestyle… homosexuality is not just a sexual preference homosexuality is not gay but homosexuality is sin. It is sin in the eyes of God and it is sin according to the word of God. You come to only one conclusion: homosexuality is less than God’s best for his creation. It is less than God’s best for us and everything in our lives that is less than God’s best for us and his plan for us and his design for us is sin. That’s God’s voice. If you want to hear God’s voice that is his voice to this issue of homosexuality. It is not ambiguous and unclear. It is very clear.There are numerous other very incendiary quotes.So let me address the naysayers now:- But Obama has done so much for LGBT rights it's just a speaker at the InaugurationUm first if you are trying to make improving LGBT rights a cornerstone of your presidency you don't have to spit in the eye of the people you are supposedly trying to help. This is a PERSONAL choice. Hagel I can somewhat justify because there are other plusses to his candidacy. This is Obama picking yet another bigot when there could be much better choices out there who were/are not so vehemently anti-gayAlso when will he get past this bullshit of making in-roads with these people? These people will always vote against him and his agenda. Why give the marquee moment to a hater- But but he said those things long agoYeah and those are the seeds of hatred which were sown in the very people today who support discrimination against LGBT people.Also if Shirley Sherrod is up for scrutiny for what she didn't even say Hagel for his homophobic remarks they why should this guy not be held accountable as would anything with a history of anti-African American anti-woman anti-Hispanic anti- remarks. Yeah the times are changing and its time for the haters and the Vichy apologists to be held accountable for hating when it was a much bigger trend.And for what it's worth I am against Hagel ALSO for this reason. As Maddow pointed out there will be many many issues involving LGBT people in the military coming up. So he should answer for his bigotry then. Yet another reason why he is a bad choice.- But but Obama has a GAY CUBAN poet speakingAnd this argument pisses me off most of all. In Obama and Co's mind if you put up a minority group that cancels out makes ok having the hater up there. No it doesn't. You don't have a ""mixed program"" by putting up people who have advanced society like Ms. Evers and those who have held it back. Once again we'll likely have an inauguration with the usual symbolic winks and nods to the LGBT community while the hater gets a front row seat.Starting off Obama II in a sucky way like he started off Obama I. Except he can't blame Boehner for this one. A fucking huge disappointment.",0
101,House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi suddenly an expert on the Constitution said on Wednesday that she and Barack Obama are “honoring the Constitution” in their attacks on the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). Pelosi pontificated:And given a choice I think we would all say we’re honoring as the president does the Constitution. When you pass a bill in the House as we did with the health care bill we made it iron clad constitutionally. You have a responsibility to honor the Constitution. In fact we take an oath to do just that and that is the oath that President Obama is upholding.Attacking the GOP’s support for the Defense of Marriage Act Pelosi whined:We weigh equities. Congress passes a bill. It’s questionable in terms of constitutionality. There’s no question about your oath to the Constitution of the United States and the behavior of the Republicans in the House of Representatives on this subject has been so irresponsible. First of all why in this time would you pass a bill that increases discrimination? We’re going in the direction of the arc of Justice [Henry L.] Benning in favor of more justice not more discrimination. Why would you do such a thing in the first place? And then when it is questioned in terms of its constitutionality to spend money in the tune of millions outside the regular order of how that money should be spent to defend increasing discrimination in our society it’s just plain wrong. And given a choice I think we would all say we’re honoring as the president does the Constitution.Pelosi boasted of her home city’s influence in the assault on traditional values claiming that same-sex marriage is “inevitable.” She continued:From our beautiful place in San Francisco the city of St. Francis we knew that it was inevitable that all of this would happen. It was inconceivable to others that it would and it was our job to use whatever influence we could have to shorten the distance between the inevitable and the inconceivable. And I think that’s what’s happening at the court because of many people’s courage especially those directly personally affected.,1

106,“We are the ones we’ve been waiting for. We are the change we seek” candidate Barack Obama said in 2008. At the time his comments came in for criticism: They were narcissistic; they were tautological; they didn’t make a whole lot of sense.But in the aftermath of Obama’s 2012 reelection and his second inaugural address his 2008 remarks seem less a statement of self-absorption than one of prophecy. There is an Obama majority in American politics symbolized by Monday’s throng on the Mall whose existence is both the consequence of profound changes to our nation’s composition and values and the cause of changes yet to come.That majority as the president made clear in his remarks would not exist but for Americans’ struggles to expand our foundational belief in the equality of all men. The drive to expand equality he said in his speech’s most historically resonant line “is the star that guides us still just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall.”Our history Obama argued is one of adapting our ideals to a changing world. His speech (like recent books by Michael Lind and my Post colleague E.J. Dionne Jr.) reclaimed U.S. history from the misrepresentations of both constitutional originalists and libertarian fantasists. “Fidelity to our founding principles requires new responses to new challenges” the president said. “Preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action. For the American people can no more meet the demands of today’s world by acting alone than American soldiers could have met the forces of fascism or communism with muskets and militias.”Having established that the moral and practical arc of U.S. history bends toward equality Obama vowed to push his demands for equality still further — to ending the systemic underpayment of female workers; the voter suppression that compels some Americans usually minorities to wait hours to cast their votes; the deportations of immigrants who would otherwise help build the economy; and the laws that forbid gay Americans to marry.1 of 68 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Obama View Photos A collection of cartoons of the president. Caption A collection of cartoons of the president. Wait 1 second to continue.As the president acknowledged however social equality is rising even as the relative economic equality that once defined American life has sharply and broadly receded. “Our country cannot succeed” he said “when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it.” For this Obama prescribed revamping our taxes and reforming our schools but these are by no means sufficient to transform our nation into one that as the president put it “rewards the effort and determination of every single American.” The waning of the middle class is with climate change the most vexing item on the president’s agenda and requires far-reaching solutions beyond any he laid out. U.S. workers must regain the power they once had to bargain for their wages but that only begins the list of economic reforms that are as difficult to achieve as they are necessary to re-create an financially vibrant nation.The president closed his speech by asking his supporters to join him to help “shape the debates of our time.” The biggest mistake Obama made when he took office was to effectively disband the organization of the millions of Americans who had worked for his election — for fear in part that it might upset members of Congress whose votes he would need for his policies. He wants no such unilateral political disarmament now; his operatives hope to keep his 2012 campaign’s volunteer army in the field for the legislative battles ahead. Obama’s legions have proven that they can win elections and this matters a great deal more the president has learned than whatever trace elements of goodwill he may win by deferring to Congress.The Obama Majority — its existence and mobilization — is what enabled the president to deliver so ideological an address. No such inaugural speech has been delivered since Ronald Reagan took office in 1981 demanding the curtailment of government programs and secure in the knowledge that much of the white working class had shifted its allegiance away from the Democrats and supported his attack on the public sector and minority rights. On Monday Obama secure in the knowledge that the nation’s minorities had joined with other liberal constituencies to form a new governing coalition voiced their demands to ensure equality and to preserve and expand the government’s efforts to meet the nation’s challenges. As he left the stage he stopped and turned to marvel at the crowd at the new American majority they represented. They were the ones he and we were waiting for.Read more from Harold Meyerson’s archive or follow him on Twitter.,0
107,"PROVIDENCE R.I. (AP) — Hundreds of supporters of same-sex marriage rights assembled at the Rhode Island Statehouse on Tuesday urging lawmakers to make the nation's smallest state the 10th to allow gay and lesbian couples to wed — and the last to do so in New England.House Speaker Gordon Fox who is gay has called for a vote on same-sex marriage legislation in his chamber by month's end making Rhode Island the latest state to address an issue whose supporters see things swinging their way after voters in Maine Maryland and Washington approved gay marriage last fall.About 300 supporters and opponents signed up to address the legislative committee reviewing the bill — they were limited to 2 minutes each to keep the hearing from going all night — while hundreds more gathered in the hallways outside the hearing.Downstairs a raucous rally of gay-marriage opponents beneath the Statehouse rotunda at times drowned out those testifying in the third-floor committee room.""I'd like us to get on the right side of history"" said Josephine O'Connell 71 of Providence who said it ""breaks her heart"" that her home state is the only one in New England that doesn't allow gays and lesbians like her to marry. ""I don't want to be looking back in 20 years thinking 'what were we thinking?'""Gov. Lincoln Chafee an independent and Treasurer Gina Raimondo a Democrat both spoke out in favor of gay marriage at the hearing.""I'm here as your treasurer but I'm really here as a mother and wife"" said Raimondo. ""Every Rhode Islander deserves the same rights that we have.""Hundreds of others showed up to urge lawmakers in this heavily Catholic state to drop the legislation and protect the current definition of marriage.The Roman Catholic Church opposes the legislation on religious grounds — and more practical ones. The Rev. Bernard Healey told lawmakers that the Providence Diocese is concerned Catholic schools and charitable organizations could be forced to change their employee benefit policies if compelled to recognize the same-sex spouses of employees.Story continues""We are here to defend and support the longstanding definition of marriage... as the exclusive and lasting relationship of a man and a woman"" Healey said. ""Using the law to alter or redefine marriage is an injustice to those who have embraced this way of life.""Others warned that allowing gay marriage would erode social norms.""Just because these states in New England have decided to redefine marriage doesn't mean we should follow them down this path"" said Michael Krzywonos of Pawtucket. ""The polygamists will be next in line. Then we'll begin to test the boundaries of what age is permissible. And then we will test whether love and marriage can only be between two people.""Supporters are hoping to build on national momentum following the votes in Maine Maryland and Washington. Meanwhile in Minnesota voters rejected a proposed state constitutional amendment that would have prohibited gay marriage the first time such a ballot question has failed in the United States.Lawmakers in Illinois are also expected to consider gay marriage this year.Supporters in Rhode Island expect the measure will pass the Democrat-controlled House but concede the state Senate is more challenging. Senate President Teresa Paiva Weed a Newport Democrat is a gay marriage opponent but has said she will allow a committee vote on the legislation should it pass the House. She said Tuesday that she would not vote for the legislation as it's currently written.State lawmakers have passed civil unions for gay couples and Chafee signed an executive order recognizing gay marriages performed in other states.",0
108,As anyone who’s watched even a few minutes of A&E’s reality hit “Duck Dynasty” can tell you Phil Robertson is a pretty conservative guy.But in an interview published in January’s GQ Magazine the duck call inventor and Roberston family patriarch goes on record with comments about the sinfulness of gays and black people under Jim Crow that are about as forward-thinking as his Old Testament facial hair.In the profile an unedited Robertson sounds off on what’s ailing the country during a trip through the Louisiana backwoods.PHOTOS: Rednecks translate to greenbacks on TVAdvertisement“Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there. Bestiality sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men” he tells reporter Drew Magary. “Don’t be deceived. Neither the adulterers the idolaters the male prostitutes the homosexual offenders the greedy the drunkards the slanderers the swindlers—they won’t inherit the kingdom of God. Don’t deceive yourself. It’s not right.”He also muses rather colorfully about his own sexual orientation: “It seems like to me a vagina—as a man—would be more desirable than a man’s anus. That’s just me. I’m just thinking: There’s more there! She’s got more to offer. I mean come on dudes! You know what I’m saying? But hey sin: It’s not logical my man. It’s just not logical.”In a quote that may raise even more eyebrows than his feelings about gays Robertson claims he “never” saw black people mistreated during the pre-civil rights era in his home state and strongly suggests that African Americans were more content under Jim Crow.PHOTOS: Celebrities react to Prop 8 dismissal on TwitterAdvertisement“Where we lived was all farmers. The blacks worked for the farmers. I hoed cotton with them. I’m with the blacks because we’re white trash” he said. “They’re singing and happy. I never heard one of them one black person say ‘I tell you what: These doggone white people’—not a word!... Pre-entitlement pre-welfare you say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues.”Robertson also shares an interesting rationale for voting for Mitt Romney over President Obama saying he favored the candidate because he was from Salt Lake City a safer city than Chicago. “Where would I rather be turned around at 3 o’clock in the morning?” he said. As Magary points out Romney though a Mormon hails from Boston.The Robertsons particularly Phil are outspoken about their Christian faith (each episode of “Duck Dynasty” ends with a prayer) and have also campaigned for Republicans but their show a hit in red and blue states alike is largely nonpolitical and has so far carefully avoided issues such as race and gay rights.The comments could prove to be a headache for A&E which has a ratings winner in “Duck Dynasty.” The August season premiere of the technically unscripted (if carefully edited) series garnered 11.8 million viewers setting a record for a nonfiction cable program and it regularly beats out many shows on broadcast. Season 5 is set to bow Jan. 15.AdvertisementA&E was not immediately available for comment.ALSO:‘Duck Dynasty’s’ Jase Robertson claims he was ‘facially profiled’Is Uncle Si ‘Duck Dynasty’s’ breakout star?AdvertisementCritic’s Notebook: ‘Duck Dynasty’ is a canny curation of culturesTwitter: @MeredithBlake,0
109,"First we have Professor Michael Dorf from Cornell Law School:“If the court thought it was going to get a few years I think they were naïve.”Professor Dorf said there are probably not five votes on the Supreme Court to block Judge Shelby’s ruling. “On the strictly legal argument” he said “it’s hard to justify granting a stay.” But he added that the lower courts should have done so partly because of the potential cruelty of voiding the new marriages and partly because the Supreme Court is hard to predict. “It’s pretty clear that even the five justices who are sympathetic to same-sex marriage would rather take a few years before getting there” Professor Dorf wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. “If their hand is forced as it now will be it’s impossible to say with certainty what they’ll do.”Dorf of course thinks that the lower court and the 10th Circuit should have issued a stay. Now that several hundred couples have been married in Utah that seems more moot than the several hundred couples San Francisco married in 2004.""Would rather."" What a pity they're being rushed. Liptak doesn't see this as an issue for this term but sees it for the session that begins in October 2015 (which is what I've been saying) by which time that will be several thousand couples in Utah not several hundred and several hundred no doubt in Idaho and Colorado and Wyoming because Utah is closer than say New Mexico or Iowa.And yes Liptak points out that the Utah decision was based on a sentence in Scalia's dissent on the Windsor case“The view that this court will take of state prohibition of same-sex marriage is indicated beyond mistaking by today’s opinion”did not impress Jason Mazzone a law professor at the University of Illinois. “His opinion would have appeared considerably more judicial had he resisted the urge to give Justice Scalia the finger” Professor Mazzone wrote in a blog post last Friday.as GrafZeppelin127 and Kalil pointed out here when the decision was published a gesture that as Liptak reportsWell okay!But Michael Klarman a historian at Harvard Law School now thinks two to six years even with the current composition of the court. He doesn't think it's open-ended any more.So Utah has set the wheels in motion for the endgame. Illinois Oregon and New Jersey are in the pipeline now. Historically this is a QUICK process as we remember that Prop 8 was only five years ago. Of course the Supreme Court COULD have done this sooner by accepting the Ninth Circuit's decision on Prop 8 a decision that is now lost to them but I think I can wait a couple of years.Now our task is to change the composition of the House so we can get ENDA passed and signed.",0
110,"Deirdre Shesgreen Gannett Washington BureauOhio Republican Sen. Rob Portman announces his support of legalizing gay marriageOnly current U.S. Senator and one of just a few members of Congress to support gay marriageGay son encouraged Portman to switch his positionWASHINGTON — Republican Sen. Rob Portman said Thursday that he now supports gay marriage — a surprise turnabout on a hot-button social issue sparked by a deeply personal reflection that began two years ago after Portman's son Will told him that he is gay.""It's a change of heart from the position of a father"" Portman told three Ohio reporters on Thursday during a 45-minute interview in his office. ""I think we should be allowing gay couples the joy and stability of marriage.""Portman's endorsement of gay marriage makes him the only sitting Republican senator to hold that position. But it comes at a time when public attitudes are shifting quickly on the issue and more and more states are sanctioning gay marriage.Ohio's junior senator outlined his position in the interview and in an op-ed that appears Friday in The Columbus Dispatch.""I have come to believe that if two people are prepared to make a lifetime commitment to love and care for each other in good times and bad the government shouldn't deny them the opportunity to get married"" Portman writes in the op-ed. ""This isn't how I've always felt.""Portman said his own evolution on the issue began in 2011 when Will then a freshman at Yale University made a stunning revelation.""Will … came to Jane and me and announced that he was gay that it was not a choice. It was who he is and he had been that way since he could remember"" Portman recalled of the conversation. ""Jane and I were both surprised very surprised but also very supportive of him. Our reaction was not about policy or positions. It was about him as a son and letting him know we were 110% supportive of him.""His son's homosexuality ""allowed me to think about this issue from a new perspective and that's as a dad who loves his son a lot"" Portman said. He said he wants Will to have the same chance at an enduring relationship ""like Jane and I have had for over 26 years.""Portman — who until now said marriage should only be between a man and a woman — said it took him ""a while"" to make the political shift and ""get comfortable"" supporting gay marriage.Portman was among those who as a member of the House in 1996 voted in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) which defines marriage as between a man and a woman and bars federal recognition of same-sex marriage. It also says states can't be forced to recognize a same-sex marriage performed in another state. Portman also voted in favor of a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage when he was in the House.""Rob believes marriage is a sacred bond between one man and one woman"" Portman's spokesman told The Cincinnati Enquirer in 2011. At the time Portman was the target of a protest by University of Michigan Law School students. He had been invited to deliver the school's commencement address but nearly 300 students angry about Portman's opposition to gay rights asked the school to revoke the invitation.On Thursday Portman said he would like to see Congress repeal the provision of DOMA that bans federal recognition of same-sex marriage although he still supports the part of the law that says states should not be forced to recognize same-sex marriages.""I'm of the view that the states ought to be deciding this issue and frankly that's happening increasingly"" Portman said.Portman who is Methodist said he did not come to this new position easily or quickly. He talked to his pastor and other religious leaders. He talked to his family friends and political allies. He talked to those who support gay marriage including former vice president Dick Cheney — as well as those who do not including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell R-Ky.""I have had a process and a journey"" he said. ""I've done a lot of reading. I've done a lot of talking to folks.""Asked whether he would support overturning Ohio's state ban on same-sex marriage if it comes up in a voter referendum Portman said yes.""I'm going to be supportive of Ohioans having the opportunity to marry"" he said. ""I would not plan to take a leadership role in this but people will know my position.""Other Republicans have similarly embraced same-sex marriage. For example more than 80 prominent Republicans — including ex-governors former members of Congress and veterans of the George W. Bush administration — are planning to file a ""friend of the court"" brief asking the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down California's Proposition 8 which banned same-sex marriage.The signers include former governors Jon Huntsman of Utah Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey and William Weld of Massachusetts.But many Republicans in Congress including House Speaker John Boehner remain fiercely opposed to same-sex marriage. And the issue ignites strong passions among social conservatives a key base for Portman in Ohio.Portman said Will who is now 21 nudged him to change his views and wanted him to publicly declare his support for gay marriage. ""He hasn't pushed me but he's been encouraging and he's been very much involved"" he said.Portman said his previous views on marriage were rooted in his faith. But ""the overriding message of love and compassion that I take from the Bible . . . and the fact that I believe we are all created by our maker . . . that has all influenced me in terms of my change on this issue"" he said.Portman said he concluded that marriage as an institution would be strengthened by allowing gay couples to wed.""When two people make a commitment to one another it can actually enhance the institution of marriage"" he said.Even as he endorsed same-sex marriage Portman said this would not suddenly become a top legislative priority for him. He has no plans for example to introduce legislation to repeal elements of DOMA or take on any other gay rights issues.""I'm kind of an economic policy wonk"" he said. ""That's how I got into this business. That's been my priority and my focus and it will continue to be.""Portman said he wanted to announce his position now in part because the Supreme Court will hear arguments on DOMA later this month.""I felt it was important to let my constituents know where I stand because these court cases are going to encourage members of the media to ask senators and House members what their position is"" Portman said adding that he wanted ""to do this before the politics of these court decisions . . . makes it more difficult maybe to have an honest discussion.""Portman said he's told some of his Republican colleagues about his shift and all of them have been very ""respectful"" of his decision even if they don't agree.He consulted Cheney whose daughter is gay about the issue last weekend when they were both attending a conference. ""His advice was 'Do the right thing. Follow your heart' "" Portman said.Asked how this might affect his political career Portman who has been touted as a possible 2016 presidential candidate said he had no idea.""That has nothing to do with my decision"" he said. ""This was personally and family initiated and then it was a process of carefully thinking through the issue.""",1
111,"Story highlights Two Jewish sprinters from U.S. kept from running in Nazi Germany in 1936 OlympicsLZ Granderson: The 2014 Olympics taking place in Russia with its extreme anti-gay lawsIn Russia LGBT teens reportedly being kidnapped bullied even killed he saysAll of Congress should sign letter for Russia to ensure LGBT Americans' safety he saysUsually when we talk about the 1936 Olympics in Berlin we focus on two men -- Adolf Hitler and Jesse Owens -- and rightfully so. They are the two with an undeniable impact on history albeit in vastly different ways.But in light of President Barack Obama's recent remarks on ""The Tonight Show"" denouncing Russia's new anti-gay laws laws that have led to bloodshed in the streets it is important that we remember Marty Glickman and Sam Stoller.They too were at those games. They too left a mark.You see the day before they were scheduled to run in the 400-meter relay their coach Dean Cromwell replaced them.They were not injured.LZ GrandersonThey did not break any team rules nor were they disqualified for any violations.They were however Jewish and this was Nazi Germany which had adopted the Nuremberg laws limiting Jewish citizens' rights a year earlier. Apparently Cromwell along with leaders from the U.S. Olympic Committee decided it would be best if Glickman and Stoller did not compete.At the time I'm sure it seemed like a decision that would only hurt the two men. After all the 400 led by Owens still won gold.Today we know better.Today we look at that decision and lower our heads in shame understanding that it made us complicit with something that evolved into a far worse crime than unjustly replacing a pair of sprinters. In the moment when we should have spoken up we remained silent.JUST WATCHED Athletes: Sochi boycott not the answer Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Athletes: Sochi boycott not the answer 01:34JUST WATCHED Obama: Russia must respect gay rights Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Obama: Russia must respect gay rights 02:22JUST WATCHED Olympians jeer Russia's anti-gay law Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Olympians jeer Russia's anti-gay law 06:41And so here we are again: an Olympics on the horizon another host country with recently legislated laws persecuting a group of people and for a while we were silent. And then Tuesday happened.""I've been very clear that when it comes to universal rights when it comes to people's basic freedoms that whether you are discriminating on the basis of race religion gender or sexual orientation you are violating the basic morality that I think should transcend every country"" Obama said going on to talk about how Russia's treatment of lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people goes against the spirit of the Olympics.He did not call for a boycott.But on Wednesday he canceled a one-on-one meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin planned for September. The White House cited Russia's decision to grant asylum to National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden and ""lack of progress on issues such as missile defense and arms control"" among other reasons. But it also mentioned human rights issues.Recently U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry received a letter from 88 members of Congress -- Republicans and Democrats -- urging him to do something to guarantee the safety of LGBT Americans visiting Russia during that time. That leaves 447 lawmakers we should be asking why they did not sign that letter.Last month Buzzfeed provided the world photos of LGBT people being violently beaten by anti-gay protesters and police in Russia.Russian officials have said they don't condone the attacks but police have stood by while they happened and then arrested the battered victims for being gay. And because it is unclear whether or not the anti-gay laws will be enforced during the Olympics the safety of all Americans -- because you can be arrested if police think you look gay or even if you support gays -- is in question.Which brings me to: Why aren't the names of all 535 members of Congress on that letter?In talking about the 1936 Olympics I do not equate what is happening in Russia to what happened to Jewish people during World War II. I just want to remind you that the Holocaust did not happen overnight. It was subtle.Surgical.In silence.These new anti-gay laws are disturbingly similar to the anti-Semitic Nuremberg laws Hitler passed before the 1936 Olympics. And with the Pew Institute finding 84% of Russians believe society should reject gay people perhaps some saying they object to gays for fear of arrest the world should question how far Russia intends to go.We should question how far Russia our lukewarm ally intends to go and what our participation in the 2014 Olympic Games will look like generations from now.In one of his final interviews before passing away in 2001 Glickman told the San Diego Jewish Press-Heritage that there had been some talk of boycotting the 1936 Olympics because of Hitler but no one foresaw what would happen to the Jews a short time later.""There is no way in the world that I would think of going to Nazi Germany"" he said. ""The Holocaust and those things around Nazi Germany which we all loathe weren't in existence in 1936.""No one can predict the future. But this week Obama showed he learned an important lesson from our Olympic past -- offering silence to appease evil is a senseless endeavor because evil will never be satisfied. Now it's our turn to speak up. There are 447 members of Congress who have yet to sign that letter to Kerry -- we need to be asking why.Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.",0
112,"One of the original stories is at here AlternetThe Presidential Inauguration Committee announced Tuesday that the President Obama has selected Pastor Louie Giglio of the Georgia-based Passion City Church to deliver the benediction for his second inauguration. In a mid-1990s sermon identified as Giglio’s available online on a Christian training Web site he preached rabidly anti-LGBT views. The 54-minute sermon entitled “In Search of a Standard – Christian Response to Homosexuality” advocates for dangerous “ex-gay” therapy for gay and lesbian people references a biblical passage often interpreted to require gay people be executed and impels Christians to “firmly respond to the aggressive agenda” and prevent the “homosexual lifestyle”I can tell you that one of the most hurtful parts of the first Obama administration was asking to have Rick Warren speak at his inaugural. He was giving a platform to someone who spread hate when there were so many other choices there. It was greatly resented by many in the LGBT community. In fact it set off a chain of events (Rev. Robinson ""accidentally"" not being shown on live TV etc.) which got Obama off on very bad footing with many in the LGBT community.Following McClurkin I was very angry with Obama. Then came Warren. But apparently Obama/the inaugural team haven't learned anything:From above Alternet piece:(17:37) Men women I can’t say anything other to you tonight than this that if you look at the counsel of the word of God Old Testament New Testament you come quickly to the conclusion that homosexuality is not an alternate lifestyle… homosexuality is not just a sexual preference homosexuality is not gay but homosexuality is sin. It is sin in the eyes of God and it is sin according to the word of God. You come to only one conclusion: homosexuality is less than God’s best for his creation. It is less than God’s best for us and everything in our lives that is less than God’s best for us and his plan for us and his design for us is sin. That’s God’s voice. If you want to hear God’s voice that is his voice to this issue of homosexuality. It is not ambiguous and unclear. It is very clear.There are numerous other very incendiary quotes.So let me address the naysayers now:- But Obama has done so much for LGBT rights it's just a speaker at the InaugurationUm first if you are trying to make improving LGBT rights a cornerstone of your presidency you don't have to spit in the eye of the people you are supposedly trying to help. This is a PERSONAL choice. Hagel I can somewhat justify because there are other plusses to his candidacy. This is Obama picking yet another bigot when there could be much better choices out there who were/are not so vehemently anti-gayAlso when will he get past this bullshit of making in-roads with these people? These people will always vote against him and his agenda. Why give the marquee moment to a hater- But but he said those things long agoYeah and those are the seeds of hatred which were sown in the very people today who support discrimination against LGBT people.Also if Shirley Sherrod is up for scrutiny for what she didn't even say Hagel for his homophobic remarks they why should this guy not be held accountable as would anything with a history of anti-African American anti-woman anti-Hispanic anti- remarks. Yeah the times are changing and its time for the haters and the Vichy apologists to be held accountable for hating when it was a much bigger trend.And for what it's worth I am against Hagel ALSO for this reason. As Maddow pointed out there will be many many issues involving LGBT people in the military coming up. So he should answer for his bigotry then. Yet another reason why he is a bad choice.- But but Obama has a GAY CUBAN poet speakingAnd this argument pisses me off most of all. In Obama and Co's mind if you put up a minority group that cancels out makes ok having the hater up there. No it doesn't. You don't have a ""mixed program"" by putting up people who have advanced society like Ms. Evers and those who have held it back. Once again we'll likely have an inauguration with the usual symbolic winks and nods to the LGBT community while the hater gets a front row seat.Starting off Obama II in a sucky way like he started off Obama I. Except he can't blame Boehner for this one. A fucking huge disappointment.",0
113,"1 / 28 Pat Robertson: Gays With Aids Wear Rings To Cut Infect OthersPat Robertson made an <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pat-robertson-aids-rings_n_3824401"" target=""_blank"">outrageous comment</a> in August 2013 on an episode of the 700 club in which he claimed that gay people suffering from AIDS in cities such as San Francisco wear ""special rings"" that allow them to cut and infect other individuals with the disease. Right Wing Watch reported that particular comment from the broadcast was edited out of the clip the Christian Broadcasting Network later posted online. The Huffington Post could not immediately reach a CBN representative for comment. “You know what they do in San Francisco? Some in the gay community there they want to get people.

114,Nothing “Duck Dynasty” patriarch Phil Robertson said was anything close to anti-gay. It might have been characteristically blunt but Robertson neither singled out homosexuals nor questioned the humanity of gay people. Robertson focused on sexual behavior including the sexual behavior of heterosexuals. The major media are merely using Robertson’s quotes to advance their own anti-Christian bigotry by smearing Christian beliefs as de facto bigotry and launching a McCarthyist campaign to silence Christians.When you have major media outlets declaratively describing Robertson’s expression of his Christian beliefs as “anti-gay” what you are really seeing is major media outlets outing themselves as anti-Christian.Politico. CNN. The Hollywood Reporter. Entertainment Weekly. Yahoo. Variety. And so on…Robertson listed more than a half-dozen sins other than homosexual behavior including a number of heterosexual behaviors and “the greedy the drunkards the slanderers the swindlers”.It is certainly possible to try to disguise anti-gay bigotry as Christianity. Singling out gay people and not distinguishing between homosexuals as people and homosexual behavior are two of the most glaring examples.But Robertson did neither. What he did do was to speak a Christian truth about various sins and the media know this.Anti-sin is not anti-gay.But because the media and left are desperate to toxify Christianity as bigotry and bully Christians into silence Robertson’s remarks are seen as the perfect opportunity to do both.Of course it is an added benefit to the media to try to tarnish a culturally conservative mega-hit and maybe drive it off the air.What we have here is nothing more than the media practicing McCarthyism and disguising it as tolerance.Notice how the media are not reporting on the most important thing Robertson said:You put in your article that the Robertson family really believes strongly that if the human race loved each other and they loved God we would just be better off. We ought to just be repentant turn to God and let’s get on with it and everything will turn around.Governor Sarah Palin put this exactly right when she said this is an attack on “all of us.”This post has been updated to add a correct Robertson quote about loving the human race.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC,0
115,I’m sorry did I miss something?Is Hillary Clinton the Democrats’ presumptive 2016 presidential nominee just now coming out now in support of gay marriage? How weird.How is it possible that Sen. Rob Portman a Republican stalwart who hails from the most conservative part of Ohio beat her to the punch last week?The gay marriage issue is just turning this world upside down.As the U.S. Supreme Court considers whether to overturn California’s law against gay marriage and the federal Defense of Marriage Act every influential voice matters.Certainly the justices are not immune to the pull of history. They undoubtedly know that in the last 10 years support for legalizing gay marriage has leapt. In the most recent ABC News/Washington Post poll http://www.langerresearch.com/uploads/1147a5GayMarriage.pdf 58% support it vs. 37% a decade ago.President Obama has been out in favor of gay marriage for months so it’s not as if the issue’s embrace by another high-profile liberal is going to make a difference to the justices. And Hillary can’t even be said to be a leader in her own family; both her husband Bill and daughter Chelsea are on record supporting gay marriage. Was anyone anywhere holding his or her breath that Hillary would not support gay marriage?By contrast if you want to talk about courage if you want to know who really put something on the line to support gay marriage talk about Portman a man whose anti-gay marriage cred is nothing short of impeccable. He was a cosponsor of the federal Defense of Marriage Act and has long espoused the idea that heterosexual-only marriage is a core value.You can tick right down through the Republican platform and find virtually nothing with which this man disagrees. His party loyalty is one of the main reasons -- besides being a native of a swing state -- that Mitt Romney came close to choosing him as his running mate last year. This is a man who simply does not color outside the political lines.Until now.Two years ago his oldest child Will told his parents Rob and Jane that he is gay. And that it was not a choice. In an op-ed for the Columbus Dispatch Portman said he had decided to support gay marriage because of Will who is now a freshman at Yale.“Ronald Reagan said all great change in America begins at the dinner table and that’s been the case in my family” wrote Portman. “With the overwhelming majority of young people in support of allowing gay couples to marry in some respects the issue has become more generational than partisan.'Portman a freshman senator who is up for reelection in 2016 is the only Republican in the Senate who supports gay marriage.Despite surveys showing increasing support in the U.S. for gay marriage Ohio conservatives have clung to the fact that in 2004 a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage passed in their state with 62% of the vote.The chairman of the Ohio Republican Party has said publicly the party will stand by Portman. Closer to Portman’s home in Cincinnati Hamilton County GOP Chairman Alex Triantafilou said many younger Republicans are excited but “a very vocal group of strong social conservatives” has made its displeasure known.“Rob is so beloved here and so respected that he’s getting a lot of personal support” said Triantafilou. “I don’t know that he will lead a revolution on this topic right away though.”Indeed. “It’s gonna cost him his seat” predicted Phil Burress president of Citizens for Community Values a conservative evangelical group. Burress told me Monday that Portman a good friend for decades called him to share his change of heart about gay marriage the night before he went public.Portman started off by saying he had “some bad news” and sounded depressed said Burress who “nearly dropped the phone” when Portman told him the reason for his call.,1
116,FILE - In this Monday Dec. 2 2013 file photo Shaun Campbell left and Tony Singh are congratulated by guests after their wedding at the Sheraton Waikiki in Honolulu. Hawaii became the 15th state to legalize same-sex marriage. The last six months of 2013 have provided a frenzy of court decisions and laws in favor of gay marriage punctuated by a ruling in heavily Mormon Utah that has allowed hundreds of same-sex couples to wed in the last week. The U.S. Supreme Court opened the floodgates with its June ruling that overturned a 1996 ban on gay marriage and the change has been swift. Judges in Utah New Mexico and Ohio have all ruled in favor of gay marriage in the past week. (AP Photo/Marco Garcia File)SALT LAKE CITY (RNS) -- In the week since a federal judge overturned Utah’s ban on same-sex marriage the number of weddings in the state has skyrocketed shattering records and accruing thousands of dollars for Utah’s 29 counties.As of close of business Thursday (Dec. 26) more than 1225 marriage licenses had been issued in Utah since last Friday (Dec. 20). Of those at least 74 percent or 905 licenses were issued to gay and lesbian couples.Marriage licenses in Utah cost between $30 and $50 depending on the county.With an average marriage license costing $40 counties in Utah made a grand total of more than $49000 in the three-and-a-half days most county clerk’s offices were open this week.About three-quarters of that money came from gay and lesbian couples seeking marriage licenses in the immediate aftermath of U.S. District Judge Robert J. Shelby’s ruling that overturned a statewide ban on same-sex marriages.Salt Lake County shattered a previously held record of 85 marriages in a given day by handing out 353 on Monday (Dec. 23) — the first full day of issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.On the other hand Piute a small county of about 1500 people in the center of the state was of several counties with no takers. Had any Piute couples requested a license they would have been denied anyway.County Clerk Valeen Brown is on vacation until Monday (Dec. 30) officials said. So Piute officials suspended all marriage license activity until Brown returns.Utah County — which made national news this week when Shelly Eyre and her partner Cheryl Haws declared that they would sue its clerk for denying gay and lesbian couples — was doling out certificates Thursday to all.“Moving forward we probably won’t keep track of how many same-sex couples versus opposite-sex couples we issue licenses to” said Bryan Thompson the county’s clerk and auditor. “I don’t see any reason to differentiate between them.”(Marissa Lang writes for The Salt Lake Tribune.),0
117,"8 years ago(CNN) – Conservatives who oppose same-sex marriage must accept that they’ve “lost the issue” radio host Rush Limbaugh argued Thursday.“This issue is lost” the conservative firebrand said. “I don't care what the Supreme Court does this is now inevitable - and it's inevitable because we lost the language on this. “Limbaugh went on to assert conservatives “lost the issue when we started allowing the word ‘marriage’ to be bastardized and redefined by simply adding words to it.”“Marriage is one thing and it was not established on the basis of discrimination” he continued. “It wasn't established on the basis of denying people anything. ‘Marriage’ is not a tradition that a bunch of people concocted to be mean to other people with. But we allowed the left to have people believe that it was structured that way. “The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the legality of same-sex marriage earlier this week.Another notable conservative Fox News host Bill O’Reilly said on Tuesday that same-sex marriage advocates have a more convincing argument than opponents who do nothing but rehash scripture to make their point.""The compelling argument is on the side of homosexuals"" O'Reilly said Tuesday on Fox. ""That's where the compelling argument is. 'We're Americans. We just want to be treated like everybody else.' That's a compelling argument and to deny that you have got to have a very strong argument on the other side. The argument on the other side hasn't been able to do anything but thump the Bible.""O'Reilly has previously stated he takes a libertarian view on the issue and repeated Tuesday night that it's a decision that should be left up to the states. ""I support civil unions. I always have. The gay marriage thing I don't feel that strongly about it one way or another.""",0
118,"Maryland state legislator Don Dwyer is a religious conservative who has called himself ""the face of the opposition"" to gay marriage chastising fellow legislators to reject it because Jeebus and stuff. Most Americans however know this self-proclaimed defender of the Constitution and freedoms and whatnot mostly from his alcohol-fueled boating crash last year (and yes there were injuries and yes he's still facing charges).In this new miserably depressing story on Dwyer he cites two things as the reasons for the ""increased"" drinking that culminated in his crash with another boat causing him multiple injuries and fracturing the skull of a five-year-old girl. The first is his 2011 separation from his wife. The second is the pressure of being in the legislature but more specifically that time other legislators ""betrayed"" him by not being sufficiently anti-gay-marriage themselves:Dwyer says he felt sold out when Dels. Tiffany Alston Wade Kach and Bob Costa voted for same-sex marriage an issue he spent years crusading against. Dwyer told reporters one day before the vote that he had enough support to block the bill. Kach a Republican from Baltimore County and Alston a former Democrat from Prince George’s County voted against the bill in committee. But Kach changed his vote after hearing testimony from gay couples. Alston shifted her vote after her amendment was adopted. Kach and Costa of Deale were the only two House Republicans to vote for the bill. It passed the House by two votes in February. “I had no time to do anything” Dwyer said. “Had I known earlier I could have taken some action.” It was petitioned to the November ballot and passed by 52 percent of voters state wide. Voters in Dwyer’s district however rejected it. “That betrayal really affected me” he said. “I was physically ill. You pour your heart into an issue like that and it’s devastating.” He said his drinking culminated in the crash.So an intense hatred of gay marriage—and not having that hatred reciprocated by his fellow legislators and voters—is what drove this poor defender of proper marriage and proper faith to booze up and crash his damn boat into another boat. That's some powerful hatred right there.In the wake of the crash Dwyer did not resign as any decent person might instead gaudily announcing he needs to stay put to ""defend individual liberty against unconstitutional laws"" but he does admit he needs to rebuild ""trust"" with voters. I don't know that voters should be keen on reelecting someone whose past reaction to other people being insufficiently anti-gay was to booze up and nearly get some people killed but I am not from Maryland I am not a Republican voter and Dwyer seems confident that all will be forgiven allowing him to get back to expressing his obsessively anti-gay frustrations in some hopefully less child-skull-fracturing ways.And that ladies and gentlemen is what it means to be an American religious conservative.",0
119,House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi suddenly an expert on the Constitution said on Wednesday that she and Barack Obama are “honoring the Constitution” in their attacks on the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). Pelosi pontificated:And given a choice I think we would all say we’re honoring as the president does the Constitution. When you pass a bill in the House as we did with the health care bill we made it iron clad constitutionally. You have a responsibility to honor the Constitution. In fact we take an oath to do just that and that is the oath that President Obama is upholding.Attacking the GOP’s support for the Defense of Marriage Act Pelosi whined:We weigh equities. Congress passes a bill. It’s questionable in terms of constitutionality. There’s no question about your oath to the Constitution of the United States and the behavior of the Republicans in the House of Representatives on this subject has been so irresponsible. First of all why in this time would you pass a bill that increases discrimination? We’re going in the direction of the arc of Justice [Henry L.] Benning in favor of more justice not more discrimination. Why would you do such a thing in the first place? And then when it is questioned in terms of its constitutionality to spend money in the tune of millions outside the regular order of how that money should be spent to defend increasing discrimination in our society it’s just plain wrong. And given a choice I think we would all say we’re honoring as the president does the Constitution.Pelosi boasted of her home city’s influence in the assault on traditional values claiming that same-sex marriage is “inevitable.” She continued:From our beautiful place in San Francisco the city of St. Francis we knew that it was inevitable that all of this would happen. It was inconceivable to others that it would and it was our job to use whatever influence we could have to shorten the distance between the inevitable and the inconceivable. And I think that’s what’s happening at the court because of many people’s courage especially those directly personally affected.,1
120,"I personally think that our country has much bigger problems than debating gay marriage. Severe obesity soaring healthcare costs poverty starving children immigration texting and driving to name a few. You will change your profile pic to show that you are supportive - but what are you ACTUALLY doing to help our country? I promise the supreme court doesn't care about your Facebook profile picture.Every time I see a Facebook status or a tweet that reads like this:I know right away that the person behind the words has no tangible friendship or touchable connection with a person who is gay. I know that the person is speaking from a place devoid of the sort of empathy that comes from truly connecting with a person who is being deprived of rights.Because let me tell you why I changed my profile picture to that small meaningless speck of red peppered with two horizontal bars. I did it not because I think it's going to influence Justice Kennedy's legal opinion. I'm a few months shy of being a lawyer so I'm in as good a position as anyone to know that matters like this are decided in the reaches of highly analytical and highly calculated minds that sit under black robes.No. I change my profile picture because I have friends who are gay. I have former co-workers who've displayed to me their humanity through their professionalism and their skill. I have friends who I've sat with to discuss the ways in which real-world bigotry keeps them from enjoying a full life. These are people I respect and they are people who deserve respect.And they should know that in their fight in their battle for equality they are not alone. I can't imagine what it must have been like to have been a black person during the 1960s fighting out of second-hand citizenship to a place of at least some equality. If I had been there and I had been black I I might have looked to some of the people I thought were friends and I might have said: ""Are you out there?""I change my profile picture because unlike you conservative who is only concerned about concepts like ""children starving"" and ""poverty"" when it helps you make a point about the triviality of gay marriage I understand that the freedom of each of us is tied to the freedom of everyone. It's that unmalleable concept that says to my gay friends: your liberation is bound up with mine.I change my profile picture not because I've forgotten that there are big problems in the world. To the contrary it's because I remember that our problems are big and big problems are only solved by groups of people with the conviction to stand up with one another and for one another. Because during a day when I might advocate for protections for the poor I can take a few seconds out to show my gay brothers and sisters that they are loved respected and worthy of support. It's not because I'm some great ambassador for gay rights. It's them my friends so willing to fight for their own rights who are the heroes and if I can do the smallest something to show them that they're not on an island then I will do that.My profile picture didn't change because I think such a change will change the world. It changed because I'm lucky enough to have tangible relationships with real people whose lives are dramatically affected by this movement. And I'm sorry that you don't.",0
121,It seems these days as if everyone is speculating about how Justice Anthony M. Kennedy will approach the two same-sex marriage cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. But I haven’t heard anyone wondering which side Antonin Scalia will be on. He has made his views on gay relationships painfully clear.In December Scalia spoke at Princeton University where I am a freshman and I asked him about language he used in past decisions involving gay rights — language that I as a gay man found extraordinarily offensive.AdvertisementIn my question I quoted from two of Scalia’s opinions (both of them dissents). One passage came from the case of Romer vs. Evans which involved a Colorado statute banning laws that recognized gay people as a protected class. Scalia wrote: “I had thought that one could consider certain conduct reprehensible — murder for example or polygamy or cruelty to animals — and could exhibit even ‘animus’ toward such conduct. Surely that is the only sort of ‘animus’ at issue here: moral disapproval of homosexual conduct.”PHOTOS: Battle of the gay marriage signsAdvertisementI asked if he had come to regret that language. He hadn’t. In response to my question he posed two questions of his own: “If we cannot have moral feelings against homosexuality can we have it against murder? Can we have it against these other things?”I hadn’t really expected Scalia to apologize for his language. He has been remarkably consistent over his judicial career. Still I had hoped and continue to hope that my question might lead Scalia to think about the language he uses in the soon-to-be-decided cases of U.S. vs. Windsor and Hollingsworth vs. Perry which will determine the fates respectively of the federal Defense of Marriage Act and California’s Proposition 8. I know from personal experience that poisonous language like Scalia’s can be devastatingly hurtful.AdvertisementGrowing up in Northern California I struggled to accept the fact that I was gay. I was labeled a “faggot” in middle school too many times to count. I listened to my neighbor explain how California needed Proposition 8 to “protect the children.” I heard my grandfather declare that San Francisco’s gay community was “just different from the rest of us.” Those words hurt and honestly they still do. Although I am very close to my parents I only felt comfortable coming out to them a month before putting my question to Scalia.TIMELINE: Gay marriage chronologyAdvertisementMore than half of LGBT youth report having been verbally assaulted or attacked with anti-gay slurs. For some it leaves a permanent scar. For others it proves too much to handle which is why an appallingly high number of gay teens commit suicide.I tell myself that verbal assaults are rooted in ignorance. But I still haven’t figured out how to reassure myself when the ignorance is emanating from the nation’s highest court. In the 2003 case of Lawrence vs. Texas the Supreme Court overturned a Texas law banning sodomy. Scalia’s dissent in the case joined by Justice Clarence Thomas and then-Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist embraced the idea that citizens should be able to pass laws banning sexual behavior they find “immoral and unacceptable” including such things as “adult incest bestiality and obscenity.”AdvertisementI have every confidence that history will judge Scalia harshly and that one day it will be unacceptable to equate laws against consensual gay sex with laws against incest and bestiality. But I still worry about the impact of his language in the here and now.OPINION L.A.: For Scalia no gay people just gay sex?AdvertisementIn the next couple of months the court will issue its rulings on Proposition 8 and the Defense of Marriage Act and we’re likely to hear more of his views on the morality of gay relationships. Still I can’t help but hope that this time he will consider how words have the potential to lead people to desperation and self-destruction. Wouldn’t it be great if Scalia surprised us this time?Duncan Hosie is a freshman at Princeton University.,0
122,"Catalina CamiaUSA TODAYAlaska senator says she supports right of people %22to marry the person they love and choose%22Murkowski joins GOP Sens. Rob Portman and Mark Kirk to back gay marriageSupreme Court is considering two cases dealing with controversial issueWASHINGTON -- Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska has endorsed same-sex marriage becoming the third Republican senator to do so.In a statement posted Wednesday on her website Murkowski said supporting same-sex marriage is consistent with her values as a ""lifelong Republican"" who believes in ""promoting freedom and limiting the reach of government.""""I support the right of all Americans to marry the person they love and choose because I believe doing so promotes both values: it keeps politicians out of the most private and personal aspects of people's lives -- while also encouraging more families to form and more adults to make a lifetime commitment to one another"" she said.Murkowski joins Republican Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio and Mark Kirk of Illinois to voice support for the right of same-sex couples to marry. The highly charged issue is taking on new importance as the Supreme Court considers two cases dealing with gay marriage.The justices who are trying to complete work this month before their summer break could rule as early as Thursday on California's gay marriage ban and the federal Defense of Marriage Act.The Human Rights Campaign a gay rights advocacy group praised Murkowski who had said earlier this year that her views on gay marriage were ""evolving.""""Senator Murkowski's courageous and principled announcement today sends a clear message that marriage equality must come to all 50 state in this country"" said Chad Griffin president of the Human Rights Campaign. ""As the Supreme Court prepares to rule in two landmark marriage cases this month a growing bipartisan coalition is standing up for the right of all couples to marry -- and there is no turning back that tide.""Several senators who were previously opposed or on the fence issued statements supporting gay marriage in March as the court heard arguments in the two marriage lawsuits.In her statement Murkowski said she was influenced in part by an Alaskan family headed by two lesbians who have adopted four siblings to give them a home together. ""This first-class Alaskan family still lives a second-class existence"" she wrote.Murkowski who is Catholic said she believes religious institutions should have the right to define marriage on their own terms. But she is clear about the government's role.""Churches must be allowed to define marriage and conduct ceremonies according to their rules"" she said ""but the government should not tell people who they have a right to marry through a civil ceremony.""Follow @ccamia on Twitter.",1
123,"The ""debate"" really speaks for itself. There's not much to add except that this homophobe got his ass handed to him by Wahls and walked away from the segment looking like a complete jackass. Watch and enjoy:For those who can't watch here's a transcript:Whelan: Not at all. In fact I think the example I give indicates exactly the opposite. Look what's at issue here is that we have an organization that has long stood in defense of traditional American moral values and it's attracted supporters and parents from churches precisely because it has stood in defense of those values. The Supreme Court has held that the Boy Scouts have a First Amendment constitutional right to pursue their values and to exclude leaders whose presence would be inconsistent with those values. That includes by the way not just gays but atheists. Now we can respect and we do respect our fellow citizens who are gays or atheists. We love our relatives or friends who are gays or atheists. But we are not obligated to regard them as suitable to be Scout leaders.Host: Hm. All right well let me ask Zach to weigh in here. Zach?Wahls: Yeah I think it's interesting that Ed is going to this you know traditional moral values framework. I think what he is trying to do is define this as some particular biblical literal fundamentalist tradition that has become popular in the U.S. over the last forty years. The reality is that there are Christians of all different denominations who are applauding the BSA for this proposed policy change including the United Church of Christ one of the BSA's top eight church sponsors which on Friday issued a statement saying ""The ban is inconsistent with the values of dignity and respect which serve as the foundation of the Scouting program"" and we couldn't agree more. Even though Ed may be talking about respect respect for him is a one-way street. Nobody is calling for the exclusion of Baptists or Mormons or Catholics or frankly anybody who even holds Ed's point of view. What we're trying to say is that Scouts should be an inclusive program experiencing you know a large amount of inclusivity because we believe in the values that constitute the program.Host: Let me ask you about this woman Ed--Jennifer Tyrell. She was kicked out of the Scouts. She is a lesbian mom who was a den leader for her son. Is she a threat?Whelan: Look the question here is whether a private organization can have its own standards for for its leaders.Host: But answer that question first if you will. Is she a threat?Whelan: I don't know this particular woman. How could I possibly judge whether she's a threat? The fact of the matter is that organizations have all sorts of general rules that they adopt because the rules are sensible and we don't have to defend every single application of every particular rule. The problem here is that the Boy Scouts if they adopt this notion that different troops can have different policies it's completely unworkable it's going to invite legal attacks on the troops that maintain the traditional policies and Zach and his cohorts are not going to call a peace truce. They're going to realize that the Boy Scouts can be intimidated and they're going to continue to intimidate them and this is an unstable stopping point--it's just a path to further surrender.Wahls: Speaking as an Eagle Scout and somebody who actually spent twelve years in the organization I simply have to disagree. We're appealing to the traditional values that have been a part of the Boy Scouts from their very inception in 1903 and I feel that moving forward this is going to be a part of the program that is fostering inclusiveness and applying the values and the lifelong principles of the Boy Scouts to the entire you know population of young American men not just those who happen to be straight. And further on your point of whether or not this is something that is an unworkable legal solution on a national call with the key three of the Boy Scouts earlier this week the president of the board said ""With the current ban in place we don't want to find ourselves in a position in which a judge is telling us that we need to expand our policy even further than we're going here."" So even though you might be you know looking at this in one specific way the BSA certainly isn't taking that position at all.Host: Ed let me ask you because I know you mentioned this change in policy would deprive the troops of protection. Protection from what? What do they need protection from?Whelan: They need protection from legal challenges to their decision to exclude gay leaders. The national Supreme Court organization won that victory thirteen years ago. They're throwing it away in a way that would expose local troops and volunteer leaders to lawsuits by activists like Zach.Host: Would you want your son to be in the Scouts if he was gay?Whelan: [long pause] Uh I think a question like that directed at my son is a rude question but let me answer it this way. I would not have put my son in a troop with an openly gay leader or an openly atheist leader. And lots and lots of other parents the most vibrant part of the Boy Scouts feel the same. So Zach can cite you know one liberal denomination that is satisfied with this proposal. There are plenty of other folks who aren't and I think the Boy Scouts--Wahls: That's an interesting point--Whelan: Please let me finish. This I think would be an epic failure in leadership if they were to cave to the financial pressure that Zach and others are putting on them. This isn't a decision being made on the merits--this is a decision that is being made in the face of financial pressure the almighty buck and what sort of lesson is it to Scouts that the national organization would cave because of financial pressure rather than adhere to principle?Host: Let me let Zach jump in here with the final word.Wahls: I mean yeah to be clear it's not just the UCC that has weighed in. Currently the Mormon Church and Catholic Church hardly denominations known for their liberal stances have both declined to comment. Only the Baptists--Whelan: [angrily] They're not going to approve this! Don't you dare suggest they're going to approve this!Host: Ed let Zach finish.Wahls: No I mean the point is simply that while there may be some who are you know very opposed to this policy position there is a vast difference between being opposed to gay marriage and opposing the enrichment and development of young men because they happen to be not straight. So while I think Ed's position is you know certainly one that I will respect and we're not going to remove his son from the program I think he should understanding that Scouts is about respecting the opinions of all the people who want to be members not just some.Whelan: You're not respecting it you're trying to--Host: Appreciate your time. Appreciate both of you discussing this this morning. Thank you.",0
124,“If Jesus were alive today he would be more inclined to say ‘you know I didn’t know it all…'” – Rev. Oliver White Sean Hannity Show March 27 2013In general most news outlets have provided awful coverage of the Supreme Court proceedings on same-sex marriage. Covering the proceedings like they cover a political campaign or a sporting event most of the analysis and commentary has been about political “wins” for one side or the other and the ramifications of the pending decision on homosexuals in our society rather than the wide-ranging ramifications for society itself.Filling the void of thoughtful analysis has been talk radio. Unlike the vapid and two-dimensional conversations repeated every ten minutes on cable talk radio has been able to explore larger questions entwined in the same-sex marriage debate and have been able to challenge the politically correct orthodoxy presented in other media outlets where it comes to the religious side of the issue.Enter Sean Hannity whose Wednesday show featured a fascinating exchange with Terry Jeffrey a news editor from CNS News Service and Rev. Oliver White a pro-same sex marriage pastor. Because Hannity is not constrained by the limitations of a TV news schedule and the need to change subjects every 5 minutes as is so often the case on cable news he was able to allow the on-air debate over the scriptural basis for marriage to naturally unfold to the point where the lack of scriptural foundation for same-sex marriage was laughingly evident.This exchange in particular was the most glaringly infuriating as White a proponent of same-sex marriage who angered his own congregation recently because of his adamant belief that Christianity supports such a practice went so far as to agree that Jesus Christ was wrong about His position on marriage being defined as one man and one woman and if Jesus were alive today he would in fact support gay marriage.In this segment the good minister is quizzed further on his unique and ever-morphing interpretation of scripture by Hannity and it’s revealed for the audience that his understanding of sin and morality is quite pliable and able to bend to meet any modern need:Finally Rev. White is able to admit that he does draw moral lines with regard to sexuality but those lines are rooted less in God’s law but in the current popular practices of the times we live in:This is the kind of exchange full of thoughtful and challenging questions that force the guests and the listener to re-examine what they believe and what they espouse can only happen in a medium like talk radio and new media where hosts are able to take positions and not pretend to be objective. We know there is no real objectivity when Don Lemon or Anderson Cooper are conducting an interview on this topic. Cooper would probably never have Rev. White on in the first place because he would make the pro-same sex marriage side look bad. And if he did have a minister on to discuss the biblical basis for same-sex unions there is no chance that Don Lemon would be able to pose questions for their guest in the way that Hannity and Jeffry did.In general cable and network news have not served the public interest in exploring these complicated and important issues because in many cases the hosts and anchors assigned to the topic are just not equipped or are completely unwilling to have both sides of the issue get a fair and through hearing.Congratulations to Sean Hannity for taking advantage of his medium and shedding light on an angle of this story that’s been neglected by his TV counterparts.,1

Board of Education the landmark 1954 Supreme Court ruling that ended segregation. The issue: gay marriage. Any day now the U.S. Supreme Court will issue rulings on two cases one determining states' rights to define marriage and the other questioning the role of the federal government in recognizing same-sex unions.And while Mississippians answered the question of gay marriage in 2004 by overwhelmingly approving a state constitutional amendment banning the practice the aftershock of the Supreme Court rulings on California's Proposition 8 and the federal Defense of Marriage Act could weaken or obliterate the state's stance on the issue.Or the nation's high court could reaffirm what Mississippi and 30 other states already have done in passing the bans.Which way the typically 5-4 split court is leaning is anybody's guess.Three Mississippi couples explain their experiences.Leslie & Cheryl: A life of laughter loveThe story of Leslie Criss and Cheryl Sproles began decades ago when a neighborly gesture formed a friendship that would last forever.They didn't know the chance encounter would end with a happily ever after. But then again who sees Cupid's arrow before it hits?A few decades ago Criss was home for the summer from college visiting her family in Brookhaven Miss. The Criss clan had just moved to the area and there was concern that Criss' younger sister Beth wouldn't know anyone at school.Family friends hatched a plan. Sproles would go meet Beth and befriend her ensuring she didn't start the new academic year at the local school without any friends.""She knocks on the door and my sister and I – both shy girls – answer the door where she says 'Hi I'm Cheryl Sproles. I'm the most popular girl in town and I'm here to be your friend' "" said Criss.There were no fireworks no pledges of undying love no Pavarotti playing in the background. The shy girl and the popular girl became friends and nothing more.As the years passed the friendship remained intact. Criss spent time in Los Angeles a move she said she felt she needed to get out of her system. Sproles moved to New York City to pursue acting. Life happened and the two went right along with it.Eventually both of their paths led them back to Mississippi.When she was 39 Criss said she admitted something to herself that she spent a lifetime denying.""I knew when I was a third-grader a shy scared third-grader I knew that something was different about me"" Criss said. ""But I knew instinctively that whatever made me know I was different was something that I should shove deep inside and never talk about.""A conversation with an Episcopalian minister in Corinth Miss. was her next step she said. ""It was the most freeing empowering moment of my life.""Meanwhile Sproles had her own personal journey to find herself.""With me I didn't have any idea"" she said. ""I guess some people know it in the third grade. I was living in New York. I knew it was a lifestyle or something (but) being raised in the Baptist Church it was not a possibility.""When I moved to New York and was introduced to different faiths and different people it was just kind of eye-opening"" Sproles said. ""I don't want to make it sound like New York made me realize I was gay but I had an intern and she said she had a crush on me and I had all these feelings happen.""Nearly six years ago Criss was at her job with the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal in Tupelo a job she still holds.Sproles had suffered a stroke a year before that eventually selling her business in Jackson and starting her recovery. One day while driving through Tupelo Sproles said she looked up her old friend.""I asked her out to lunch"" Sproles said. ""And we've been together pretty much ever since.""Sproles moved to Tupelo. About a year later the couple held a commitment ceremony.It was an experience Criss thought she'd never have.But there they were surrounded by family in a small ceremony that announced their intentions to live life to the fullest with each other.""I have never laughed as much as I have the last six years"" Criss said. ""We've had some sad times too.""""Yeah we have"" Sproles said.Nowadays the self-diagnosed shy Criss has an infectious grin on her face. The woman who had been content sitting in the audience stood on a theater stage during a recent production of ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" an idea encouraged by her theatrical partner.And Sproles a woman who has a million faces and hilarious quips pauses from time to time to stare lovingly at the woman who anchors her life while keeping her free spirit intact.It's the work of each woman wives in everything but name only.Amelie & Sabrina: A proud familyNorth Mississippi can be described as one of the most conservative areas in one of the most conservative states. But for Amelie Hahn and Sabrina Mays it's home.It's where the two met three years ago while working for the U.S. Census Bureau's big count. Mississippi — Houston specifically — is where the couple held a commitment ceremony.""She walked in and she wouldn't give me the time of day"" said Hahn of the couple's first encounter. ""I tried to talk to her and she wouldn't speak to me pay me any attention at all.""At their first meeting Hahn made paper footballs flipping them in Mays' direction. It was a schoolyard attempt to get a crush to look up.Instead Mays kept on texting focusing her attention on her phone she was holding underneath the table.Hahn however wasn't going to give up.She looked around and found a softball league choosing to get involved. Of course it didn't hurt that Mays was a player.And sometime between whizzing paper footballs past Mays' head to throwing softballs around together Hahn got the attention she wanted.She also got a partner.Mississippi is where the two hard-working moms raise their daughters Haley 14 and Jessa 13.And it's also a place where the family sometimes feels the sting of disapproval.""I don't like the dirty looks I don't like that when we walk by people talk about me"" Hahn said.""Most of my friends are pretty cool about it"" Jessa said. ""I've never had anyone not be my friend because of it.""There are a couple of friends whose parents don't allow their children to visit the Hahn-Mays house. ""But that's their problem"" Jessa said.Even with some of the stares the family is determined to stay put. At least in some part of Mississippi.""We're comfortable here"" said Hahn adding she and her family want to move to Jackson a place she describes as being more open than Houston and closer to the hospital where they take Haley a special needs child.In the meantime the family will continue to make an example of themselves a testament to their normalcy.""What we're going to have to do is make our presence known and get people to see us as human beings because that's what we are you know we're a family just like any other family"" Hahn said. ""We get up in the morning we eat breakfast the kids go to school she goes to work I start my school work.""And Hahn said her family is the reason she will stay and take a stand.""If we leave then that's one less couple to stand up and speak out.""Eddie & Justin: A living exampleGrowing up gay in the South isn't easy for many members of the LGBT community but the times they are changing.Eddie Outlaw and Justin McPherson have carved out their own little piece of Jackson the city where they have lived the last nine years. It's where their home is their friends are and their business operates.McPherson said the evidence can be seen by younger Mississippians able to come out in high school to openly discuss their sexuality with their parents.""I will put my life out there as an example of what this looks like"" said McPherson 32. ""It does get better.""When he was coming out as a teenager ""it was real bad then and it's done nothing but improve and will continue to improve.""""I guess for a teenager looking at what's happening right now -- from (President Barack Obama) to most of the Democrats in the Senate saying they are for marriage equality and overturning (the Defense of Marriage Act) it sends a message"" said Outlaw 41.McPherson said he wants to show that by owning a business while being openly gay that there is life after coming out.""I know what it's like growing up in the South. Eddie knows what its like to grow up in the South"" he said. ""I want to be an example for them for their parents.""""Instead of a paso doble"" said Outlaw referring to a traditional Spanish dance ""we've settled into a slow steady waltz.

127,"The New York Times calls for a ""50-state ruling"":Support now for same-sex marriage — more than half in favor about one-third against — is roughly the public divide on the question of public school desegregation in 1954 when the Supreme Court outlawed segregated schools in Brown v. Board of Education. But the court’s call then for states to end racial discrimination in public schools “with all deliberate speed” was a big error. It gave states far too much latitude to move slowly and gave them an excuse for resistance which delayed desegregation in many school districts for many years. The court should avoid that kind of error in the same-sex-marriage cases. It should broadly declare that under the Constitution the right to marry applies equally to all couples period and that this principle applies to the federal government and every state.The arguments of those defending discrimination against gay couples are beyond far-fetched. Proposition 8’s advocates for example contend that restricting marriage to heterosexual couples must be rational because for thousands of years people widely agreed that the institution involved only the union of a man and a woman. That reasoning stinks of the faulty logic used to justify the persistence of all sorts of discrimination. They also argue that marriage’s purpose is to ensure that children are born into stable families; therefore California should be allowed to limit marriage to only those capable of biological procreation. That is a narrow and insulting view of marriage. Would it then be constitutional to deny sterile heterosexual couples the right to marry? How about older couples? Moreover lesbians can bear children and gay men can adopt. Why wouldn’t society want their parents to be wed too?Statistically speaking Franklin County should be straighter than John Wayne eating Chick-fil-A. The middle-of-nowhere rectangle in southwest Mississippi -- known for its pine forests hog hunting and an infamous hate crime -- is home to exactly zero same-sex couples according to an analysis of census data. In other words: It's a place where gays don't exist. At least not on paper. [...] In a place where ""everybody knows everybody"" as Richard Pickett put it very few seem willing to talk about the possibility of gay residents. You could blame that on the would-be gays. ""If (a gay couple) did live together they would probably keep it quiet"" the 54-year-old told me. ""They're not going to march up and down the street with a sign"" announcing their homosexuality. The common Franklin County wisdom seems to be that gays like unicorns or dragons are living over the next pine-covered hill out of sight and out of mind. They're not my kids. Not my neighbors. They're somewhere else. Maybe. But here's the thing: There certainly are gay people in Franklin County. And for the most part they're not in the closet. Many are happy to talk about it. It's their neighbors and families who aren't.The GOP filibuster strategy is proving to be the tool of choice for draining momentum from President Obama’s reelection mandate. It stops the Democratic majority in the senate from controlling the Senate. And it makes it difficult for the president to put his nominees in place to govern the country. The GOP is betting that voters will blame Democrats for the dysfunction in Congress as much as they blame the GOP. And so far the bet is paying off because the press is failing to call out the GOP for an extreme and nasty political strategy of demanding a super-majority of 60 votes —the votes required to break a filibuster — to get anything done.A lawsuit the federal government filed against JP Morgan in late 2011 alleged the bank consistently overstated the quality of the loans it packaged into mortgage bonds; that it inflated home values to make mortgages seem safer than they were; and that JP Morgan and its brokers didn’t adhere to their own underwriting standards. Federal lawsuits against other Wall Street banks made similar claims. Post-crisis investigations have revealed that outside auditors told banks that they were handling bad mortgages but the banks stuffed them into bonds and sold them off anyway. The banks did all this while knowing they would have to own any mortgage fraud that investors discovered. Just imagine what they’ll be tempted to pull once they let themselves off that hook.There comes a point when some folks prove themselves so careless so consistently with the facts that the rest of us should have license to ignore any additional utterance ever to leak from their lips.

128,WASHINGTON — Public opinion on marriage for gay and lesbian couples has shifted with almost unprecedented speed since California voters banned such unions in 2008.That shift could influence the Supreme Court in particular Justice Anthony M. Kennedy and possibly Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. as it decides whether to uphold Proposition 8 in coming months.AdvertisementThroughout his long career Kennedy has been willing to make major changes in the law on issues including the death penalty gun rights and gay rights. Kennedy has been a strong steady proponent of constitutional principles such as free speech individual liberty and limits on government power.But before signing on to major changes — abolishing the death penalty for young murderers for example — he has wanted to feel comfortable thatthe change was in line with public opinion and the trend in the law.Advertisement“Among all the justices he is most concerned about public opinion” New York University law professor Barry Friedman said of Kennedy. “The more there is a groundswell of support for gay marriage the more it is likely he will vote to support it.”Kennedy along with others on the court probably would also resist going too fast. The current justices both liberals and conservatives say the court of the early 1970s made a mistake by striking down all state laws on abortion and capital punishment. Both decisions appeared to trigger a backlash and the death penalty was soon restored to law.AdvertisementBetter to move in line with — or just slightly ahead of — shifting opinion they believe.In California public opinion clearly has shifted since Proposition 8 passed in 2008 and banned same-sex marriage. A Field Poll survey released this week showed that California voters by a nearly 2-1 margin now approve of allowing same-sex couples to marry a finding in line with states that legalized gay marriage in November’s election.AdvertisementWith that shift lawyers supporting same-sex marriage have offered the justices a range of options they could use to rule in favor of gay rights. The Obama administration’s legal brief advocates a step-by-step approach.Commenting Friday on the administration’s filing in the case President Obama told reporters: “I do think that we’re seeing on a state-by-state basis progress being made — more and more states recognizing same-sex couples and giving them the opportunity to marry and maintain all the benefits of marriage that heterosexual couples do.” But he added the administration wanted to “answer the specific question” before the court — whether “the California law is unconstitutional.”AdvertisementIn providing that answer Solicitor Gen. Donald Verrilli Jr. drew on arguments he had filed with the court just a few days earlier saying the justices should strike down part of the Defense of Marriage Act which denies federal benefits to legally married gay couples in states such as Massachusetts. He advised the court to say that discrimination based on a person’s sexual orientation is highly suspect akin to gender bias. It can be justified only if a state can show a strong need to treat gays and lesbians differently than other citizens the administration argued.Verrilli’s brief filed Thursday applied that same approach in the Proposition 8 case. It argues that because California and seven other states — Delaware Hawaii Illinois Nevada New Jersey Oregon and Rhode Island — already have given gay couples full legal rights there is no justification for denying them a right to marry.AdvertisementThis is what some lawyers have dubbed the “eight-state solution.”Already nine other states and the District of Columbia authorize same-sex marriage. If the Supreme Court were to adopt the administration’s view it could raise the total to 17 mostly in the Northeast and on the West Coast.AdvertisementWhile this would be a significant ruling it would not require Justice Kennedy and his colleagues to mandate gay marriage in the red states where majority opinion continues to oppose it.The defenders of Proposition 8 also cite the change in public opinion but argue it is a reason for the court to stand aside. Because there is a great national debate over gay marriage and some states are changing their laws the court has no need to intervene they said.AdvertisementAndy Pugno general counsel for the Proposition 8 proponents said it was “very disappointing” that the Obama administration had urged the court to strike down the voter initiative. “The president has impugned the motives of millions of Californians” he said “and disregarded the rights of each state to decide for itself whether to redefine marriage.”If the court were to adopt a version of the eight-state solution it would allow most states to decide for themselves as Pugno advocates — at least for now. But it is also true that if the justices decided discrimination against gays violates the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection of the laws that same argument eventually could be used to invalidate the remaining state laws against same-sex marriage. The justices might be particularly willing to do so if the majority of states already had acted.AdvertisementIn 1967 the Supreme Court ruled that laws barring mixed-race couples from marriage violated the Constitution. By then only 16 states still had such laws on their books.david.savage@latimes.com,0
129,"GRAPEVINE Texas (AP) — In one of their most dramatic choices in a century local leaders of the Boy Scouts of America voted Thursday on whether to ease a divisive ban and allow openly gay boys to be accepted into the nation's leading youth organization.Whether yes or no the result will bitterly disappoint many. The decision expected Thursday evening could trigger defections among those on the losing side.Casting ballots were about 1400 voting members of BSA's National Council who were attending their annual meeting at a conference center not far from BSA headquarters in suburban Dallas.At stake was a proposal drafted by the BSA's governing executive committee that says boys could no longer be excluded from Scouting solely on the basis of sexual orientation. A longstanding ban on gay adult leaders would remain in place.Whatever the outcome the vote will not end the wrenching debate over the Scouts' membership policy.Some conservative churches that sponsor Scout units want to continue excluding gay youths and in some cases have threatened to leave the BSA if the ban were lifted.More liberal Scout leaders — while supporting the proposal to accept gay youth — have made clear they want the ban on gay adults lifted as well. If the full no-gays policy is maintained some units in liberal areas may consider either leaving the Scouts or openly defying the ban.However the vote goes the BSA could take a hit financially. Many Scout units in conservative areas fear their local donors will stop giving if the ban on gay youth is lifted while many major corporate donors are likely to withhold donations if the ban remains.In January the BSA executive committee suggested a plan to give sponsors of local Scout units the option of admitting gays as both youth members and adult leaders or continuing to exclude them. However the plan won little praise and the BSA changed course after assessing responses to surveys sent out starting in February to members of the Scouting community.Story continuesOf the more than 200000 leaders parents and youth members who responded 61 percent supported the current policy of excluding gays while 34 percent opposed it. However most parents of young Scouts as while as youth members themselves opposed the ban.In the weeks leading up to the vote and on Wednesday as National Council members arrived in Grapevine advocacy groups on both sides of the debate organized news conferences photo opportunities and forums to make their case.Two conservative groups opposed to any easing of the ban — the Family Research Council and OnMyHonor.net — placed an ad Thursday in the Dallas Morning News warning that lifting the ban on gay youth would trigger lawsuits that could force the BSA to admit gay adults as well as youth. It said lifting the ban on gay boys could drive out as many as 400000 of the Scouts' youth members.The BSA's overall ""traditional youth membership"" — Cub Scouts Boy Scouts and Venturers — is now about 2.6 million compared with more than 4 million in peak years of the past. It also has about 1 million adult leaders and volunteers.Of the more than 100000 Scouting units in the U.S. 70 percent are chartered by religious institutions. Those include liberal churches opposed to any ban on gays but some of the largest sponsors are relatively conservative denominations that have previously supported the broad ban — notably the Roman Catholic Church the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Southern Baptist churches.The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced in April that it was satisfied with new proposal and the National Catholic Committee on Scouting has not opposed it.However 50 leaders of other conservative religious groups have issued a statement imploring the National Council to retain the full ban warning that easing it ""would open the Scouts to a wide range of open sexual expressions.""The signatories included the leaders of the Assemblies of God the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary and the Southern Baptist Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission.The BSA which celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2010 has long excluded both gays and atheists.Protests over the no-gays policy gained momentum in 2000 when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the BSA's right to exclude gays. Scout units lost sponsorships by public schools and other entities that adhered to nondiscrimination policies and several local Scout councils made public their displeasure with the policy.___Crary reported from New York.___Online:BSA Membership Standards Resolution: http://bit.ly/185yyXk___Follow David Crary on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/craryapFollow Nomaan Merchant on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/nomaanmerchant",0

131,Before the Supreme Court justices turned to the merits of the case on Proposition 8 California’s ban on same-sex marriage they seemed perplexed by a procedural issue: whether the petitioners had legal standing to appeal a lower-court ruling that struck down the ballot measure. Having taken the appeal they cannot easily decide to avoid the substantive question of whether same-sex couples have a constitutionally protected right to marry in California and elsewhere in the country.If the court decides the case on the merits it is hard to imagine that a majority could be swayed by the arguments offered by Charles Cooper the lawyer for the marriage ban’s supporters. Even if his presentation had been more fluent there was no way to overcome the incoherence of his position.The core of Mr. Cooper’s argument was that a ruling allowing same-sex marriage would be “redefining” marriage in a way that undermines the “responsible procreation” of children. Yet California allows same-sex couples to adopt children and many heterosexual couples who can’t have children get married.When Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked him if — outside the marriage context — he could “think of any other rational basis reason for a state using sexual orientation as a factor in denying homosexuals benefits or imposing burdens” he could not. When Justice Elena Kagan asked him to describe “what harm to the institution of marriage or to opposite-sex couples” would occur if same-sex couples were allowed to marry he failed to provide a single example. He also contended that “debate over whether the age-old definition of marriage should be changed to include same-sex couples” should be left to the states but could not explain why the Constitution would permit this kind of discrimination.,0

133,"Richard Wolf and David Jackson USA TODAYPresident%27s %27evolution%27 on same-sex marriage is now completeJustice Department says gays%2C lesbians have equal right to wedCourt%27s historic debates scheduled for March 26-27WASHINGTON — The Obama administration came out forcefully Thursday against California's ban on same-sex marriage and by extension implicated similar bans in 37 other states.In a brief to the Supreme Court which will hear two landmark same-sex marriage cases in late March the Justice Department argued that gay and lesbian couples should have the same right to marry as heterosexuals.""The government seeks to vindicate the defining constitutional ideal of equal treatment under the law"" Attorney General Eric Holder said. ""Throughout history we have seen the unjust consequences of decisions and policies rooted in discrimination.""The brief marks the first time the administration has weighed in on the constitutionality of any state ban on gay marriage. Although it was aimed at the voter initiative passed in California in 2008 it put the administration squarely against other such prohibitions. It urged the court to subject the state's ban to a difficult legal standard that no state prohibition is likely to meet.In particular the brief implicated the other states that like California allow domestic partnerships or civil unions: Delaware Hawaii Illinois Nevada New Jersey Oregon and Rhode Island.""The designation of marriage ... confers a special validation of the relationship between two individuals and conveys a message to society that domestic partnerships or civil unions cannot match"" the brief states. ""Proposition 8's denial of marriage to same-sex couples particularly where California at the same time grants same-sex partners all the substantive rights of marriage violates equal protection.""Theodore Boutrous a partner in the law firm Gibson Dunn which is representing the two same-sex couples who filed the case initially said the administration's arguments represent ""a clear path to marriage equality across the United States.""The court filing completes President Obama's self-described evolution on gay marriage and puts his administration squarely on the side of gay rights groups and the nine states where same-sex marriage is legal.The president opposed California's ban Proposition 8 during his 2008 campaign but refused to endorse gay marriage. He made that endorsement during last year's campaign but said the issue should be decided by the states.Then in evocative language in this year's inaugural address Obama equated gay rights to past battles on behalf of women and African Americans by mentioning Stonewall the New York City bar that was the site of 1969's historic gay rights riots.""Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law"" Obama said. ""For if we are truly created equal then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.""The action was heralded by groups that seek to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide.""President Obama and the solicitor general have taken another historic step forward consistent with the great civil rights battles of our nation's history"" said Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin co-founder of the American Foundation for Equal Rights which brought the challenge to Proposition 8.Conservative groups criticized the decision to weigh in against the gay marriage ban particularly since Obama once said it should be left to the states. Tony Perkins president of the Family Research Council said the president was ""putting allegiance to extreme liberal social policies ahead of constitutional principle.""The high court has reserved two days in late March to consider the California ban on gay marriage and the Defense of Marriage Act which denies federal benefits to legally married same-sex couples. Both have been declared unconstitutional by lower courts decisions which are being challenged by gay-marriage opponents.Proposition 8 was approved by California voters in November 2008 to block a state Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage. Ever since gay couples have been blocked from marrying in the nation's most populous state. A final ruling overturning the ban would open the floodgates to thousands of new same-sex marriages there.What effect a court ruling striking down Proposition 8 would have on other states is not clear. The justices could rule narrowly as a federal appeals court did holding only that voters cannot take away a right previously enjoyed however briefly by Californians. But a more sweeping decision declaring marriage rights for gays and lesbians would endanger all state bans.The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) was passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton in 1996 as a response to a Hawaii Supreme Court ruling that questioned the denial of a marriage license to a same-sex couple. The federal law has blocked legally married couples from receiving federal benefits in Connecticut Iowa Maine Maryland Massachusetts New Hampshire New York Vermont Washington and the District of Columbia.The administration is leading the effort to overturn DOMA in the case of Edith Windsor an 83-year-old New York widow who was forced to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in estate taxes when her lesbian spouse died in 2009. Had she been married to a man she would have faced no inheritance tax.The new filing is more significant however because the administration did not have to get involved at all. Two same-sex couples are contesting Proposition 8 along with the state of California while organizations that promoted the 2008 voter initiative are defending it.In the Windsor case the Justice Department's brief argues that gays and lesbians have been subjected to a long history of discrimination and it refers specifically to the California marriage ban as an example.On the subject of states' rights vs. the Constitution its brief to the Supreme Court states: ""Deference to the democratic process must give way to the fundamental constitutional command of equal treatment under law.""Polls have been shifting toward approval of gay marriage. In a December USA TODAY survey 53% of Americans said same-sex couples deserve the same marriage rights as heterosexual couples up from 40% in 2009.California's ban has attracted 37 ""friend of the court"" briefs mostly from conservative and religious groups. Opponents of the ban have until today to file their briefs and until Friday in the Defense of Marriage Act case. They were coming in from a variety of groups on the political left and right:",0
134,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — For Mina Meyer and Sharon Raphael two women in their 70s who fell in love more than four decades ago and have been married for more than four years the U.S. Supreme Court's pending consideration of a law that prohibits the federal government from recognizing unions like theirs is about more than civil rights. It's about buying a new roof for their California home replacing their 2005 Toyota Camry and ensuring Meyer doesn't take a financial hit if Raphael dies first.The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments this month in a challenge to a provision of the Defense of Marriage Act or DOMA that denies legally married gay and lesbian couples federal benefits available to heterosexual married couples including tax and Social Security benefits. A decision is not expected until the end of June but accountants and tax attorneys anticipating the 18-year-old law's demise are already encouraging same-sex couples like Raphael and Meyer to seek prospective tax refunds back retirement payments and other spousal subsidies they may have been denied.It is unclear how the justices might rule but the Obama administration and former President Bill Clinton who signed the act into law have urged the court to overturn it on grounds that it violates the civil rights of gay Americans. DOMA supporters including House Republicans led by Speaker John Boehner argue that Congress — not the court — should decide as public opinion for same-sex marriage grows. Other conservative groups argue that spousal benefits should be reserved only for couples of the opposite sex.Part of the urgency for couples to act stems from deadlines established under the U.S. tax code which gives taxpayers three years to file protective claims for income and estate tax refunds. Same-sex couples or surviving spouses who were legally married before or during 2009 would therefore have until April 15 of this year to submit amended returns claiming overpayments on income for that tax year said Vickie Henry a senior staff attorney at Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders.Story continuesAt the time gay unions were legal in Massachusetts Connecticut Iowa and Vermont and briefly had been in California. New York and the District of Columbia which have since legalized same-sex unions also recognized marriages performed in other states or countries.While married couples from those jurisdictions would have the strongest cases couples from states such as Hawaii Nevada and Illinois that treat domestic partnerships and civil unions as the same as marriage for tax purposes might also see federal refunds depending on how the Supreme Court rules said Pat Cain a federal tax expert at the Santa Clara University School of Law.""On the income tax side anybody who would benefit from filing jointly and who would be eligible to do so if DOMA falls should consider filing amended tax returns for the applicable years"" Cain said.The sums at stake are not inconsequential. The case the justices accepted for example involves a New York state widow Edith Windsor 83 who is seeking a refund of the $363000 she had to pay in estate taxes after her wife Thea Spyer died in 2009. If Windsor had not been married to another woman her tax bill would have been $0 because married U.S. citizens are allowed to pass their assets onto their spouses tax-free — but only if the surviving spouse is of the opposite sex.Gerald McIntyre directing attorney at the National Senior Citizens Law Center said Social Security benefits which kick in based on the date of application are where gay couples have lost the most and stand the most to gain.Lower-earning spouses such as Meyer have been doubly penalized under DOMA McIntrye said first by being unable to claim the spousal benefit that allows married heterosexuals to increase their monthly benefits by drawing half of a husband or wife's Social Security then being deemed ineligible for survivor benefits that are equal to what a deceased spouse got in retirement each month.A 2009 study by The Williams Institute a think tank on sexual orientation and the law at the University of California Los Angeles estimated that gay couples received an average of $3060 less a year in Social Security benefits than married straight couples. For lesbian couples the disparity rose to $5412. The same study found that gay or lesbian widows or widowers lost out on more than $5700 a year in survivor benefits than their straight counterparts received.In the case of retirees Raphael and Meyer it could mean an additional $7335 year in Social Security benefits because Meyer who worked in office jobs and a bookstore would be entitled to the Social Security benefits of Raphael who earned considerably more as a college professor for 40 years. That would boost their fixed monthly income by about 10 percent. Last year on the advice of a professional colleague and with the high court poised to decide if DOMA is constitutional Meyer applied for more than a year's worth of retroactive benefits as well as bigger future checks if the law is struck down.""This is not the only money we live on but it does make a big difference"" said Meyer 73 who also would see her Social Security checks more than quadruple in the event she is widowed and the court overturns the act. ""That $700 a month is $700 a month.""Other married same-sex couples may end up paying more in taxes if DOMA is overturned due to the so-called federal ""marriage penalty."" Janis Cowhey McDonagh a tax attorney in the New York office of accounting firm Marcum LLP (equals) has been encouraging many of her clients in same-sex marriages to get their returns in order before the Supreme Court rules.""If it's better for them to file single even though they are married I tell them they need to file before DOMA comes down because if DOMA comes down they won't have the choice"" she said.___Follow Lisa Leff on Twitter at: https://twitter.com/scoopscout",0
135,The approximately 500 “Justice For Trayvon” protesters in Washington D.C. on Saturday heard calls from progressive speakers for specific boycott actions they want to use force Florida and other states to eliminate “Stand Your Ground” laws.Even though such self-defense laws were not used in George Zimmerman’s defense comedian and veteran progressive activist Dick Gregory argued at the rally outside the federal courthouse in Washington on Constitution Avenue that people should fight against them. Gregory also praised protesters who staged a sit-in until they could meet with Florida Gov. Rick Scott who has agreed to meet with the protesters but continues standing strong on Florida’s Stand Your Ground law. Gregory called for protesters to join musician Stevie Wonder in boycotting Florida.We say thanks to brother Stevie Wonder. For all of his gigs he pays $100000 tax. So you see what he’s giving up. We sit around arguing about so and so is not doing this reverend is not doing this I don’t hear you talking about Stevie. He didn’t have to huddle with nobody. He didn’t have to go to New York and huddle with white agents and say “Can I do this?” So what can we do to help Stevie? We don’t have to ask the First National Bank. We don’t have to ask Congress. We can make our decision when we leave here today because that governor of Florida said last night “Hear me hear me!” He said “I’ll meet with them but nothing is going to change.” And he met with them and he said if the deal was passed again he would sign it. Well we got a message for you.Some members of the crowd jumped in and started shouting “Boycott Florida! Boycott Florida!”Gregory made the argument that supporters of Trayvon Martin should take action by not acting. “Whoa. Hang on” he said. “Let me say something. Let me say something. See that’s what you mean. Some of y’all ain’t been to Florida in your life and ain’t going. And all you got to do is get Florida to come to you. Now what do I mean by that? They got oranges that they can’t afford to have you not buy because they will rot.”“You leave here now and you get on the phone and you call people and tell them to call people” he continued. “I said to my grandmother ‘We not going to boycott Florida orange juice because Florida orange juice is sold under different names. We going to boycott orange juice.’ And when them orange growers start running in to take that governor and he knows he can’t stand his ground with them. This is who we are. Starting thinking about Christmas. You know it’s hard to get us to do something.”Gregory called for people to boycott Disney as well since it is based in Orlando Fla. “How many of y’all have been to Disneyland to see a rat?” Gregory said referencing Mickey Mouse to laughter from the several hundred in attendance. “But haven’t walked down the street to see King’s tomb? Had he not died you wouldn’t be welcome in Orlando. So we not asking you to do anything that costs you. We just say save your money. Don’t spend it. And when they understand who you are then things will stop happening.” Disneyland is located in Anaheim CA. Disneyworld is located in Orlando FL.Gregory was not the only speaker at the rally; E. Faye Williams the chair of the National Congress of Black Women opened her remarks to the crowd by saying “We stand with our queen sister Sybrina Fulton.”Williams then began advocating the crowd to take action through various tactics against those who support Stand Your Ground laws. “So we say to you my brothers and sisters don’t feel like somebody else has to do it” she said. “Everybody can do something.”“If you haven’t registered to vote yet you can register to vote” she said. “If you haven’t helped somebody else register to vote you can help them register to vote. If you haven’t given a dime to the Trayvon Martin foundation so we can carry on this work give a dime give your time or give something.”Williams said Stand Your Ground laws “are disproportionately unfair to young black men.”“We have to be there [where states are implementing these laws]” she said. “We have to keep on pulling our money back. I did it. When I heard about Stand Your Ground and how the American Legislative Exchange Council is going around the country getting states to enact Stand Your Ground laws. I pulled my money out of Bank of America. I pulled my money out of State Farm insurance.”,0

137,George Zimmerman was back in court today for a hearing on the start date for his trial on murder charges. Zimmerman of course was the Hispanic neighborhood watchman in Sanford Florida who trailed a young black man named Trayvon Martin after calling 911 got into an altercation with Martin in which Martin ended up pounding Zimmerman’s head into the pavement and then ended up shooting Martin in the chest. The media used the Zimmerman case as an opportunity to bully Americans over their supposed racial intolerance. Even the President of the United States weighed in in the midst of an election cycle suggesting that if he had a son he’d look like Trayvon Martin.Breitbart News had the opportunity to sit down for a one-on-one interview with George’s brother Robert in Los Angeles. Excerpts of that interview played tonight on Fox News’ Hannity.Robert didn’t pull any punches about President Obama’s role in raising the threat level to his brother – and to his family. “We do feel that we’re threatened” Robert told Breitbart News. “There’s not been a legal resolution in this matter. And even the day that there is legal resolution in this matter the day that happens I don’t think that every single fear of some kind of retribution will simply just go way but we’re coping as bets we can day by day.”Robert saved especially harsh criticism for President Obama who inserted himself in the Zimmerman case even inviting race-baiter Al Sharpton to the White House shortly after Sharpton threatened the town of Sanford over the Police Department’s decision not to arrest Zimmerman originally. When the President was asked about the Zimmerman case in the Rose Garden Robert said “Here was this president from the backdrop of the Rose Garden making comments about someone based on his skin color. I think we felt bullied we were a little let down initially and that disappointment grew because if you don’t have the support of at least the law on your side of the most powerful man in the Western Hemisphere reminding the world that it is entitled to watch reminding Americans that the world is watching and that we will get through this with due process but instead bringing up statements about his skin color … it was alarming to say the least.”Robert went further: “I don’t think a white president would have been able to get away with the same thing from the Rose Garden in an election season.”The fallout to the Zimmerman family has been extreme. According to Robert they often require security for everyday tasks. They have had to move around to avoid targeting. And now George faces a trial in a case where many legal observers agree there is no evidence to support the prosecutor’s second degree murder charge. No matter what happens George Zimmerman will thanks to the President and the media remain a racist in many Americans’ minds. “If you can’t rebut assertions of racism” said Robert “the noise kind of drowns you out. You’re really left defenseless and you have no other choice but to go into hiding.”Ben Shapiro is Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News and author of the book “Bullies: How the Left’s Culture of Fear and Intimidation Silences America” (Threshold Editions January 8 2013).,1
138,"Fox News reporters Greg Jarrett and Ed Henry speak truth* to power: by three African American teenagersThe issue exposed by Jarrett and Henry? The fact that President Obama has not made any public statements on the murder of college baseball player Christopher Lane who was white. (See my update below: The teenagers who murdered Lane weren't all African American.)Why do they think this is notable? Because Obama did offer public comments after Trayvon Martin was killed and after (in Jarrett's words) ""the black Harvard professor"" got arrested inside his home (Jarrett might not know it but that professor—Henry Louis Gates—has a name).In the Jarrett-Henry world this is is hypocrisy and it proves that President Obama is a virulent anti-white racist who secretly supports the random murder of white people—as long as the murders are committed by non-whites. Never mind the fact that Obama's mother was white or that his comments on Gates and Jarrett came in response to questions from reporters. Clearly Paul LePage was right: Obama hates white people.Of course Gates and Jarrett completely ignore the fact that when Trayvon Martin was killed George Zimmerman—the admitted killer—wasn't arrested until weeks after the murder. Lane's murderers were arrested within 24 hours. That's exactly as should be. His murder was awful and nothing can change that. But the justice system is working. Without the outrage following Martin's murder Zimmerman never would have had to defend himself in a court of law.Jarrett and Henry aren't alone; Fox has spent much of they day posing various forms of the ""where's the outrage question"" and much of the rest of the conservative media is joining in as well. But these guys don't care about Christopher Lane or really even about what President Obama did or didn't say. As James David Dickson writes in the Detroit News:The “where’s the outrage?” argument comes in another form: Why don’t black people protest black-on-black violence? What about all those dead kids in Chicago and Detroit? Where’s the march for them? This is an argument steeped in ignorance. If the people who make it spent even a minute researching they’d see their premise was faulty. The reason they don’t know that people do care and do march to stop black-on-black violence is because they don’t care about black-on-black violence. They’re trying to use dead black kids in Chicago to stop you from caring about a dead black kid in Florida when in reality they care about neither.That's exactly right. Ultimately this outrage is manufactured to make the Fox audience feel good about themselves when they turn their heads to injustice. It's about making sure they don't forget that they are the real victims here because who knows what terrible things might happen to the Republican Party if one day Fox viewers woke up and lost that chip on their shoulder.*Well not so much truth as stupid and dishonest race-baiting propaganda.Wow it turns out that Fox was even worse than I thought—and that I stupidly fell for part of it. It turns out that the one of the three individuals who murdered Lane was white. So (a) my initial post got that fact wrong for which I apologize and (b) Fox is even loopier than I originally stated.Sign our petition demanding that Fox News correct their factual mistake and cease the despicable race-baiting that has resulted.",0
139,Moments after President Obama made his briefing room statement about race and Trayvon Martin CNN’s BREAKING NEWS graphic swirled faded and cut to anchor Brooke Baldwin who was visibly flushed with excitement. Brooke announced “Wow what a surprise we have all witnessed if you have been tuned in the last half-hour we were watching THE President surprise everyone…”She went on to describe Obama’s statement as “very very personal; very heartfelt.” Baldwin then assured her audience that Obama had “not used a teleprompter” because he had “given much thought and much time to making this message VERY personal.”The CNN anchor then went to a video clip saying “But FIRST here’s the president making this personal.”Apparently Baldwin thought Obama’s statement was personal.After the clip Breathless Brooke returned with her panel: Candy Crowley Sonny Hostin Jessica Yellin and Gloria Borger.After another “Wow!” Baldwin (who looked like she might have been trembling) turned things over to Chief White House Correspondent Yellin.If you hadn’t known what she was talking about based solely on Yellin’s awe-inspired melodramatic rhetoric you would think that something had happened on the level of the first man walking on the moon. Barely able to contain herself Yellin described Obama’s statement as something “as personal and as bluntly as I have ever heard him speak about racism in America and his own experience of racism in his life.”Yellin later added that this was “an important moment for this president and an important moment for America.”After again reminding us of how “incredibly personal” Obama was Baldwin then turned things over to Candy Crowley.As excited as the rest Crowley jumped right in to tell us that Obama is a “thoughtful guy” and the “sort of person who thinks these things through.”Crowley obviously missed Obama’s “acted stupid” racial debacle.Crowley closed her comment by pointing out that Obama has just “elevated the discussion.”Sonny Hostin the only legal analyst in the country who was shocked by the Zimmerman verdict was left a little speechless due to the “so many thoughts she had running through her mind. After mentioning that she was the mother of a “young brown boy” she then put those thoughts together and used Obama’s words to trash our country and judicial system as racist.Finally it was political analyst Gloria Borger’s turn and she started out with some hysterical nonsense about how Obama didn’t want this conversation to be about him — even though this is the second time he has chosen to interject both himself and his race into a local crime that had nothing to with him or racism. Borger found this “stunning.”Borger than narrowed her eyes and talked about how Obama came to the podium as an “African-American male and reflected soberly about some important issues we have to discuss in this country.” Borger was in awe over how Obama “distilled ” all of these complicated issues one statement.My favorite part of the discussion though was Borger’s non sequitar. Baldwin had a good moment when she said that she wanted to make clear that the “Stand your Ground” law had nothing to do with Zimmerman’s defense.Borger then jumped in to say “But it is the law in thirty states.”Huh?Bottom line: For almost fifteen minutes it was hard to tell if you were watching a cable news network or a slumber party-cam with five breathless Beliebers after a Justin Bieber concert.The gushing was as non-stop as the criticism and intelligent insight was non-existent.Throughout the segment Obama was constantly referred to as an “African-American.”Like George Zimmerman Obama has one white parent.CNN however only refers to Zimmerman as a “white Hispanic.”UPDATE: 90 minutes later CNN is still at it.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC,1
140,"8 years ago(CNN) - Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Tuesday her prayers are with Trayvon Martin's family and ""every family who loves someone who is lost to violence.""Addressing the Delta Sigma Theta sorority convention in Washington Clinton told the crowd ""No mother no father should ever have to fear for their child walking down a street in the United States of America.""Clinton who's widely considered a potential 2016 presidential contender addressed the largely-African American audience just days after a Florida jury acquitted George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Martin 17.The jury's decision sparked protests across the country while many groups including the NAACP ramped up pressure on the Justice Department to press federal civil rights charges against Zimmerman.At the top of her speech Tuesday Clinton briefly addressed Martin's death and the recent trial - a story that has loomed large over the convention.""In a week that I know has brought heartache - deep painful heartache to many across our country - the solidarity and the solace you find here is all the more important"" she said.Attorney General Eric Holder addressed the same convention on Monday calling Martin's death a ""tragic unnecessary shooting"" and vowing that the Justice Department with ""follow the facts of the law"" as it continues to investigate the incident.For her part Clinton encouraged the sorority the nation's single largest African-American women's organization to ""move forward.""""As we move forward as we must I hope this sisterhood will continue to be a force for justice and understanding"" she said.Tuesday's appearance marked the latest in Clinton's busy speech circuit. Since retiring as secretary of state at the beginning of 2013 the former first lady and U.S. senator from New York has made numerous paid and non-paid speeches across the country fueling further speculation that she's gearing up for a presidential bid.She also addressed the Supreme Court's recent decision that effectively ruled key parts of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 as invalid. The high court left it up to a divided Congress to revise the law so that it's constitutional in the minds of a majority of justices.While many Republicans praised the decision - saying it allowed some states to navigate more freely around outdated rules - many Democrats and civil rights leaders argue the ruling threatens voting rights for minorities in states with a history of discrimination.Clinton urged the sorority women to pressure Congress to rewrite the law so that those key parts are deemed constitutional.""I want to make sure that in the next election and the next election and the next and every one after that people line up to vote and they vote regardless of those who may not want to count their vote or acknowledge their right to vote"" she said drawing heavy applause.- CNN's Ashley Killough and Steve Brusk contributed to this report.",0

View photos of key moments from the trial.Story highlights Andrew McCarthy: Justice Department should handle cases based strictly on facts and law McCarthy: Attorney General Eric Holder should not have politicized the Zimmerman case He says Zimmerman case is not a federal case because civil rights was not an issue McCarthy: If justice had been served Zimmerman case would never have been a criminal case(CNN) —We have a Department of Justice not a Department of Social Justice. That is an essential distinction. It is brought into sharp relief by politicized demands that George Zimmerman having just been acquitted of murder by the state of Florida be subjected to a second prosecution – a federal civil rights indictment – over the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.The Justice Department has earned the trust of the United States courts precisely because it resists the politicization of law enforcement. Its tradition is to ensure the equal protection of law for every American to evaluate cases strictly on the basis of facts and law and to recognize its obligations not only to the community but also to criminal suspects.Yet though Attorney General Eric Holder never tires of reminding us about the due process owed even to foreign terrorists who’ve confessed to mass murder the principle does not seem to apply to Zimmerman an American now acquitted of murder.Even if the Justice Department never files criminal charges against Zimmerman – which is likely given the implausibility of obtaining a conviction – it is extremely inappropriate for law enforcement officials particularly the U.S. attorney general to engage in a running extrajudicial commentary that taints the jury pool and ratchets up the investigative anxiety for a citizen who is presumed innocent and has been acquitted. Law enforcement officials speak in court – with public charges if prosecutors have the evidence to back them up.Andrew C. McCarthyThe justice system is not a morality play. It is not designed to right every wrong nor has it the capacity to remediate tragedy such as the indescribable pain the Martin family endures after the loss of their 17-year-old son. In the face of such tragedy the human instinct to demand some kind of “justice” – social poetic or cosmic – is something we all feel. But that is not the justice our legal system exists to dispense.Federal courts prosaically apply established law to provable facts and they rely heavily on the Justice Department to perform that duty faithfully. When a popular political narrative – such as the left’s portrayal of racism as the root cause of many American ills – crashes into uncongenial facts the justice system is the place where the narrative must yield and the Justice Department is supposed to ensure that it does.Sadly just the opposite has happened in the Zimmerman case. It has been bereft from the start both of proof that Zimmerman had the requisite criminal intent to sustain a murder charge and of evidence to refute his well-corroborated claim of self-defense. That is why veteran police investigators initially declined to file charges.Yet Holder and his subordinates joined in the effort to induce Florida to file charges unabashedly making common cause with the likes of the Rev. Al Sharpton whose metier is racially divisive demagoguery.Attending an anti-Zimmerman rally with Sharpton Holder saber-rattled about filing a civil rights case. As the attorney general well knew his inappropriate chatter would be construed as a suggestion that Florida had abdicated its responsibilities by declining to prosecute a purportedly racist murderer. Simultaneously Justice’s Community Relations Service worked closely with anti-Zimmerman activists to pressure Florida Gov. Rick Scott into reversing the police determination that there was no case. Scott finally caved appointing the compliant special prosecutor Angela Corey who dutifully lodged a groundless second-degree murder charge.Standard prudent Justice Department practice has always discouraged commentary on criminal investigations outside the public record. That is for the politicians. Law enforcement is not supposed to speak until the government is ready to file public charges and back them up in court.To the contrary Holder has engaged in an extrajudicial publicity campaign and now finds himself in the hot seat: It’s been over a year since he promised to file charges if warranted by the facts and the facts have long been known – indeed they’ve been tried in court.Obviously it is easier to promise to keep investigating – and to keep alive a race narrative dear to President Obama’s political base – than to acknowledge that there is no federal case against Zimmerman. The insurmountable proof problems Florida prosecutors faced do not even begin to describe the challenges that would confront a federal case.A civil rights case would require proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Zimmerman shot Martin out of racial animus. There is no evidence that Zimmerman has ever been a racist – jurors in the Florida case say race was not relevant to the case and the FBI after investigating extensively for months has been unable to find proof of a racial motivation.Furthermore a federal prosecution would require proof that Zimmerman was trying to prevent Martin’s enjoyment of some statutorily specified civil right – like attending school applying for a job staying in a hotel going to a restaurant or participating in a federal program. The Zimmerman-Martin altercation was purely local with no federal implications.Finally in light of the Justice Department’s heavy-handed role in pressuring Florida to bring a case that police originally decided not to charge there may be a serious question whether the “dual sovereignty” exception to double jeopardy – allowing a federal prosecution despite a state acquittal – applies.This is not a federal case. If real justice had been served it would never have been a criminal case at all.Follow @CNNOpinion on Twitter.Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion.The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrew C.

142,How big of a wake-up call are the Obama scandals especially the ones surrounding the seizing of phone records from the Associated Press and the IRS’s targeting of conservatives? So big that two of the media’s most shameful and shameless gun control advocates — Joe Scarborough and Piers Morgan — have finally conceded that arguments made by pro-Second Amendment activists against the expanding of background checks might not be so ridiculous.In a roundtable discussion on Friday’s “Morning Joe” Scarborough said that because of the IRS scandal “My argument is less persuasive today because of these scandals.” He added: “People say ‘Hey if they do this with the IRS asking people what books you read then how can I trust them with information about my Second Amendment rights?'”Mika agreed completely: “That is a really really good point.” Even the Huffington Post’s Sam Stein agreed.Andrew Johnson at NRO grabbed the video:——Scarborough added that when it comes to both background checks and immigration reform the IRS scandal is “devastating” because both of those pieces of legislation ask us to trust the kind of government that would seize the media’s phone records and use the IRS to target a president’s political foes.Also courtesy of NRO here is no-less than Piers Morgan conceding he was wrong to ridicule gun-rights activists (including our own Ben Shapiro) for making the argument that a legitimate fear of government tyranny is what makes the Second Amendment so crucial:——Though I was appalled by the media’s relentless and shameless push last month to pass the Toomey-Manchin bill that would have tightened background checks I did support its passage and said so many times while criticizing the media for their disgusting behavior. But this chilling reminder of how corrupt the federal government is has changed my mind completely.Moreover our government is not only corrupt it is vigorously protected by a media that is just as corrupt (NEVER forget the media ignored dismissed and even defended the IRS targeting conservatives).

145,Recently uncovered government documents reveal that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) unmanned Predator B drone fleet has been custom designed to identify civilians carrying guns and track cell phone signals.“I am very concerned that this technology will be used against law-abiding American firearms owners” said founder and executive vice president of the Second Amendment Foundation Alan Gottlieb. “This could violate Fourth Amendment rights as well as Second Amendment rights.”The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) obtained a partially redacted copy of Homeland Security’s drone requirements through a Freedom of Information Act request; CNET uncovered an unredacted copy.Homeland Security design requirements specify that its Predator B drones “shall be capable of identifying a standing human being at night as likely armed or not” and must be equipped with “interception” systems capable of reading cell phone signals.The first known domestic use of a drone to arrest a U.S. citizen occurred last year in the small town of Lakota North Dakota when rancher Rodney Brossart was arrested for refusing to return six of his neighbor’s cows that had wandered on to his property. Critics say the fact that domestic drones are being used in such minor matters raises serious concerns about civil liberties and government overreach.“That drone is not just picking up information on what’s happening at that specific scene it’s picking up everything else that’s going on” says drone expert and Brookings Institution senior fellow Peter Singer. “Basically it’s recording footage from a lot of different people that it didn’t have their approval to record footage.”Others like progressive author Naomi Wolf have warned that domestic drones may soon be weaponized. The military version of the Predator B drone carries 100-pound Hellfire missiles but the Homeland Security’s Customs and Border Protection (CBP) says the 10 drones in its domestic fleet are unarmed.Last month NBC News uncovered a confidential 16-page Justice Department memo that concluded the U.S. government may execute a drone strike on an American citizen it believes to be a “senior operational leader” of al-Qaeda or “an associated force.”The Obama Administration defended the use of drones to kill Americans thought to be working with terrorists. “These strikes are legal they are ethical and they are wise” said White House press secretary Jay Carney.,1

148,SACRAMENTO — Enforce the laws already on the books. Take away the criminals’ weapons not the law-abiding citizens’. Sound familiar? It’s the mantra of the gun lobby.That is until the government actually attempts to do it. Then the lobby changes its lyrics.AdvertisementIt seemed surreal listening to lobbyists for gun rights groups Monday as if the ears were playing tricks. They testified at a state Senate Budget Committee hearing in opposition to legislation that would spend $24 million in surplus money to confiscate guns possessed by people who legally aren’t supposed to have them.They weren’t opposed to the gun seizure they said—only to the use of this particular money. It would come from the $19 fee each gun buyer pays for a background check to determine whether he’s legally eligible to possess a weapon. Is he a felon? Mentally ill?AdvertisementThe lobbyists contended the fee is too high and should be lowered. Never mind that the gun buyer already probably is spending several hundred dollars to buy the weapon. And bullets—depending on the caliber—may go for around say $1 each.They also argued the money should be used to speed up the background check and reduce the 10-day waiting period for taking possession of a gun. In other words it’s more important to rush a weapon into the hands of a purchaser than to grab one from the clutches of a violent criminal.Advertisement“They’re trapped and lost in their own world and it’s not the real world” says Sen. Mark Leno (D-San Francisco) coauthor of the bill SB 140 and chairman of the budget committee.Let’s back up.AdvertisementCalifornia has a unique program—the only one in the nation—that tracks known handgun and assault weapons owners to make sure they’re still legally permitted to possess a firearm. Starting next year they’ll also be doing it with buyers of all long guns.Although the gun owner originally was a legal purchaser he may have since been convicted of a violent misdemeanor or been subject to a restraining order or been diagnosed with a mental illness. A little computer cross-checking produces a red flag. And a squad of armed officers can knock on the door and seize the arsenal. Roughly 11000 weapons have been grabbed over the past six years.AdvertisementBut a few weeks ago it was revealed by the state Department of Justice that roughly 19700 Californians still illegally owned around 39000 firearms and there wasn’t enough money to confiscate them.So Leno and Senate leader Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento) introduced the bill appropriating the money on an urgency basis which means it will require a two-thirds majority vote in each house.AdvertisementAt the committee hearing the Justice Department reported that the list of “prohibited” gun owners as of March 1 had risen to an even 20000 people possessing 40790 firearms.“We know 40000 guns are in the hands of people who shouldn’t have them” Steinberg told the committee. “We know their addresses we know who they are….Advertisement“We’re not unmindful that money is precious. But here is $24 million. Go get those guns as fast as you can….This is about the notion that you do whatever you can with what you have.”A no-brainer you’d think. But not for the gun lobby.AdvertisementAlthough the number of prohibited persons possessing weapons is “inexcusable” said Kathryn Lynch representing the National Shooting Sports Foundation and the California Assn. of Firearms Retailers it is “inappropriate” to use background-check money to seize the guns.“I would argue” she continued “that this is tantamount to an attack on honest citizens.”AdvertisementNational Rifle Assn. lobbyist Ed Worley contended that the $19 fee is too high.Tom Pedersen of the California Rifle and Pistol Assn. said the surplus money should be spent on upgrading the system to accelerate the checks.AdvertisementSam Peredes lobbyist for Gun Owners of California said that using money from “law abiding gun purchasers” to seize the guns of bad guys “is not fair and reasonable and we believe places an undue burden on those people who are exercising their 2nd Amendment rights.”He contended the weapons confiscation should be paid for out of the state’s general fund.AdvertisementGuess that also means hunting-license revenue shouldn’t be used to hire game wardens to track down poachers who despoil everyone’s wildlife.Peredes lamented that the committee had blown a “historic opportunity to have both the anti-gun and the pro-gun side come together.”AdvertisementAnd in that sentence he verbalized the gun lobby’s isolation from mainstream America. It’s blinded by an uncompromising view that either people are “anti-gun” or “pro-gun” denying the reality that someone can support gun ownership while still seeking common-sense solutions to gun violence.A Field Poll recently found that 61% of California voters believe it’s more important to impose stiffer gun controls than to protect gun rights.AdvertisementThe committee ignored the gun lobby and voted for the bill 14-0 — with both Republicans and Democrats on board. Leno says he’ll take it up soon on the Senate floor.A Republican co-author Sen. Anthony Cannella of Ceres told me “It’s a great bill. It seems a great use of the fees. It just makes common sense.”AdvertisementAs for the gun lobby opposition Cannella said: “I don’t understand it. They always say ‘Take guns out of the hands of the people who shouldn’t have them.’ ”No longer. They’ve reloaded with a new refrain.Advertisementgeorge.skelton@latimes.com,0
149,"A New York state judge agreed Friday to consider whether the state's tough new gun restrictions were rushed into law in violation of the state constitution.State Supreme Court Justice Gerald Connolly signed an order granting the request for a hearing by plaintiffs who are challenging Gov. Andrew Cuomo's decision to waive the three-day review usually required before votes on bills according to LoHud.com.The plaintiffs argue the law violates the guarantees of free speech property ownership and the right to petition the government guaranteed under the state and federal constitutions.Plaintiff Robert Schulz called Cuomo a ""king"" for pushing through the nation's toughest gun law by suspending the three-day vetting period by submitting a “message of necessity” on the law which allows the constitutional waiting period to be suspended.""Kings govern by opinion"" said Shulz who calls himself a ""constitutionalist"" and has challenged governors for decades in court although he isn't a lawyer. ""There has to be some rationale some justification of facts before waiving the people's demand for three days""' review of a bill.The law enacted Jan. 15 pushed by Cuomo sets a seven-bullet limit on magazines tightens the definition of illegal ""assault weapons"" and requires owners of formerly legal semi-automatic guns to register them among other measures.The New Yorkers are representing themselves without lawyers. A March 11 date in state court is scheduled. State officials will have to argue their case to avoid an injunction against the law.""We believe the law is and the process was valid and constitutional"" said Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi.Cuomo and legislative leaders agreed on the bill in closed-door negotiations and put the politically dicey measure to a vote at night in mid-January. That was after Cuomo issued the message of necessity which the plaintiffs say includes misrepresentations.The message of necessity according to LoHud.com reads: “Some weapons are so dangerous and some ammunition devices are so lethal that New York State must act without delay to prohibit their continued sale and possession in the state in order to protect its children first responders and citizens as soon as possible. This bill if enacted would do so by immediately banning the ownership purchase and sale of assault weapons and large capacity ammunition feeding devices.”Schulz of Warren County called the gun control law ""repugnant"" and seeks to have it declared void. The plaintiffs said they have 1200 backers.Click here for more from LoHud.com.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",1
150,The newest Obama scandal is seventeen months old.Welcome to Trayvongate where the President of the United States used both the bully pulpit the Department of Justice and sly media manipulation to gin up charges of racism in the George Zimmerman/Trayvon Martin shooting. Now that the trial is almost finished and the only act of racism mentioned so far came from the victim–Martin called Zimmerman ‘a creepy ass cracker’ according to testimony–the cynical and repeated use of the race card by the White house is even more abhorrent.Judicial Watch revealed documents today that proved what Breitbart News reported in April 2012: that Eric Holder’s Department of Justice took an active role in racially charged rallies in Sanford Florida and that the Community Relations Service helped force the temporary resignation of Sheriff Bill Lee. That resignation made it appear that Sanford authorities were suspect and possibly complicit in covering up something.Some of my reporting at the time was based on interviews with numerous public officials in Sanford who wanted to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution from the Obama administration. They described a situation where the CRS team took over and forced decisions while clearing a path for protests and rallies that heightened the appearence of racial tensions.The CRS is a small unit within the Department of Justice and ostensibly it serves a legitimate purpose; attempting to cool down tense situation. As its website says:The Community Relations Service is the Department’s “peacemaker” for community conflicts and tensions arising from differences of race color and national origin. Created by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 CRS is the only Federal agency dedicated to assist State and local units of government private and public organizations and community groups with preventing and resolving racial and ethnic tensions incidents and civil disorders and in restoring racial stability and harmony.However under the highly politicized Holder Department of Justice the CRS has acted as ‘spies and muscle’ according to a source familiar with the unit. In the Zimmerman case they ended up as doing nothing to facilitate ‘racial stability and harmony ‘ instead acting a heavy thumb on the scales of justice and helping to force events that gave the nation an impression that Martin’s death was racially motivated.Not just George Zimmerman but the police and the entire town were targeted in rallies that saw people being bused-in for protests. We now have proof via the Judicial Watch release that these rallies were facilitated by the Obama administration. They were also highly racially charged. Close Obama ally Al Sharpton along with Jesse Jackson led the charge. As CBS Miami reported:“We live in the middle of an American paradox” Rev. Sharpton told the crowd. “We can put a black man in the White House but we cannot walk a black child through a gated neighborhood. We are not selling out bowing out or backing down until there is justice for Trayvon.” “This is not about a hoodie it’s about racial profiling” Jackson said. “We will use our marching feet civil disobedience and every weapon in our non-violent arsenal until justice is served.”However much of the rhetoric surrounding the Zimmerman story was violent. Many will remember that the New Black Panther party actually offered a $10000 bounty for the ‘capture’ of George Zimmerman. As the Orlando Sentinal reported:New Black Panther leader Mikhail Muhammad announced the reward during a protest in Sanford Saturday. And when asked whether he was inciting violence Muhammad replied defiantly: “An eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth.” The bounty announcement came moments after members of the group called for the mobilization of 10000 black men to capture Zimmerman who shot Trayvon in a gated Sanford community on Feb. 26. Muhammad said members of his group would search for Zimmerman themselves in Maitland — where the 28-year old worked before the shooting employees there told the Orlando Sentinel. He declined to say when the group would begin their search.J. Christian Adams knows the New Black Panther Party well; he resigned his position at the DOJ over the refusal to prosecute the Panthers for the now infamous Philadephia voter intimidation actions during the 2008 election. Adams outlined the crimes committed by the NBPP in Sanford:Let’s start with solicitation to kidnap. In announcing a reward for the seizure of Zimmerman the New Black Panthers may have violated Florida Code 787.01. It makes it a felony to “by threat confining or abducting or imprisoning another person against his . . . will without lawful authority with intent to . . . terrorize.” Merely soliciting someone else to do this is also a felony in Florida under Florida Code 777.04. “A person who solicits another to commit an offense prohibited by law and in the course of such solicitation commands encourages hires or requests another person to engage in specific conduct which would constitute such offense or an attempt to commit such offense commits the offense of criminal solicitation.”That’s only part of the list. The New Black Panther’s outrageous illegal call for vigilante justice happened on March 24th. According the records obtained by Judicial Watch the Department of Justice deployed to Sanford the next day: March 25th 2012. However the DOJ did not go to Sanford to make arrests against the New Black Panthers. Instead according the the written record obtained by Judicial Watch they “deployed to Sanford FL to work marches demonstrations and rallies related to the shooting and death of an African-American teen by a neighborhood watch captain.”Once again the Holder Department of Justice failed to prosecute the New Black Panther Party. They actually helped facilitate mass rallies against Zimmerman and the City of Sanford.These actions are made even more scandalous by the direct insertion of the President of the United States into the story. President Obama made his famous “If I had a son he’d look like Trayvon” remark at the White House but what got considerably less press was the fact that Obama had a prior relationship with Martin’s attorney Benjamin Crump. Obama worked with him on another racially charged case when he was a Senator.Breitbart News reported on the Obama connection to the 2006 story of Martin Lee Anderson. Attorney Crump said publicly that he was following the same media ‘playbook’ as the Anderson case. Tactics included using a photo of Anderson as a child the same way the media used the Crump-supplied photo of Trayvon Martin as child. This story from 2006 shows the involvement of Senator Obama (who did not end up appearing at the rally) Sharpton and Jackson as well as other usual suspects from the far left.A rally will be taking place in Tallahassee Friday April 21 regarding the ongoing investigation into the death of 14-year-old Martin Lee Anderson. Anderson died Jan. 6 at a Panhandle boot camp after being kneed and punched by Bay County Sheriff’s boot camp guards. Students from Florida State University Tallahassee Community College and Florida A&M University have been involved in the planning and organization of the event at which Rev. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton will be making appearances. Charlie and Martin Sheen who donated $10000 to the cause are also reportedly planning to attend Friday along with former TLC member Tionne “T-Boz” Watkins and Afeni Shakur mother of the murdered rapper Tupac Shakur. According Samantha Greer an FSU student and volunteer for the Coalition for Justice for Martin Lee Anderson Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois may also make an appearance. Greer stressed that the Coalition is still looking for volunteers and that anyone is welcome to join the cause.What we saw in 2012 was the Obama administration using taxpayer resources to ratchet up racial tensions in a local crime case and literally creating key story points in the narrative such as forcing the sheriff to temporarily resign. At the same time the President himself made an emotional statement about the victim with direct reference to his race without revealing that he had worked with the victim’s attorney a few years earlier in a similar case. At the same time Obama media ally (and Sharpton employer) NBC outrageously edited the Zimmerman audio to make Zimmerman appear racist. All these manipulative and deceptive uses of the race card–pushed along by the Holder DOJ at taxpayer expense–happened just months before the 2012 presidential election.The only reason this isn’t a major scandal already is the media hasn’t ever done its job and declared it one.,1
151,Larimer County Colorado Sheriff Justin Smith is one of nearly 30 Sheriffs who have signed their names on the dotted line of a lawsuit to overturn the latest slew of gun control laws passed by the Colorado legislature and signed by Governor John Hickenlooper (D).The suit in which Smith is taking part specifically targets the laws that emerged from HB 1224 and HB 1229.HB 1224 bans rifle and pistol magazines holding more than 15 rounds that “were acquired after July 1 2013.” At the same time it also bans many other magazines by prohibiting smaller magazines “designed to be readily converted.”When Breitbart News spoke to Sheriff Smith on July 22 he explained:The problem with this is that those who wrote the law don’t understand firearms or magazines. And many of the most popular firearms have magazines with removal floorplates — for instance a Glock magazine. This law will effectively ban certain magazines even if they’re under the capacity limit based solely on the fact that they are expandable or simply give the appearance of expandability.HB 1229 put background checks in place for every sale in the state–in store sales online sales private sales and of course sales at gun shows. Additionally after forcing every sale to go through a Federal Firearms License (FFL) this law also adds a $10 fee for every background check.Smith explained to Breitbart News that another asinine aspect of HB 1229 is that it incorporates a 72 hour rule; the law is written so that any time your gun is out of your possession for more than 72 hours you will have to do a background check before getting it back (which also means you will have to pay a $10 fee).They’ve written the law in a way that the difference between legality and illegality are undefined. They simply stress that the gun has to be in your possession at all times. They’ve tried to clarify this to mean under or within your domain. But let’s say you’re a Colorado resident in legal possession of gun you owned prior the the July 1 2013 deadline. You have an automobile accident and while the ambulance takes you to the hospital police find the gun in your vehicle. They hold the gun for you but you’re in the hospital longer than 72 hours. When you finally recover and leave the hospital you ask the police for your gun and they say you have to do a background check to get your own gun back because it’s been longer than 72 hours. Moreover you have a 17 round magazine in that gun and those are now banned and because it was out of your possession for longer than 72 hours you’ve forfeited it. This is a mess.The suit filed by Smith and his fellow Sheriffs is joined by numerous Colorado businesses and individual Colorado citizens. Said Smith: “We are a cantankerous bunch and this is our Alamo.”Follow AWR Hawkins on Twitter @AWRHawkins.,1
152,Even before President Obama announced his proposed gun control measures right-wing paranoids and Republican members of Congress were raving about impeachment incipient monarchy and civil war.Obama’s proposal is expected to include a call for banning military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines as well as strengthening the background check system for gun buyers. While Congress would have to approve those major steps he may also lay out 19 actions he can take by executive order such as mandating that federal agencies gather data on gun safety.In the wake of the schoolroom massacre in Newtown Conn. and many other brutal gun-related tragedies in recent months ideas for dealing with school safety and mental illness are also said to be on Obama’s list. But most of the attention will be directed at his gun control plan and much of it will be hotheaded and shrill.The usual gun rights lunatics are preemptively saying it may be necessary to take up arms to stop the government from confiscating everyone’s guns. Rabid rocker Ted Nugent has declared Obama’s proposals “psychotic” and said putting Vice President Joe Biden and Atty. Gen. Eric Holder in charge of the task force to come up with gun legislation is comparable to “hiring Jeffrey Dahmer to tell us how to take care of our children.”AdvertisementAlthough assault weapons have been banned in the past without a loss of liberty and no regulation Obama is considering comes close to negating the right to keep and bear arms one congressman from Texas said he would push impeachment of the president for trying to nullify the 2nd Amendment.Tea party hero Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky equated Obama’s proposed administrative actions with the monarchy of King George III and pledged to fight the president “tooth and nail” as if 2013 were 1776.Clearly the debate about guns is not going to be a reasoned discussion about how to better regulate the hundreds of millions of guns in America and keep them out of the hands of criminals and crazy people. At least on the right it will be an exercise in paranoia and fear-mongering.Meanwhile in the sane state of New York Republican and Democratic legislators have joined together to pass new gun restrictions that will ban high-capacity magazines strictly limit ownership of assault weapons and ban their sale online. They did it quickly in a bipartisan fashion and Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed the measure into law on Tuesday. So far the Empire State shows no sign of turning into a Stalinist nightmare. Other than the significant exceptions of Illinois and Michigan gun deaths are generally lower in states such as California that have strict guns laws. New York was on that list even before this newest law was passed.AdvertisementOf the annual 30000 gun deaths in the U.S. only 200 are homicides resulting from acts of self-defense according to the FBI. Still no one is talking about stripping away the right of anyone to own a gun to scare off a prowler or hold off a rapist (even though most people shot by guns in homes are relatives and friends). The only types of gun anyone is talking about restricting are the assault rifles that former Gens. Colin Powell and Stanley McChrystal say should only be in the hands of soldiers -- the kind of weapon used by a mentally unstable young man to murder first-graders in Newtown.But folks on the right disagree with the generals. Apparently that is the kind of weapon they think they may desperately need in the event of civil war against the would-be monarch in the White House.,0
153,"Story highlights CNN Opinion podcast features ""Big Three"" issues three commentators Dean Obeidallah: Get rid of the label ""gun control"" laws; they are really ""human safety"" laws Margaret Hoover defended Margaret Thatcher from views that she favored the rich John Avlon: It's almost impossible to talk about race in America without being attackedEditor’s Note: Dean Obeidallah a former attorney is a political comedian and frequent commentator on various TV networks including CNN. He is the editor of the politics blog The Dean’s Report and co-host of a new CNN podcast “The Big Three” that looks at the top three stories of the week. Follow him on Twitter @deanofcomedy.(CNN) —“I don’t consider criminal background checks to be gun control.”Republican U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey made this profound statement earlier this week while announcing a bipartisan Senate agreement to expand background checks to almost all gun purchasers.Toomey is absolutely correct. Background checks are not about gun control they’re about human safety. Having checks will make it more difficult for criminals and the insane to obtain guns.Yet despite polls showing that over 90% of Americans support universal background checks it took a “breakthrough” deal to get this proposal simply to a vote by the U.S. Senate. What’s worse there’s no guarantee this legislation will pass the Republican-controlled House.Congress’ exasperating struggle to enact a law supported by most Americans is topic No. 1 of this week’s episode of the CNN podcast “The Big Three” co-hosted by CNN Opinion contributors Margaret Hoover John Avlon and myself. Each week we look at three big issues from the week.The second big issue is the death of Great Britain’s former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Is the fawning over her justified or did her failings outweigh her accomplishments?And third is the new song by country singer Brad Paisley and rapper LL Cool J titled “The Accidental Racist” racially insensitive or in today’s hypersensitive climate is it simply impossible to discuss race without causing an outcry?To listen to this episode of “The Big Three” click on the Soundcloud audio player on this page. Or you can find us on iTunes.Here’s a brief summary of this week’s episode:1. Gun safety lawsNewsweek/Barry Morgenstein/Dean ObeidallahJohn Avlon discussed the cowardice of the Republican senators who threatened a filibuster to prevent a vote on the proposed universal background check law a point he also raised in his most recent column. Margaret Hoover – a reasonable voice on the right (almost an oxymoron) – agreed that Republican senators like Ted Cruz could cause the entire GOP to appear as extremists if they prevented a vote on this proposal via filibuster. I made the case that we need to stop calling these measures “gun control” laws and instead label them as “human safety” laws because the focus is on saving lives not grabbing guns.I also raised the point: Is the second amendment out of date? It was enacted when we had 13 states a population of 4 million and muskets. Should we consider revising or repealing the second amendment to bring it up to date with today’s world so that owning guns is a privilege rather than a right?2. Death of Margaret ThatcherMargaret Hoover a big Thatcher fan shared the thrill of meeting the former prime minister years ago. I refused to speak ill of the recently deceased Thatcher. So instead I read excerpts from a recent op-ed penned by British comedian Russell Brand (we all know comedians tend to write the best opinion pieces). Brand was highly critical of Thatcher’s reign. John and Margaret both defended Thatcher from Brand’s allegations that she was an uncaring person who favored the wealthy at the expense of the working class.Get our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook3. ‘The Accidental Racist’Paisley and LL Cool J recorded a song in the hopes of easing racial tension and fostering more understanding. Instead their song was met by almost universal criticism. Some said the lyrics are culturally insensitive others said it’s just bad. All three of us agreed that some of the lyrics were ridiculous such as LL Cool J’s line: “If you don’t judge my gold chains/I’ll forget the iron chains.” Was LL really saying that if a White man doesn’t judge his choice of flashy jewelry then Black Americans should forget slavery? But the bigger point we discussed is that it’s almost impossible to talk about race in America without being attacked by people on both the far left and far right. I also tell a joke about “White people” that I had performed last month on a TV show that generated an avalanche of angry tweets and e-mails. Just shows we’ve gone a long way to go.We hope you will give a listen to this episode of “The Big Three” – and let us know what you think about the issues we discussed.Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.",0

155,"Todd Spangler Detroit Free PressMajority of Michiganders support ban on assault weapons and background checks44%25 of respondents oppose Obama%27s planResults broke along party lines%2C with independents split 40%25 in favor%2C 42%25 opposedWASHINGTON -- Many Michigan residents may be suspicious when asked in general about President Barack Obama's proposals for gun control  however they appear to support the specific recommendations.A poll by EPIC-MRA of Lansing Mich. -- released exclusively to the Detroit Free Press and WXYZ-TV Detroit -- shows majority support among state residents for prohibiting the sale or possession of so-called assault weapons banning high-capacity ammunition magazines and requiring background checks for all firearm purchases.Those are three of the top suggestions made by Obama last month in the wake of the December school shootings in Newtown Conn. But when asked in general how they felt about ""President Obama's proposed changes in national gun laws"" 44% of respondents said they were opposed compared with 42% who were in favor. Fourteen percent were undecided.Taken together those results suggest that when it comes to people's opinions about gun control and the Second Amendment right to bear arms very little can be taken for granted.For instance Beverly Ballew 59 of Grosse Pointe Shores Mich. said while she could support increasing background checks limiting certain high-capacity ammunition magazines and prohibiting access to anything that could fire rounds repeatedly with a single pull of the trigger she remains suspicious of any proposals Obama puts forward.""I don't trust him No.1"" she said. ""No. 2 I'm very supportive of the Second Amendment.""For the poll EPIC-MRA surveyed 600 Michigan voters between Feb. 5-10. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.Despite splitting over Obama's proposals respondents supported banning high-capacity ammunition magazines by a 58%-38% margin and prohibiting the manufacture possession or sale of ""semi-automatic assault weapons such as the AK-47 or the AR-15 54%-43%.The margin was even higher for requiring background checks for all gun sales — with 86% in favor compared with 12% opposed.Rob Harris the media director for Michigan Open Carry a group which advocates the legality of unconcealed possession of firearms in public said the results show how potentially misleading the issue — and the terms used in the debate — can be.""Most people that you would come across in society today don't know what an assault weapon is"" he said. ""If you ask a general person they're going to say it's a machine gun and that's not the case. ... It's a scary word that scares a lot of people who are not in the know.""Steve Dulan with the Michigan Coalition for Responsible Gun Owners said many of the definitions applied in the gun debate have ""been an attempt to mislead people on this issue.""""I don't think that's even in question"" he said.Unlike a fully automatic weapon — such as those used by the military and some law enforcement — a semi-automatic assault weapon still requires a shooter to pull the trigger to fire each round. So-called assault weapons typically don't require a shooter to manually load another round and gun control advocates argue their military design is antithetical to sporting uses.Proposing a return of the assault weapon ban that expired in 2004 Obama said last month that weapons such as the rifle used in a shooting at an Aurora Colo. movie theater last summer ""when paired with high-capacity magazines"" have ""one purpose — to pump out as many bullets as possible as quickly as possible.""""These military style weapons there's no reason why anyone outside the military needs them"" said David L. Garrett Jr. 68 of Bloomfield Hills Mich.With a doctorate in chemistry Garrett — a retired chief materials engineer at General Motors and Delphi — said he has no problem with firearms for sport but semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines should be banned. He doubts it will happen though.""With the Republicans in office (and holding the majority in the U.S. House) not a chance"" he said.The EPIC-MRA poll showed that while self-described Democrats broke by a better than two-to-one margin in favor of Obama's recommendations and Republicans by a more than two-to-one margin against independent voters were split 40% in favor 42% against. Slightly more than half of men — 52% — were opposed to Obama's proposals compared with 38% in favor and 10% undecided; 45% of women were in favor compared with 36% against and 19% undecided.""I think it just shows that while Americans are united in their support for the Second Amendment it needs to go hand in hand with keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals"" said Zach Pohl executive director of Progress Michigan a liberal activist group.",1
156,The early voting in one of the two recall elections in Colorado is not looking very favorable for the incumbent. SenatePresident John Morse is in danger of getting thrown out forhis support for strict gun control laws passed in the 2013 session.Early voting began Thursday continued through Friday and Saturday and will resume Monday. The election is on Tuesday.The recall initiative was launched by gun rights activists against the Colorado Springs Democrat John Morse and Sen. Angela Giron of Pueblo because of their votes for the gun laws that include limiting the size of ammunition magazines and requiring universal background checks.The Denver Post reports that Republicans are dominating in the early voting in Morse’s district and Democrats will have a lot of votes to make up if they want to keep Morse in office.The vote totals so far from the El Paso County clerk and recorder show that although Republicans only comprise 26 percent of Morse’s Senate District 11 they account for 41 percent of the early voting.Here are the figures: VOTER REGISTRATION: 69481Unaffiliated: 26725 or 37.81%Democrats: 23344 or 33.59%Republicans: 18174 or 26.15%Libertarians: 716 or 1.03%Green Party: 278 or 0.40%American Constitution: 244 or 0.35% TURNOUT SO FAR: 9485Republicans: 3923 or 41.36%Democrats: 3081 or 32.48%Unaffiliated: 2351 or 24.7%Other: 130 or 1.37%Meanwhile Democrats are dominating in the recall voting for the other Democratic senator Angela Giron of Pueblo as it currently stands.,1
157,"Influential figures on both sides of the gun control debate tangled Wednesday over the effectiveness of background checks with the husband of wounded former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords urging an overhaul and a top National Rifle Association official saying ""homicidal maniacs"" will skirt the system no matter what.NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre was the final witness to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee as the panel begins to consider new legislation. He argued that more security and more enforcement but not new laws is the answer to gun violence.He specifically knocked down a call by President Obama and others for ""universal"" background checks particularly at gun shows.""When it comes to background checks let's be honest -- background checks will never be universal because criminals will never submit to them"" LaPierre said.But Giffords' husband Mark Kelly argued that improving the background check system should be a priority. He said holes in the law ""make a mockery"" of the system -- echoing Obama's recent proposal he called for submitting private sales to background checks as well. He further argued that stronger background checks could have prevented the mass shooting in January 2011 where his wife was shot in the head.LaPierre later got into an argument over the issue with Sen. Dick Durbin D-Ill. after LaPierre argued that more background checks would merely subject ""law-abiding people"" to more taxes and fees and hassle without going after ""bad guys.""""Mr. LaPierre that's the point"" Durbin said. ""The criminals won't get to purchase the guns because there'll be a background check. We'll stop them from the original purchase -- you missed that point completely. I think it's basic.""Raising his voice LaPierre said: ""Senator I think you missed the point!"" Chairman Patrick Leahy D-Vt. then banged the gavel and called for order.The disagreement was one of several sticking points as the Senate Judiciary Committee held the first gun control hearing since Obama released a comprehensive gun control plan earlier this month.LaPierre pressed for enforcing existing laws over creating new ones. ""Prosecuting criminals who misuse firearms works"" LaPierre testified. ""Unfortunately we've seen a dramatic collapse in federal gun prosecutions in recent years.""He continued: ""Proposing more gun control laws while failing to enforce the thousands we already have -- it's not a serious solution for reducing crime.""The panel was stacked with high-profile witnesses on both sides of the debate. Giffords who was shot while meeting with constituents outside an Arizona supermarket in January 2011 made a surprise appearance at the start of the hearing Wednesday morning to urge Congress to act.""We must do something"" Giffords said speaking slowly but clearly. ""It will be hard but the time is now. ... You must act.""Giffords urged lawmakers to ""be bold be courageous."" She later met with President Obama at the White House.""Violence is a big problem. Too many children are dying"" the former congresswoman said. Six people were killed and 12 were wounded in the Arizona attack. The fatal shooting at an elementary school in Newtown Conn. last month brought the issue of gun control back to the fore of the congressional agenda.Kelly speaking after his wife called for a ""careful and civil conversation"" about limitations on firearms. He noted that he and Giffords own guns but are ""anti-gun violence.""He said a ""matrix"" of failures contributes to the country's gun violence problem including mental illness and poverty but also gun laws. He said the complexity is ""not an excuse for inaction."" Kelly said weapons designed to inflict maximum damage have turned corners of America ""into places of carnage and gross human loss.""Kelly briefly described how the 2011 shooting affected his family leaving his wife partially blind and struggling to walk. Kelly and Giffords have formed a political action committee called Americans for Responsible Solutions to back lawmakers who support tighter gun restrictions and counter the influence of the NRA.LaPierre though argued that prosecution for federal weapons violations in 2011 was essentially down 35 percent compared to previous administrations which he says means violent felons gang members and the mentally ill who possess firearms are not being prosecuted.""That is completely and totally unacceptable"" said LaPierre who suggested fixing the country's ""broken"" mental-health system become part of the solution to gun violence -- including making patient records part of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.The hearing titled ""What Should America Do about Gun Violence"" takes place roughly seven weeks after a lone gunman with psychological problems used an assault weapon to kill 20 first-graders and six adults inside a Connecticut elementary school prompting renewed calls for more gun control.The NRA with 4.5 million active members remains the most powerful gun-rights advocacy group in the country.Obama is calling for a renewed ban on semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines along with more extensive background checks.LaPierre said the group is willing to work with Congress and the president in curbing gun violence but ""law-abiding gun owners will not accept blame for the acts of violent or deranged criminals. Nor do we believe the government should dictate what we can lawfully own and use to protect our families.""Under questioning from Sen. Chuck Schumer D-N.Y. Baltimore County Police Chief James Johnson said Wednesday that the current background check system has already stopped nearly 2 million ""prohibited purchases"" between 1994 and 2009.Sen. Dianne Feinstein D-Calif. has already introduced legislation taking similar steps to Obama's proposals.The California Democrat on Tuesday said she will hold her own hearing on gun control because she was unhappy that three of the five witnesses testifying Wednesday are ""skewed against us."" Feinstein is a member of the Judiciary Committee.Despite the momentum gun control advocates have gained since the massacre in Newtown Conn it will be difficult for them to prevail in Congress this year because of the popularity of guns in many states -- including several represented by Democratic senators -- and the formidable muscle of the NRA on Capitol Hill lawmakers and others say.Among other obstacles the Republican-run House has shown little immediate interest in making dramatic changes in the laws.At the Senate hearing Leahy D-Vt. said lawmakers were not trying to take away Americans' guns.""They're not at risk. ... what is at risk are lives"" he said.The committee's top Republican Sen. Charles Grassley said he welcomed the ""renewed discussion"" on gun violence.But he voiced skepticism about a renewed ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. ""Those can be circumvented by carrying multiple guns"" Grassley said.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",0

160,"Apparently no government is too small to get between you your doctor and your health insurer.A controversial initiative that would require women to buy an additional rider on their health insurance if they wanted abortion coverage is one short step away from going to the Legislature where it is likely to easily become law. Because no one filed a challenge by Monday’s deadline to the more than 315000 signatures turned in to the Secretary of State an initiative that would prohibit abortion coverage from being included in standard insurance policies will go forward. And the Secretary of State certified Monday that Michigan Right to Life which spearheaded the petition drive has more than enough valid signatures to start the ball rolling on the new state law. A minimum of 258088 valid signatures were needed. The anti-abortion activists turned in 315477 signatures. And the Secretary of State’s elections division estimated that 299941 of the signatures are valid. The state Board of Canvassers will meet at 9:30 a.m. Dec. 2 to certify the signatures and then the petition moves to the state Legislature which has 40 days to approve reject or do nothing with the legislative ballot initiative.If Republicans vote it down or fail to act on it it will be a ballot iniatitive in the next general election. Neither of these is likely given their ideologically extreme views. If they pass it it becomes law. The other 95.8% of us won’t have a say and neither will Governor Snyder.Oh and by the way most Michigan voters actually oppose the law.Don't tell me there isn't a War on Women in Michigan being waged by religious conservatives in our state.

161,“Young adults are one diagnosis one motorcycle accident one car accident away from a lifetime of [medical] bills” Sebelius said. Health insurance obtained through the Affordable Care Act could “save them and their families from bankruptcy.”Sure millennials are often the healthiest members of the population and they may believe they’re invincible. It’s estimated as many as 16 million don’t have adequate insurance. But a broken bone or a middle-of-the-night appendicitis attack can wreck a 20-something’s financial future.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementWe know: My college-student daughter’s minor surgery done as an outpatient in April would have cost $30000 if she hadn’t been covered on my husband’s insurance (an early perk of the Affordable Care Act has allowed 2.5 million adult children up to age 26 who otherwise wouldn’t have insurance to remain on their parents’ policies). Even with the policy the bills have amounted to nearly $3000 for out-of-pocket expenses.Yet an activist group called Generation Opportunity with funding ties to the conservative Koch Brothers claims on its Web site that “there are better cheaper options” than the Affordable Care Act for fellow millennials. The group fails to list what those choices might be.The Virginia-based group which is responsible for the Uncle Sam videos has announced a $750000 effort to persuade young adults “to opt out” of using the soon-to-be-available health exchanges or health insurance marketplace to buy policies from private companies. As part of that campaign the group will take its show on the road to some 20 college campuses across the country.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“We want young people to know they have options — including the ability to opt out of Obamacare by paying a relatively small penalty” Evan Feinberg president of Generation Opportunity said in a news release. That penalty will be $95 or 1 percent of income in 2014; it will gradually increase.Feinberg refers to Obamacare as a “quite frankly creepy pyramid scheme” and explains that his group is “relying on creativity and grassroots activism” to fight it.I guess you could call the Uncle Sam ads which were posted on YouTube Thursday and have since gone viral as “creative.”In one ad Uncle Sam pops up at the foot of an exam table while a young woman has her legs in the stirrups (a vulnerable position believe me). She screams and on the screen flash the words “Don’t let government play doctor.” Then we’re treated to a close-up of Uncle Sam brandishing a speculum.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIn the other video it’s the young man’s turn looking worried (a lot of jaw-clenching going on) as he lies on his side knees to his chest his backside exposed. Uncle Sam magically appears snaps on a pair of blue rubber gloves and wriggles his fingers in anticipation.Irony anyone? Hasn’t it been members of the Republican Party playing doctor by passing legislation in a number of states requiring any woman considering an abortion to undergo an ultrasound with a transvaginal probe — a most invasive and uncomfortable procedure?The plan is simple for Generation Opportunity. They hope to undermine Obamacare by underfunding the program. The White House has estimated that at least 2.7 million of the 7 million people expected to sign up for health insurance through the health exchanges need to be young adults. If enough healthy young adults fail to buy private insurance through the health exchanges the companies will lack the funds to pay out claims for older and often sicker customers.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBut will it be that easy to win over the hearts and minds — and wallets — of the millennials? More than 27 percent of adults age 18 to 24 have no health insurance. But the idea that most of them believe they don’t need it may be just another myth like so much of the misinformation on the Affordable Care Act.Only a fourth of them think they’re healthy enough that they don’t need health insurance according to research by the Kaiser Foundation while a study by the Commonwealth Fund found that the majority of adults age 30 and under would buy insurance if they could afford it.Because of Obamacare preexisting conditions will no longer prevent some young adults from purchasing a policy. “In the past a teenage girl could take Accutane for acne and then be denied health insurance for a preexisting condition” Sebelius said.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementOr as she explained earlier during the “Mental Health Matters” conference to enthusiastic applause “Being a woman is no longer considered a preexisting condition.”I can’t help but compare health insurance and auto insurance. We’re required in many states to show proof of car insurance before we can get a license for the vehicle. And most of us would never dream of buying a nice car — but then refusing to get insurance.,0
162,"Republicans in Wisconsin aren't done regulating lady parts despite 2 bills passed earlier that vastly restrict abortions and mandate ultrasounds. The quickly rammed through bills were signed in secret by Scott Walker who wanted to avoid the publicity that dogged Republicans in Virginia and caused the Governor of that state to be renamed ""Governor Ultrasound"".They're not done exerting more control over womens bodies and one State Senator is promising ""all out hell"" if they proceed.A Democratic state senator promised ""all out hell"" next week if Republicans stick to their plan to take up a controversial bill restricting abortion for public workers and limiting access to contraception for employees of religious organizations. Sen. Jon Erpenbach (D-Middleton) said Tuesday's session could mirror one in June when Senate President Mike Ellis (R-Neenah) broke the base of his gavel as he slammed it down to quiet Democrats upset over passing a different abortion bill. Footage of those raucous proceedings was featured in an ad targeting Ellis run by Planned Parenthood Advocates of Wisconsin. Republicans who run the Senate are tentatively planning to approve two abortion bills on Tuesday. One would ban any abortions that are sought because of the sex of the fetus. The other would prevent public employees' health plans from covering most abortions and would also strictly limit the ability of employees of religious organizations to get contraception through their insurance plans.That's right. If you're a public employee you won't be able to get an abortion and if you work for a religious organization (like a hospital) no birth control for you.In case you've forgotten this is how Republicans rammed through these bills in June with only 1 speaker and no debate:Yes Mike Ellis broke his gavel telling Democrats to sit down and shut up. After the ram through the State Senate as you can see quickly adjourned. Democracy doesn't exist for the GOP.",0
163,"One day later yesterday and only two weeks since the Republicans introduced it the bill passed the House on a 56 to 39 vote. During what passed for debate the citizens in the gallery sat silent some with duct tape over their mouths. The gallery was lined with Capitol Police whose job it is to oversee the increasingly detailed and labyrinthine sets of rules of conduct and laws restricting assembly that have been put in place during the last two years. It has been clear that signage is no longer allowed in the gallery nor is photography nor recording devices of any kinds. I don't know that we were cognizant that silence would not be allowed. That's right: in Wisconsin our silence has been silenced!According to the twitter stream of Madison writer and activist Rebecca Kemble's eyewitness account:Women with tape over their mouths silently protesting #gynogovt in Assembly Gallery told to take it off. Some of them ejected. #WarOnWomenRep. Pasch on AB 216: ""The author of this bill is seriously out of touch with the reality of women."" #gynogovt #WarOnWomenApplause from the gallery causes Speaker Pro Tem Kramer to have people removed without a warning. #gynogovt #WarOnWomenDems protesting Kramer's ejection of the public from the gallery without a warning. #gynogovt #WarOnWomenWomen in the gallery who removed tape from their mouths on the order of Speaker Pro Tem Kramer now holding hands over mouths. #gynogovtClapping spontaneously erupted after Democratic Representative Sandy Pasch spoke of the importance of access to birth control for women:One woman was handcuffed and marched out due to her unwillingness to leave the gallery when Rep. Kramer cleared the first two rows due to clapping.I'll end with that chilling image. A radical bill of serious consequence was fast-tracked through legislature and now waits to be signed by Governor Walker. He's already said that he has no problem with ultrasounds and will readily sign. The Senate allowed no debate insisting on a rapid and violent roll-call vote. The House allowed the performance of debate and voted along party lines. The citizens watching from the galleries above were surrounded by police. There were no outbursts no incivility only one instance of clapping. The first two rows were immediately ejected without warning by the order of the Republican Speaker.Women sitting silently with duct tape on their mouths were given the ultimatum: take off your tape or face arrest.

164,"In 1970 Washington became the first -- and remains the only -- state in the country to legalize elective abortions by a popular vote.A generation later and 40 years removed from the landmark United States Supreme Court Roe v. Wade ruling that extended abortion access nationwide Washington is once again poised to stand out.With 21 states having adopted bans or severe restrictions on insurance companies from paying for abortions Washington is alone in seriously considering legislation mandating the opposite.The Reproductive Parity Act as supporters call it would require insurers in Washington state who cover maternity care -- which all insurers must do -- to also pay for abortions.The bill passed the state House earlier this month by a vote of 53-43 though it faces an uncertain future in the Senate. A similar bill in the New York state Assembly has been introduced each session for over a decade but has never received a public hearing.""This is a core value for Washingtonians"" said Melanie Smith a lobbyist for NARAL Pro-Choice Washington. ""We should protect it while we still have it and not leave access to basic health care up to an insurance company.""The proximate cause of Washington state's measure is the federal Affordable Care Act. Thanks to language placed in it to assuage anti-abortion congressional Democrats insurers selling their plans on the state exchanges taking effect next year will have to segregate the premiums they collect for abortion coverage.In addition to that built-in disincentive to insuring abortion the law also invites states to enact stricter rules of their own. Thus far 16 states have followed suit barring or restricting insurance companies on their exchanges from covering the procedure. Three of those states are joining the five that have barred or limited all insurers from covering abortions since the early 1980's.Supporters of Washington state's proposed abortion insurance mandate are careful to stress that it wouldn't lead to a dramatic uptick in abortions or require carriers with a religious bent to cover the procedure. They also note that a pair of federal plans that will be sold on all 50 state exchanges will be barred from covering elective abortions.""It's not expanding abortion coverage"" said Democratic Rep. Eileen Cody of West Seattle the bill's primary sponsor. ""It's ensuring the rights of women to get what they're paying for now and to continue their freedom of choice.""Opponents counter that the measure would require businesses and individuals to pay for abortion coverage they'd rather not have.""Washington state would be the only state in the country that would force employers to pay for abortion"" said Peggy O'Ban spokeswoman for Human Life of Washington.If passed she said it would amount to ""the first conscience coercion act in American history.""Its passage however is not assured.Proponents of the measure say they have the votes they need in the state Senate but it's not clear that Senate leaders will allow it to get to the floor. It is scheduled to receive a public hearing in the Senate Health Care Committee on April 1.Ironically the man bill supporters will likely blame if it fails to get a Senate vote counts himself as a proud backer of the measure.Sen. Rodney Tom of Medina a fiscal conservative and social moderate and one other like-minded Democrat crossed party lines to caucus with Republicans in December handing a one-vote majority to the GOP. Seizing power for the first time in nearly a decade elated Senate Republicans reciprocated by installing Tom as Majority Leader.Last month Tom addressed about 250 advocates rallying for the measure's passage on the state Capitol steps.""I'm down here making sure that my 17-year-old daughter has the kind of protections that we need in Washington state and that all of our kids have those same kinds of protections"" Tom said to cheers.Moments later Gov. Jay Inslee a Democrat and fellow bill supporter delivered a not-so-subtle challenge to Tom's political will.Washington state ""deserves a vote in the state Senate on the Reproductive Parity Act"" Inslee said. ""We are going to insist that we are not going to let anybody close the door to democracy in this state.""Another irony: though the bill has proved to be among the most hotly contested of the session its broader impact if passed may be less than sweeping.For one thing most abortions are paid for out-of-pocket. According to the Guttmacher Institute only 12 percent of abortions nationwide are paid for by private insurers with 20 percent footed by Medicaid.For another because most abortions cost less than a live birth -- the procedure typically runs about $500 though late-term abortions are far more expensive -- insurers may be disinclined to stop covering them.At present all major insurers in Washington state cover abortions and Cody the bill's sponsor said she knows of no carrier with plans to change. Insurers new to Washington state on its exchange may be tempted to adopt different policies she said.No matter its immediate impact said Elizabeth Nash states issues manager with the Guttmacher Institute the bill's passage would be a watershed event.""It would be a model for other states to follow"" she said.",0

Rather I was simply relaying the truth about conversations I've had with my colleagues and the factors they considered on the expansion of Medicaid.""While others are using this as an opportunity to take my comments out of context in order to distract from the true issue I think it's critical that we focus on the substance of the policy because it's the right thing to do for Louisiana.""[youtube K754cP25fK4]",1
166,"AUSTIN Texas (AP) — The Texas Senate passed sweeping new abortion restrictions late Friday sending them to Republican Gov. Rick Perry to sign into law after weeks of protests and rallies that drew thousands of people to the Capitol and made the state the focus of the national abortion debate.Republicans used their large majority in the Texas Legislature to pass the bill nearly three weeks after a filibuster by Democratic Sen. Wendy Davis and an outburst by abortion-rights activists in the Senate gallery disrupted a deadline vote June 25.Called back for a new special session by Perry lawmakers took up the bill again as thousands of supporters and opponents held rallies and jammed the Capitol to testify at public hearings. As the Senate took its final vote protesters in the hallway outside the chamber chanted ""Shame! Shame! Shame!""Democrats have called the GOP proposal unnecessary and unconstitutional. Republicans said the measure was about protecting women and unborn children.House Bill 2 would require doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals allow abortions only in surgical centers limit where and when women may take abortion-inducing pills and ban abortions after 20 weeks.Abortion-rights supporters say the bill will close all but five abortion clinics in Texas leaving large areas of the vast state without abortion services. Only five out of 42 existing abortion clinics meet the requirements to be a surgical center and clinic owners say they can't afford to upgrade or relocate.The circus-like atmosphere in the Texas Capitol marked the culmination of weeks of protests the most dramatic of which came June 25 in the final minutes of the last special legislative session Davis' filibuster and subsequent protest prevented the bill from becoming law.The Senate's debate took place between a packed gallery of demonstrators with anti-abortion activists wearing blue and abortion-rights supporters wearing orange. Security was tight and state troopers reported confiscating bottles of urine and feces as they worked to prevent another attempt to stop the Republican majority from passing the proposal.Story continuesThose arrested or removed from the chamber included four women who tried to chain themselves to a railing in the gallery. One of the women was successful in chaining herself prompting a 10-minute recess.When debate resumed protesters began loudly singing ""Give choice a chance. All we are saying is give choice a chance."" The Senate's leader Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst told officers to remove them.Sen. Glen Hegar of Katy the bill's Republican author argued that all abortions including those induced with medications should take place in an ambulatory surgical center in case of complications.Democrats pointed out that childbirth is more dangerous than an abortion and there have been no serious problems with women taking abortion drugs at home. They introduced amendments to add exceptions for cases of rape and incest and to remove some of the more restrictive clauses but Republicans dismissed all of the proposed changes.Sen. Royce West a Dallas Democrat asked why Hegar was pushing restrictions that federal courts in other states had suspended as possibly unconstitutional.""There will be a lawsuit. I promise you"" West said raising his right hand as if taking an oath.The bill mirrors restrictions passed in Mississippi Ohio Oklahoma Alabama Kansas Wisconsin and Arizona. In North Carolina lawmakers are considering a measure that would allow state health officials to apply standards for ambulatory surgical centers to abortion clinics.Passing the law in Texas would be a major victory for anti-abortion activists in the nation's second most-populous state. A lawsuit originating in Texas would also likely win a sympathetic hearing at the conservative 5th Circuit Court of Appeals on its way to the U.S. Supreme Court.But Democrats see in the protests an opportunity that could help them break a 20-year statewide losing streak. They believe Republicans have overreached in trying to appease their base and alienated suburban women a constituency that helped President Barack Obama win re-election.""In the long run all they have done is built a committed group of people across this state who are outraged about the treatment of women and the lengths to which this Legislature will go to take women's health care away"" Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards told The Associated Press in an interview Friday.Sen. John Whitmire a Houston Democrat said during the debate that it was clear the bill was part of national conservative agenda attempting to ban abortion and infringe on women's rights one state at a time. He pressed Hegar on why the Texas Medical Association Texas Hospital Association and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology opposed the bill.He asked Hegar how he could ignore these experts.""There are differences in the medical profession"" Hegar insisted rejecting the criticism. ""I don't believe this legislation will majorly impede the doctor-patient relationship.""Sen.

168,"The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to block controversial Texas abortion restrictions that have been called some of the strictest in the country and have led a dozen abortion clinics in the state to stop performing the procedure.The court by a 5-4 vote denied a request by Planned Parenthood to block a ruling by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals allowing key parts of the Texas abortion law to stay in effect while the lawsuit challenging the restrictions moves forward.The four liberal justices who voted in favor of the request said they would have overturned the appeals court's Oct. 31 ruling that allowed the law to take effect.In its 20-page ruling the panel of appeals court judges acknowledged that the law's provision requiring doctors to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital ""may increase the cost of accessing an abortion provider and decrease the number of physicians available to perform abortions.""However the panel said that the U.S. Supreme Court has held that having ""the incidental effect of making it more difficult or more expensive to procure an abortion cannot be enough to invalidate"" a law that serves a valid purpose ""one not designed to strike at the right itself."" The provision has led at least 12 clinics in the state to stop performing abortions since the ruling.A spokeswoman for the Texas Attorney General's Office said Tuesday said the office is ""pleased"" with the Supreme Court's ruling.""These are commonsense - and perfectly constitutional - regulations that further the state's interest in protecting the health and safety of Texas women"" Lauren Bean said.Republican Texas Gov. Rick Perry also said he was happy with the court's decision.""This is good news both for the unborn and for the women of Texas who are now better protected from shoddy abortion providers operating in dangerous conditions"" Perry said.The appeals court panel left in place a portion of a previous judge's order that prevents the state from enforcing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration protocol for abortion-inducing drugs in cases where the woman is between 50 and 63 days into her pregnancy. Doctors testifying before the court had said such women would be harmed if the protocol were enforced.The appeals court's order is temporary until it can hold a complete hearing likely in January.The restrictions gained notoriety when Democratic state Sen. Wendy Davis launched a nearly 13-hour filibuster against them in June.The law also bans abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and beginning in October 2014 requires doctors to perform all abortions in surgical facilities.During the trial officials for one chain of abortion clinics testified that they've tried to obtain admitting privileges for their doctors at 32 hospitals but so far only 15 accepted applications and none have announced a decision.Many hospitals with religious affiliations will not allow abortion doctors to work there while others fear protests if they provide privileges.Many have requirements that doctors live within a certain radius of the facility or perform a minimum number of surgeries a year that must be performed in a hospital.Fox News' Shannon Bream and The Associated Press contributed to this report",1

Nikki Haley's Republican Party.The better the access to health care for her constituents the poorer the odds for South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley's Republican Party.Medicaid rolls in South Carolina will grow by about 162000 people by the middle of 2015. Had the state expanded Medicaid another 340000 people would get coverage. As it is at least many more children will be covered and their parents will probably find out in the process that if their governor hadn't been such an asshole they would have coverage too.From Joan's earlier piece on South Carolina's expanding Medicaid rolls Even in South Carolina a state hostile to Obamacare expansion hundreds of thousands of people are benefiting just from greater awareness of existing government programs for which theyqualify. And while most of those beneficiaries are children those children have families who would appreciate access to similar services if only Republicans would get out of the way.But South Carolina is solidly Red right? Romney won the state by 11 points right? So it doesn't matter! Except that in raw totals Romney won by around 204000 votes. And Republicans assume (perhaps rightly) that every Obamacare beneficiary will become much more favorable toward the government. And if you start thinking government can help you Republicans don't stand a chance.So for the them it's bad enough that nearly 200000 South Carolina residents (mostly children) will soon be part of their so-called ""culture of dependency"". That alone has potentially negative electoral ramifications. But had South Carolina taken federal dollars to give another 340000 of its residents access to low-cost health services their entire GOP's existence would be imperiled.That's why Republicans continue to fight tooth and nail against Obamacare from seeking its repeal to sabotaging its rollout. It's an existential crisis. The more people benefit the harder it will be for them to argue that government is irreparably broken and must be drowned in Grover Norquist's bathtub.",1

And there is another worry — reports sent to insurance companies about who has enrolled in health plans include errors that could cause problems when people try to use their new insurance plans next year.Administration officials in talking to reporters were careful not to declare a full-fledged victory. In a report issued Sunday officials with the Department of Health and Human Services said the next few months would require further work to “improve and enhance the website and continue to improve the consumer experience.” Officials have also said repeatedly that consumers might still encounter difficulties and urged them to use the call center and seek help from specially trained personnel.View Graphic A look at the consumer's route through the HealthCare.gov website and the potential failure points.Still the announcement is a milestone for the administration which has struggled to improve the Web site since its botched Oct. 1 launch.New challenges lie ahead. Most Americans are required to have health insurance starting Jan. 1 and the administration is racing to meet its now-tougher goal of enrolling 7 million uninsured people in health coverage by the end of March.When the Web site launched the uninsured as well as people who were looking for better or cheaper coverage were supposed to be able to go online to browse plans and rates apply for subsidies and enroll in health plans. But many have encountered numerous technical difficulties on HealthCare.gov the main portal for 36 states as well as on a number of state-run Web sites.Fixing the federal Web site was a crucial first step for the administration to restore trust in the health program which has suffered in the polls this fall. It was also critical from a practical standpoint; people buying insurance on the marketplaces have until Dec. 23 to sign up for health plans that take effect on Jan. 1.It may be hard to assess how well the site has met expectations until it handles a higher volume of visitors as Dec. 23 approaches.The announcement offered some relief to Democratic lawmakers who have struggled to defend the administration’s handling of the law.“This is the equivalent of having a great item that you want to buy in the store but not being able to get through the front door” Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) said Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “It sounds like the front door has been opened successfully now.”Republicans said additional flaws in the site would soon emerge.“When this Web site gets fixed the problems really start for this administration” former senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”Zients on his call with reporters said the number of people on the site was higher Saturday than it had been for all but the first days after the exchange launched.Among those who tried to log on was Sandy Kush 49 an unemployed medical transcriptionist from Illinois who tried six times in October to use HealthCare.gov with no success.She tried again Sunday and with the help of a call-center representative was able to enroll in Medicaid — a stopgap measure she said until she can find a new job that offers insurance. The whole experience took about an hour and a half but “was pretty smooth” she said.Others reported problems getting all the way through the process. Liz Gallops 33 a North Carolina insurance broker who has tried unsuccessfully to get coverage through the site said that HealthCare.gov seemed to be working better Sunday but that at one point she got a message stating that the system “cannot finish your application now.”In the HHS report ad­ministration officials offered a harsh assessment of the HealthCare.gov project and blamed the problems on hundreds of software bugs and inadequate hardware and infrastructure as well as poor leadership.“The system monitoring and response mechanisms were not sufficient for identifying issues or bugs or responding to them in real time” it said. “Inadequate management oversight and coordination among technical teams prevented real-time decision making and efficient responses to address the issues with the site.”But the officials said they had reorganized over the past five weeks and had put one firm in charge of the fixes held “war room” meetings on critical issues and changed the decision-making culture so their team is “operating with private-sector velocity and effectiveness.”Zients said workers made more than 400 bug fixes and upgraded the software used for the enrollment process. The results are additional capacity a faster response time and much-improved stability on the Web site he said. About 50 fixes were made Saturday night Zients said.“We have a much more stable system that’s reliably open for business” he said. “HealthCare.gov can now support intended volumes.”The HHS report concluded that most of the department’s benchmarks for this weekend had been met. The average system response time when a person calls up a page on the Web site is under one second and the rate at which people are encountering error messages is “consistently well below 1 percent” the report saidThe online system is stable — not crashing — more than 90 percent of the time officials said. And the report said that the site can handle as many as 50000 shoppers at the same time and up to 800000 visits a day.The report said the administration has yet to meet at least one of its key goals: reducing the site’s average response time to half a second. And government officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing operations cautioned last week that they will not know if they have expanded the site’s carrying capacity to 50000 users at once until they have that many users online.Administration officials said they have set up a system to help consumers if they cannot immediately get access to the site during peak demand. If consumers visit the site when it is at capacity they may leave an e-mail address to receive a notification from the site with a link that allows them to “go to the front of the queue when they come back to the site” Zients said.During the daytime Sunday the site did not attract anywhere near the maximum number of users that HHS officials say HealthCare.gov should now be able to handle. The peak usage per hour came about noon when 16259 people were on the site at once according to a government official with knowledge of the project.Meanwhile throughout the day Sunday the site was meeting the administration’s target of an error rate of less than 1 percent the official said but the speed at which pages were loaded was roughly one per second double the goal of a half-second.The report did not address the “back-end” parts of the systems that consumers do not see including the error-filled enrollment reports. Insurers have warned that if the problem is not fixed soon some people may show up for doctor’s appointments in January only to find that the insurance company has no record of their enrollment.“Insurers are still receiving enrollment files that are duplicative or include missing or inaccurate information” Robert Zirkelbach spokesman for America’s Health Insurance Plans the industry’s main lobbying group said Sunday. “In some cases they aren’t receiving those enrollment files at all.”In recent months consumers having difficulty with the Web site have been turning to agents and brokers for help. But the system does not allow brokers to enter their identity numbers once a person has gotten a subsidy determination or if the number has been added incorrectly in the past.Without those identity numbers brokers cannot get paid by insurers or follow up on behalf of clients if there are problems with insurance claims. Regulators cannot track down brokers if there are mistakes. As of Sunday brokers had not been informed of any fix to this issue.Repairing those problems is critical because “we could get a lot of people enrolled very quickly” said Janet Trautwein chief executive of the National Association of Health Underwriters which represents about 200000 agents and brokers who together serve about 2 million to 3 million clients.In addition when consumers turn for help to a broker an insurer or a call center the online system still is balking at the critical step of calculating how much each person can qualify for in federal subsidies. Without that information these assisters cannot complete the process of enrolling most consumers for health plans.Emily Wax-Thibodeaux Sarah Kliff Juliet Eilperin Amy Goldstein and Sean Sullivan contributed to this report.,1

175,"As soon as Virginia state Sen. Mark Obenshain (R) won the Republican nomination for attorney general this weekend Think Progress dug up a bill he introduced in 2009 that would have required a woman to report her miscarriage to the police within 24 hours of it happening or risk jail time.A spokesperson for Obenshain told HuffPost on Monday that the senator introduced the bill in response to a news story about a 20-year-old college student who allegedly disposed of her dead newborn in the trash in Rockingham County Virginia. Jared Walczak Obenshain's deputy campaign manager for policy said Obenshain was trying to pass a law to enable law enforcement to prosecute a woman in that circumstance but he ended up with a bill that threatened all pregnant women with prosecution in the event that they miscarry.""As sometimes happens the legislation that emerged was far too broad and would have had ramifications that neither he nor the Commonwealth's attorney's office ever intended"" Walczak said. ""Sen. Obenshain is strongly against imposing any added burden for women who suffer a miscarriage and that was never the intent of the legislation.""Walczak said Obenshain met with representatives of Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia in an attempt to resolve the problem but he was unable to come up with a solution so he withdrew the bill.NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia confirmed that Obenshain reached out to them about the bill in 2009 and they told him they did not support it.Tarina Keene the group's executive director told HuffPost ""In 2009 we made it clear to Sen. Obenshain that NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia vehemently opposed his bill to criminalize tragic pregnancy complications and intimidate grieving Virginian women with the threat of law enforcement -- not to mention jail time. Although Sen. Obenshain did reach out to us amidst public backlash for a 'solution' we clearly told him we would support nothing but immediate defeat of the legislation. While I'm relieved that he eventually decided to pull his bill it is deeply troubling that an elected official would even consider such a callous and insulting effort.""Obenshain joins a wave of far-right social conservatives running for office in Virginia including gubernatorial candidate and current attorney general Ken Cuccinelli and his running mate Bishop E.W. Jackson.

176,"A two-year budget bill advanced by Ohio's state House of Representatives on Tuesday would defund Planned Parenthood redirect that state money to Christian-run ""crisis pregnancy centers"" and impose a fine of up to $5000 on teachers who provide certain kinds of sex education instruction to their students.The sex education amendment to the budget bill introduced by Rep. Lynn Wachtmann (R) encourages schools to teach abstinence-only education and bans sexual education that condones ""any gateway sexual activity or health message that encourages students to experiment with sexual activity."" The amendment also prohibits teachers from distributing contraceptive materials and bans public schools from using the services of any individual or organization who “endorses student nonabstinence from sexual activity as an appropriate or acceptable behavior or if that individual or organization promotes endorses advocates or condones gateway sexual activity.”Instructors who violate the law could be sued in court for up to $5000.State Democratic Chairman Chris Redfern told the Toledo Blade that Republicans are “bent on outlawing sexuality and reverting to the Dark Ages.""""If this legislature focused on what really mattered we could get a lot done. Instead too many of my colleagues have this bizarre attraction to these extreme issues"" he said.Wachtmann did not immediately return HuffPost's calls for comment.Another provision of the House budget bill would redirect about $1.4 million in state family planning funds from Planned Parenthood to other local health providers and crisis pregnancy centers which are Christian-owned organizations whose mission is to convince women not to have abortions. Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio provides health and family planning services to about 100000 women each year at 27 clinics across the state. If the bill passes all of the Planned Parenthood clinics would be moved to the bottom of the priority list for state funding because three of them provide abortions.All abortions provided at Planned Parenthood clinics are paid for privately by the patient because the Hyde Amendment prohibits any federal dollars from being used to fund the procedure. But Republicans have long argued that Planned Parenthood indirectly uses public grants to pay for all of its services including abortions.State Rep. Ron Maag (R-Lebanon) said at a hearing on the bill last week that if Planned Parenthood wants to receive more federal funds it should stop providing abortions at all of its clinics. “If the hang-up is abortion and you only have three clinics that are doing it and there are other places women could go why do you persist in having those clinics when it is putting your good work in jeopardy?” he asked Stephanie Kight president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio.Kight said the thousands of Ohio women who use Planned Parenthood as their primary health care provider can attest to the fact that it is not a bottom-tier provider. “It’s interesting that they would introduce a bill that would require us to be something that we’re not while we’re the most-trusted provider for women’s health care"" in the state she said.",0
177,In the public relations push for his takeover of the American health care system President Obama promised that those who like their insurance could keep it premiums would decrease and no one would lose their doctor. We know now those were all lies told repeatedly and never questioned by a media that is still looking the other way. Another promise Obama made was that ObamaCare would not fund abortions. LifeNews reports that this was also a lie:The ObamaCare statute specifically requires the issuers of Exchange plans that cover abortion to “collect from each enrollee in the plan” a “separate payment” for the type of abortions for which funding is prohibited under the Hyde Amendment (which is all abortions other than in cases of life of the mother rape or incest) and a separate payment for all other services. [42 U.S.C. 18023(b)]. These separate payments are then to be deposited into separate accounts.During the regulatory process commenters questioned HHS on how this was to be implemented and according to HHS the commenters “recommended that HHS clarify . . . whether [Exchange plan] issuers may satisfy the separate payment provision by providing each enrollee with an itemized bill and whether an enrollee’s coverage would be terminated for failure to comply with the separate payment provision.” Rather than doing so HHS merely said that the comments would be taken into consideration in any future guidance. [77 Fed. Reg. 18430 (March 27 2012)].Now despite the clear language of the ObamaCare statute it appears that the separate check requirement is not going to be enforced by the Obama Administration. Gretchen Borchelt director of state reproductive health policy at the National Women’s Law Center told the Huffington Post that “we used to talk about it as being two checks that the consumer would have to write because of the segregation requirements but that’s not the way it’s being implemented.” (Huffington Post Sept. 3 2013).Likewise a spokeswoman for Rhode Island’s Exchange told PolitiFact Rhode Island that “the customer is not billed a separate fee.” (Politifact Oct. 2 2013. The Rhode Island Exchange will handle the billing not the plan issuers). As PolitiFact notes “it turns out to be a hidden fee.”There is nothing the media is willing to make Obama pay a political price for. Not even repeatedly lying to millions who are about to lose their insurance or forcing people to violate their conscience over the abomination of abortion.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC,0
178,"Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell (R) introduced an amendment to the state's health insurance exchange implementation bill that would prevent insurance plans in the new health exchange from covering abortion.While similar bills introduced in other states would allow a woman to buy a policy rider for abortion coverage McDonnell's proposed amendment late Monday night would ban that as well.""No qualified health insurance plan that is sold or offered for sale through an exchange established or operating in the Commonwealth shall provide coverage for abortions regardless of whether such coverage is provided through the plan or is offered as a separate optional rider thereto"" the amendment reads adding that women who have become pregnant from rape or incest or whose lives are in danger would be exempt from the ban.Most private insurance plans in the U.S. include abortion coverage. NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia estimates that the ban on abortion coverage in Virginia will affect about 50000 women in Virginia -- the estimated number who will be using state-based health benefits exchange.NARAL Planned Parenthood and other reproductive rights advocacy groups condemned the amendment because it could prevent many low-income women from being able to access abortion care.“With this amendment Governor McDonnell has launched yet another effort to intrude in women’s health care decisions and block Virginians access to comprehensive reproductive health care"" said Caroline O’Shea deputy director of NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia in a statement. ""Coverage for safe legal abortion care -- a procedure one in three women will access in their lifetimes - is a basic benefit that most insurance plans currently include. By banning women from using their own funds to purchase plans that include this common benefit Gov. McDonnell is restricting Virginians’ personal economic decisions as well as their access to comprehensive care.""McDonnell's office did not respond to The Huffington Post's request for comment.Anti-abortion advocacy groups and state lawmakers have been lobbying McDonnell for weeks to propose the abortion coverage amendment. Virginia delegate Bob Marshall (R) who has introduced several anti-abortion bills in the House of Delegates this year that have not gone to a vote sent out an aggressive email blast to his supporters last week.""The Governor and Republican House and Senate leaders completely ignored any new legislative efforts to protect preborn children in the 2013 session because they wanted to avoid controversy in an election year"" he wrote. ""If Gov. McDonnell does not hear from many principled pro-lifers like yourself he may continue to do nothing to protect our conscience from the HHS Mandate or to prohibit abortion coverage in health exchanges.""",0
179,Back to previous pageCruz ends anti-Obamacare talkathon after 21 hoursSen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) ended his marathon talking attack on President Obama’s health-care law Wednesday after 21 hours and 19 minutes — a feat of stamina that seems likely to complicate House GOP efforts to pass a funding bill aimed at averting a looming government shutdown.The freshman senator ceded the floor — and got his first opportunity for a bathroom break — at noon after running up against a deadline imposed by Senate procedural rules. A little over an hour later the Senate voted to choke off the first filibuster hurdle on its own version of the funding bill which is the first step toward allowing Democrats to include funding for the health-care law that had previously been stripped out by the House.Both houses of Congress must reach agreement on funding legislation by Monday night to avoid most federal agencies closing on Tuesday.( Read a transcript of Cruz’s remarks on Tuesday. )Meanwhile a similarly contentious debate is simmering over raising the federal debt ceiling with Treasury Secretary Jack Lew warning Wednesday that the nation will exhaust its emergency borrowing capacity no later than Oct. 17.Despite urging from some of his colleagues not to stage the talkathon Cruz took the floor Tuesday afternoon promising to speak against the health-care law “until I am no longer able to stand.”To most Americans it looked like a traditional filibuster fixed in the popular imagination by Jimmy Stewart’s performance in “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.” But parliamentary procedures already in place meant that Cruz eventually would have to yield the floor.Cruz’s controversial strategy shrank the window available for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) and his colleagues to respond with a different version of the legislation.(INTERACTIVE: Longest filibusters of all time )By 5 a.m. the length of Cruz’s marathon discourse had surpassed lengthy filibusters by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) in March and the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) in 1964. He earned a lead spot on all three network morning news shows acknowledging that he was “a little bit” tired but still looking remarkably fresh. The television anchors dubbed Cruz’s effort a “talkathon” even as they explained to viewers that his effort would not derail the legislative process.The senator still wearing the dark suit and light blue tie he had donned the previous day kept his composure throughout his marathon presentation.The Cruz talkathon was the latest example of the increasingly stark division among Republicans both on Capitol Hill and nationally. The Texas newcomer just 42 and nine months into his first term in office is carrying the banner for conservatives who urge a take-no-prisoners approach in confronting the president even if it means shuttering the government.But the move angered senior Republicans who complained that Cruz and the other junior senators pushing this strategy did not understand the wounds the GOP suffered during the mid-1990s shutdown battles with President Bill Clinton. Back then the party controlled both the House and Senate a luxury compared with its tenuous majority in the House today.“I just don’t believe anybody benefits from shutting the government down and certainly Republicans don’t. We learned that in 1995” said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (Utah) the dean of the GOP caucus. “We’re in the minority. We have to find a way of standing up for our principles without immolating ourselves in front of everybody in a way when we don’t have the votes to do it.”Some suggested that the clashing approaches were the latest evidence of a party adrift both on policy and strategic thinking. “We haven’t had much of a strategy on anything to this point. Everybody’s shooting from the hip” said Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.).Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) originally preferred a different approach that would have required Democrats to vote for the health-care funds while GOP senators could have symbolically opposed.Cruz played a leading role along with outside conservative groups in pushing House Republicans to take a harder line. House Republicans on Friday passed a bill without funding for Obamacare exactly as Cruz wanted.McConnell had hoped that he could get Cruz and his band of allies to relent so that the Senate could pass something by Friday. He even convened an extra meeting in addition to the weekly Tuesday policy luncheon at which several senators said Cruz was urged to drop some of his delaying tactics so that Boehner could get the legislation before late Sunday or early Monday.But Cruz would not budge.“We don’t need fake fights. We don’t need fake votes. We need real change. We need a better economy. We need more jobs” Cruz said early Tuesday afternoon rejecting the original Boehner-McConnell plan.All through the night and well into the morning Cruz’s oratory touched on a broad mix of subjects and sources including lyrics from a song by country music star Toby Keith; quotations from the popular reality television show “Duck Dynasty;” recollections of how his father Rafael Cruz used to make green eggs and ham for breakfast; and a recent acceptance speech by actor Ashton Kutcher at an awards show.At one point Tuesday night Cruz opted to read bedtime stories to his two young daughters who he said were home in Texas watching television with his wife. Cruz first read King Solomon’s Wise Words from the Book of Proverbs and then the Dr. Seuss classic “Green Eggs and Ham” which he said was one of his favorite children’s books.Several times Cruz read supportive messages sent to his office via Twitter.Cruz was permitted to yield to colleagues for long-form questions but could not leave the floor or sit while his effort was under way.Several like-minded Senate conservatives took turns giving him respite Tuesday evening including Paul and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) two 2016 presidential aspirants. Rubio returned to the Senate floor Wednesday morning along with Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.).Cruz’s most frequent partner has been Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) who at times phrased “questions” that stretched for almost an hour and included detailed critiques of Supreme Court decisions and a series of recollections from his younger years all designed to draw attention to his concerns about the health-care law.The extended discourse by Cruz and Lee is the culmination of a strategy they began developing in the summer when Lee first elected in 2010 started looking for allies to defund the health-care law by using annual spending bills for federal agencies as potential leverage.Lee and Cruz launched a commercial campaign that targeted fellow Republicans with ads designed to pressure GOP senators to support the pair’s shutdown strategy. Senior colleagues have rejected the approach and instead have grown more angry.A series of junior Democratic senators presided over the Senate chamber through the night as Cruz talked on and on and on. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) passed the time scanning her iPad. Reporters spotted Sen. Chris Murphy (Conn.) returning to the U.S. Capitol shortly before 11 p.m. with a Red Bull in hand.“There’s no point to this other than advancing the career of one or two senators” Murphy said as he wrapped up his two-hour shift around 1 a.m.As dawn neared Cruz began leaning more on the podium at his desk which was surrounded by binders and stacks of paper. In case he ever lost his sense of place a large yellow Post-it note reminded him in blue ink: “Yield only for the purpose of a question. Be careful!”Rosalind Helderman and Jeff Simon contributed to this report.RELATED: 25 leading conservative voices,0
180,People gather outside the state legislature as Senate Republicans gave their final approval to legislation requiring additional rules surrounding abortions in North Carolina even as hundreds of protesters against the bill watched from the gallery in Raleigh N.C. on July 3. (Gerry Broome/AP)As a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly years ago Republican Scott Walker pushed two key measures to limit abortions. Neither was successful.But as governor on Friday Walker signed legislation requiring that women get an ultrasound before having an abortion and mandating that doctors who perform the procedure have admitting privileges at a local hospital. Opponents say the bill would force at least two clinics in Wisconsin to close.The measures are part of a wave of abortion limits passed this year by conservative lawmakers and governors who have approved more than 40 restrictions in statehouses around the country according to data from the Guttmacher Institute which tracks the issue.The push has been aided by the expanded control of state governments by Republicans who now hold a majority of governerships and legislatures and who enjoy veto-proof majorities in twice as many states as Democrats. Some of the measures were also fueled by outrage over the conduct of providers such as Philadelphia late-term abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell who was convicted of murder charges this spring.By mobilizing partisans on both sides the abortion issue is poised to figure more prominently in the 2014 and 2016 elections than most strategists would have expected six months ago.Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) widely seen as a presidential contender is weighing whether to play a leading role on the issue by sponsoring a Senate bill to ban abortions 20 weeks after fertilization. Rubio is attempting to shore up support among conservatives who opposed his role in crafting a Senate immigration bill.In North Carolina the state Senate adopted a sweeping bill Wednesday that includes a ban on sex-selective abortions and on abortion coverage in insurance offered in the state’s health exchange. It also requires abortion clinics be held to the same standards as ambulatory surgical centers and have a transfer agreement with a local hospital.In Texas the legislature convened a second special session this week to take up a bill similar to North Carolina’s which state Sen. Wendy Davis (D) successfully blocked through a filibuster in late June.“It’s not as if there’s some central mastermind strategy that’s organizing action on the state level” said Maureen Ferguson senior policy adviser at the Catholic Association. “It really is a response of the people and the growing pro-life sentiment in the country.”But abortion rights activists and their Democratic allies say the push will work to their political advantage in upcoming congressional and gubernatorial races allowing them to portray Republicans as more focused on extreme social issues than on bolstering the economy. Many of the abortion measures also face court challenges that could delay implementation for months or years.Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Rep. Steve Israel (N.Y.) said in an interview that the DCCC was already targeting 16 House Republicans who had voted in June for the 20-week abortion ban written by Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) or in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood in the last Congress.“Republicans have shown they can’t help themselves from pursuing an ideological agenda and they are further alienating independent and moderate voters” Israel said. “They are pulling themselves down on this issue.”GOP officials say they do not expect abortion to become a decisive factor in upcoming races. Republican candidates will focus instead on economic issues and on controversy surrounding President Obama’s Affordable Care Act they said.“Like most campaigns the issues that are discussed most are the issues that voters deal with on a day-to-day basis” said Brad Dayspring spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. “At the current moment that seems to be jobs the economy making sure health care is affordable and making sure our children have the opportunities we were blessed with.”Abortion is already a major campaign issue in some contests including the Virginia governor’s race between GOP Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II and former Democratic National Committee chairman Terry McAuliffe. But Cuccinelli campaign strategist Chris LaCivita said much of the focus is being driven by one side which has attacked the attorney general for his opposition to abortion even in cases of rape and incest and his push to impose new requirements on abortion clinics.“Ken Cuccinelli’s position on life is well known” LaCivita said. “But the only people trying to make it a central issue are Terry McAuliffe and the Democrats.”Some Republicans however say they are concerned that GOP lawmakers continue to mishandle the issue through clumsy statements that alienate women. During committee consideration of the House abortion bill last month Franks touched off a firestorm when he said that “the incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low.”The following week Rep. Michael C. Burgess (R-Tex.) argued that sonograms suggest a young fetus can experience sexual pleasure. “If they’re a male baby they may have a hand between their legs” Burgess said. “If they feel pleasure why can’t they feel pain?”One Republican Party official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue said the Franks bill “should have been a political win for us and it was a messaging disaster. . . . Salacious inappropriate comments coming out of male House Republicans’ mouths — it just damages the brand.”Abortion opponents who play a crucial role in the Republican base have been pushing particularly hard for legislative action amid revelations about unsafe practices at some abortion clinics. Gosnell was convicted in May of first-degree murder in the deaths of three infants and of involuntary manslaughter in the death of an adult patient. Live Action an anti-abortion group has spurred state investigations of clinics by producing dozens of videos with undercover footage.“House Republicans felt very strongly after the horrors committed by Kermit Gosnell we needed to protect life and protect women and children from these unsafe and inhumane practices” said Rory Cooper spokesman for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.). But he added “Right now we’re focused on energy and jobs.”Public opinion has remained mostly supportive of the right to legal abortion since the 1990s but many Americans are willing to impose tighter restrictions on the procedure. Under the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision abortions can be performed until the point when an individual doctor determines a fetus’s viability which is generally defined as up to 24 weeks of gestation. After that point the government can prohibit the procedure if it provides safeguards for the mother’s health and well-being.Fifty-five percent of respondents said abortion should be legal in all or most cases in an August 2012 Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation poll with 42 percent saying it should be illegal in all or most cases. A Gallup poll in December 2012 found that while 61 percent of respondents supported keeping abortions in the first trimester legal 64 percent thought second-trimester abortions should be illegal and 80 percent backed banning third-trimester abortions.The pace of state abortion restrictions in recent years has accelerated with more than 170 enacted since 2011 according to the Guttmacher Institute.Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser whose group plans to spend $1.5 million helping Cuccinelli said Republicans can win at the ballot box if they “bring the public to a point of consensus” around issues such as a 20-week ban and tougher operating standards for clinics.Democrats are doing their best to put all anti-abortion Republicans in the same camp as Todd Akin whose Senate candidacy for a seat in Missouri collapsed last year after he suggested women don’t get pregnant in instances of “legitimate rape.”Democrats pounced this week after Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) signed several new abortion restrictions into law while surrounded by a group of male legislators. Both the Democratic Governors Association and American Bridge 21st Century a liberal super PAC began highlighting the scene in political attacks.Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols called the criticism unfounded. “The governor is pro-life and we believe these are reasonable policies to help protect human life” he wrote in an e-mail.But Ilyse Hogue president of NARAL Pro-Choice America said Kasich’s move “will be an issue for him” in his reelection campaign next year. “These are going to be nationalized races in a way we haven’t seen with these state races because people understand the things that are at stake” she said.Capital Insight survey research analyst Scott Clement contributed to this report.,0
181,Edward Snowden and the WikiLeaks organization that helped him evade extradition to the United States to face espionage charges praised Russia for having “done the right thing” Thursday in granting temporary asylum to the former National Security Agency contractor.In a statement posted on its website WikiLeaks denounced the Obama administration for its “bellicose response” to the American fugitive’s search for refuge from U.S. prosecution for disclosing top-secret NSA data surveillance operations.“Over the past eight weeks we have seen the Obama administration show no respect for international or domestic law but in the end the law is winning” Snowden is quoted as saying after finally escaping more than a month of diplomatic limbo at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo International Airport. “I thank the Russian Federation for granting me asylum in accordance with its laws and international obligations.”Snowden’s father Lon also expressed his gratitude to Russian President Vladimir Putin for protecting his son from the legal consequences of having violated his NSA confidentiality obligations.AdvertisementIn an interview broadcast Wednesday by Rossiya-24 television the elder Snowden praised Putin and his government for having “the strength and resolve and convictions to protect my son.” Lon Snowden was in the process of arranging a visit to Moscow to see his son the fugitive’s lawyer Anatoly Kucherena told journalists after his client left the airport for an undisclosed location.“Despite the ongoing pressure from the United States which has been trying to interfere with this sovereign [asylum] process in violation of the U.N. Protocol on the Rights of Refugees Russia has done the right thing and granted Mr. Snowden temporary asylum” the unsigned WikiLeaks statement declared.WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange from his own tentative refuge at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London pronounced Snowden’s grant of asylum in Russia a triumph in the global battle to protect those who expose what they consider illegal government behavior.“This is another victory in the fight against Obama’s war on whistle-blowers. This battle has been won but the war continues” Assange said. “The United States can no longer continue the surveillance of world citizens and its digital colonization of sovereign nations.”AdvertisementRussian human rights advocates were quick to point out though that Snowden has taken shelter in a country with a deplorable track record in defense of free speech and tolerance of dissent.Lyudmila Alexeyeva head of the human rights advocates of the Moscow Helsinki Group said it was good that Snowden had finally escaped his protracted ordeal in the transit area of the capital’s main airport but noted that he now finds himself in a country with little regard for the ideals of freedom he professes.“Having fought for the freedom and rights Snowden has ended up in a country that cracks down on them” Alexeyeva was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.Human Rights Watch analysts also took note of the irony of the Kremlin coming to the defense of a self-styled champion of privacy and free speech rights.Advertisement“He cannot but be aware of the unprecedented crackdown on human rights that the government has unleashed in the past 15 months” Rachel Denber the rights group’s expert on Russia and other former Soviet states told the Associated Press by email.Another Human Rights Watch commentator Deputy Executive Director Carroll Bogert advised Snowden in a tongue-in-cheek post on CNN’s news blog that he get familiar with certain expressions in the Russian language such as “khuliganstvo” -- hooliganism which might cover anything from getting in a fistfight to performance of a protest song denouncing Putin.ALSO:Zimbabwe election ends war of words beginsItaly high court upholds Berlusconi conviction sidesteps banAdvertisementBangladesh Islamic party disqualified from election; protests eruptTwitter: @cjwilliamslatcarol.williams@latimes.com,1

183,"Dear President ObamaI am Ju Hong the ""heckler"" that interrupted your speech at the Betty Ong Center in San Francisco last week. I spoke up not out of disrespect however either for you or our country. No I spoke up -- and am writing to you now -- to ask that you use your executive order to halt deportations for 11.5 million undocumented immigrant families.My family came to the United States from South Korea when I was 11 years old. Like many immigrants my mother brought me to this country to seek a better life for her children.I graduated from UC Berkeley and am now pursuing a Master's degree in Public Administration at San Francisco State University. I have lived in America now for 13 years. I consider this country as my home. During my senior year in high school however I learned that my family had overstayed a tourist visa. We are undocumented immigrants.As an American without papers I was not able to get a job obtain a driver's license or receive governmental financial aid. When my mother was sick and in severe pain she did not visit a doctor because she cannot procure medical insurance. And when my family's home was burglarized she refused to call the police because she was afraid that our family would be turned over to immigration officials and deported.Like many other undocumented immigrants I was living in the shadows and living in fear of deportation. However I have decided to speak out and stand up.Immigration reform is not only a Latino issue it's also an Asian and Pacific Islander issue -- in fact it is a human rights issue. Currently two million of the estimated 11.5 million undocumented immigrants in our country come from Asia. Under your administration 250000 undocumented Asian/Pacific Islander immigrants have been deported. While we only make up five percent of the country we are disproportionately impacted by your immigration policies.Last week I was formally invited by White House staff to hear your remarks on immigration reform in San Francisco. As I stood in the stands behind you I was hoping to hear about your plan to address the lives of 11 million undocumented people living in this country like my family. And while you expressed your support for comprehensive immigration reform you did not address how an average of 1100 immigrants are deported every single day under your administration. You did not address how you deported 205000 parents of U.S. citizens in the last two years. You did not address how because of your administration's record number of deportations--nearly two million immigrants in five years a record--families are being torn apart: spouses are being separated from each other parents are being separated from their children and our brothers and sisters are being separated from one another. You did not to address how your administration would end the anti-immigration deportation programs like ""Secure Communities."" You've deported more people than any other president in the U.S. history.Interestingly you talked about Angel Island during your speech. What you did not mention however is that more people are detained every single day in detention today than were detained yearly at Angel Island. You recognized Angel Island as a dark period in Chinatown's history but you failed to recognize that more Asians and Pacific Islanders are in detention today than were in detention under the Chinese Exclusion Act. In fact your administration detains up to 34000 people per day a record number of detainees in U.S. history.Because you failed to address these issues I was compelled to address the concerns of our community.You claim that the President of the United States has no authority to stop the deportations. And yet in June 2012 before the 2012 election which you won with the help of Latino and Asian voters you implemented Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. With the stroke of a pen you dramatically changed the lives of hundreds of thousands of young people like me who can now live without the daily threat of deportation and can legally work in this country for the first time in our lives.I know that you support comprehensive immigration reform. But I also know that you have the power to stop the deportations and that you have the power to stop the suffering fear and intimidation facing millions of immigrants like my family.Your fellow AmericanJu Hong",1

186,"RICHMOND Va. (AP) — It was the kickoff of a ""Stop Amnesty Tour"" organized by the Tea Party Patriots and other groups. But the crowd was so sparse that immigrant advocates were soon gleefully circulating photos of the featured speaker Republican Rep. Steve King of Iowa standing alone on an empty stage.The rally at a public park in Richmond Va. earlier this month along with the subsequent cancellation or postponement of several similar events points to an emerging reality during Congress' five-week summer recess: Opposition to overhauling immigration laws appears notably muted almost tame. Meanwhile advocates who support comprehensive overhaul legislation are claiming they've changed at least a handful of minds among House Republicans.During Congress' last attempt to remake the immigration system in 2007 public backlash helped kill the bill as angry calls overwhelmed the Senate switchboard. This summer other issues notably President Barack Obama's health care law seem to be topping the list of voters' concerns.Constituents opposed to citizenship for immigrants in this country illegally are loudly voicing their views at Republican House members' town hall meetings this month. But advocates of immigration legislation that offers a path to citizenship are having some success getting their supporters to show up too even in heavily Republican districts.""In a sort of immediate sense Obamacare is what the party has decided they want to make a big deal of in these town halls so that's frankly siphoning off a lot of outrage because the people ticked off about Obamacare are the same people ticked off about amnesty"" said Mark Krikorian executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies which opposes higher immigration levels.Plus the pro-immigration reform side is better organized and funded this time around and many establishment Republicans are on board. ""All of that put together means you're not going to see the same level of frantic activity"" Krikorian said.Story continuesWhat's less clear is how much it will matter once lawmakers return to Washington in September.Immigration overhaul legislation a top second-term priority for Obama is in limbo after the Democratic-led Senate in June passed a far-reaching bill that includes tens of billions of dollars for border security new visa programs to bring more high- and low-skilled workers to the country requirements for employers to check all workers' legal status and a 13-year path to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants already in the country illegally.GOP House leaders have rejected that approach vowing instead to proceed with bills addressing individual immigration issues beginning with border security. And although by advocates' count more than 20 House Republicans have now declared their support for some kind of citizenship path the majority of House Republicans remain opposed creating a potentially unbridgeable divide between the House and the Senate. Congress also faces looming deadlines on the debt ceiling and spending bills to keep the government running. It all adds up to a tough environment for getting an immigration bill to Obama's desk.Nonetheless pro-immigrant advocates are claiming success in their August recess efforts to pressure House Republicans to act on immigration in the fall. An unusual and deep-pocketed alliance of Catholics and evangelicals labor unions business groups and others have been targeting dozens of GOP members viewed as open to hearing them out and say they'll have momentum on their side when Congress reconvenes.""The big story I think of the August recess is that we haven't seen what some had predicted this major anti-immigrant movement where members of Congress would be heckled into inaction"" Galen Carey vice president of government relations at the National Association of Evangelicals said on a media call this week to announce a $400000 14-state radio ad campaign in support of immigration reform. ""We've seen very much that that has been a muted voice but actually the pro-immigrant voice has been rather prominent at many of the town halls that we have observed.""Although there have been no giant public rallies to draw national attention pro-immigrant advocates have kept up a drumbeat of activity nationwide. They sent some 1500 supporters into House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy's Bakersfield Calif. district last week; delivered a 10000-signature petition to Rep. Blake Farenthold R-Texas; and launched a statewide tour through Wisconsin among other activities.They're pointing to comments in the past few weeks from a handful of House Republicans including Reps. Daniel Webster of Florida Aaron Schock of Illinois and Dave Reichert of Washington indicating qualified support for eventual citizenship for immigrants here illegally. So far though such comments have not become too widespread and it's uncertain they'll add up to a real impetus for action in the fall.But immigrant activists who'd been concerned that this summer could be a repeat of the last immigration fight — or of 2009 when irate voters trashed Obama's health care bill at unruly town hall meetings across the country — are starting to breathe easy.The Stop Amnesty Tour event Aug. 12 in Richmond was to have been followed by events in other states several of which subsequently disappeared from the Tea Party Patriots' website according to an archived version circulated by the pro-immigrant group America's Voice. Organizers said most were going forward or rescheduled and disputed the claim by America's Voice that events were being canceled due to lack of interest.""I think that when I heard about what happened at the Richmond event we just look at what can we do to improve going forward and one thing would be to give people more than 72 hours' notice"" said Jenny Beth Martin co-founder of Tea Party Patriots. The group is working on the events with others including NumbersUSA which advocates lower immigration levels.The Black American Leadership Alliance which opposes allowing more immigrants into the country to compete for jobs canceled a series of rallies according to cached copies of Facebook postings collected by America's Voice. But Leah Durant the group's founder said those events were being held by local groups and the Black American Leadership Alliance was just trying to help support them.""When I look at the focus of what's going on I wouldn't say that there's no enthusiasm"" Durant said. ""I hear from people every day who say they are very concerned about this.""",0

189,"Story highlights David Rothkopf: Kerry Clinton collaborated (accidentally?) to add hopeful twist on Syria In a ""goof"" Kerry said Syria yielding chemical weapons might avert U.S. strike Rothkopf says Potential presidential candidate Clinton called it ""important step"" and showed her influence Rothkopf: Even if plan fails it gives Obama cover for trying diplomacyEditor’s Note: David Rothkopf writes regularly for CNN.com. He is CEO and editor-at-large of the FP Group publishers of Foreign Policy magazine and a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Follow him on Twitter.(CNN) —On Monday President Barack Obama’s two secretaries of state inadvertently collaborated with Russia’s foreign minister to shape a twist in the Syria debate that a day later is looking more and more like a possible way out of the current crisis.It took an idea from being an off-the-cuff throwaway line through being an informal proposal to the point today where it will be proposed for consideration by the United Nations. Perhaps more importantly for the President it may help save him from a political showdown in Congress where it seems increasingly likely he cannot win while adding a glimmer of hope to a story that for two weeks has been an unrelenting mess for the White House and of deep concern to the American people.The first move came from the current secretary of state John Kerry. In a statement that was initially seen as a slip of the tongue (probably because it was) Kerry raised the possibility that if Syria were to give up its chemical weapons an attack might be avoided. Although the administration almost immediately backed away from the statement and the British foreign secretary characterized it as impossible the idea quickly began to gain traction.David RothkopfSyrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem announced that his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov had proposed that Syria’s chemical weapons be put under some form of international control as a way of forestalling a U.S.-led attack. Moallem went further welcoming the initiative.It turned out Kerry had spoken to Lavrov. And while Washington’s first response was natural skepticism given the misrepresentations of the Syrian government in the past it became clear that if there was any chance such an initiative could spare the president the political debacle of a failed vote in the Congress – and possibly spare the country the costs of another military intervention in the region – some in the administration felt it was worth considering.So hours after a senior official had told CNN the Kerry statement was a “major goof” the press office in the White House was claiming credit suggesting that the “credible threat” of a U.S. plan had triggered the diplomatic opening.Next up former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who had already been teed up to offer a statement of support for her former boss/potential predecessor made a brief statement that had to have been carefully cleared with the White House.She called the idea that Syria might give up its chemical weapons an “important step” if the Russians and the Syrians actively followed up on it. This was yet another sign that the administration was hoping that the morning’s seeming misstep yield an opportunity to step away from a congressional showdown or at least buy some breathing room.Further while Clinton did not address the specifics of Obama’s proposed Syria intervention she did say that she would support him.Up until now her silence on the issue was seen by some as an effort by the likely presidential candidate to distance herself from the Obama team’s muddled handling of the proposed Syria intervention. But Monday’s message not only showed her political loyalty to the president but it also emphasized the outsized influence of her views in America and around the globe.In the wake of her remarks there were initially reports that other nations such as France would welcome giving the Russian initiative a chance. The President framed it as a “potentially positive development.” Then on Tuesday the Syrian government formally accepted the Russian proposal. The U.S. and France took the plan to the United Nations to give it the formal backing and oversight of that institution. It is still clearly a long way from being realized but there is momentum.Nonetheless even should it blow up appearing to consider it allows Obama to be able to say he had exhausted all diplomatic options to resolve the problem. And for the more the hawkishly inclined it would also be seen as reminder that military pressure is often key to producing peaceful political outcomes.Either way for a moment an idea that might ultimately seem to be in the interest of Obama Russian President Vladimir Putin Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and arguably the Syrian Opposition (to the extent they no longer might face chemical weapons) gained surprising traction. This was thanks in part to the seeming misstep of America’s current top diplomat to his swift interaction with his Russian counterpart and the added weight his predecessor’s views brought to the matter.It is a long-shot proposal started perhaps by accident promoted by parties who have regularly lied and cautiously embraced by a U.S. administration whose policies in Syria have been incoherent by any measure. Regardless of whether it amounts to anything or not it speaks volumes about how bad our options are.Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Rothkopf.",0
190,"The death toll given by the Obama administration for an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack is far higher than confirmed counts of two key allies and a main activist group which said it was shocked by the U.S. figure.In pressing Congress to authorize a military strike against Syria the administration has asserted that the government of President Bashar Assad killed 1429 people including at least 426 children in an Aug. 21 attack on the suburbs of Damascus.But Britain and France have cited far lower numbers of confirmed deaths raising questions about the intelligence the White House is using to make its case to launch missile strikes against Syria.U.S. officials say they can’t disclose how they derived their figure without compromising intelligence but they say it is based on a variety of sources and they stand by it.AdvertisementBritish intelligence organizations said last week that they believed at least 350 people had been killed. French intelligence said Monday that it had confirmed at least 281 deaths through open-source videos although its experts had created models that were consistent with as many as 1500 deaths.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights generally regarded as one of the most reliable sources of information on casualty figures in Syria says it has confirmed 502 deaths including 80 children and 137 women. Rami Abdul-Rahman a Syrian expatriate who runs the organization from his home in Britain said he was shocked by the White House’s count.“I don’t know where this number came from” Abdul-Rahman said in a phone interview.He said some Syrian opposition groups disseminate propaganda and exaggerated death tolls in an attempt to sway American politicians.Advertisement“The U.S. took this high number from one part of the Syrian opposition that is supported by the U.S. government” Abdul-Rahman said. “We don’t trust them.”U.S. intelligence officials said they didn’t base their assessment on reports from any single opposition group.Adding to the confusion a day after Secretary of State John F. Kerry said that “the United States government now knows that at least 1429 Syrians were killed in this attack” President Obama on Saturday only referred to “well over 1000"" fatalities.Kerry didn’t cite any casualty figures in his testimony Tuesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. And according to an official familiar with a formal intelligence assessment sent to Congress the document did not include those figures.AdvertisementThe casualty figures are important because the administration is resting its case for military action in part on the scale of the attack. A senior administration official said a previous use of chemical weapons by Assad’s military caused “100 to 150"" casualties which prompted the Obama administration to offer lethal aid to Syrian rebels but not to contemplate direct military action.“This is a much larger scale of use” the official said Friday. “It’s indiscriminate.”U.S. intelligence officials said Tuesday that foreign intelligence agencies use different methods and resources and often arrive at different casualty counts. A British official in Washington said the British estimate was lower because it was released a few days before the American one.Shawn Turner a spokesman for the U.S. director of national intelligence said “The information that led to our understanding of the scale of the attack came from a number of sources including international and Syrian medical personnel videos witness accounts and social media reports.Advertisement“We’ve said from the beginning that our estimates were preliminary and that we expect to update the number as we obtain more information” he said.A senior administration official who would not be quoted by name discussing classified intelligence said that Obama was not signaling any retreat from the higher figure and that officials believed the death toll could even go beyond 1429.A second official said “The president has no intelligence reason to walk back from that number.”The precision of the U.S. figure given the initial confusion surrounding the attack and the often contradictory reports of the violence in Syria also raised questions among some observers.AdvertisementAnthony Cordesman an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies wrote Monday that the U.S. estimate was “absurdly over-precise” and that Obama’s language created “a mix of contradictions over the most basic facts.”Syria’s political and military opposition is severely fragmented. The U.S. figure more closely matches reports by pro-opposition organizations such as the Local Coordination Committees and the United Revolutionary Medical Office in eastern Ghouta a Damascus suburb hit by the alleged chemical attack.The latter group said it had documented at least 1302 deaths about two-thirds of which were women and children. That figure was cited by the U.S.-based Syrian Support Group which has a federal license to funnel aid to Syrian rebels.--Advertisementken.dilanian@latimes.comshashank.bengali@latimes.com",1

192,As a precondition for “peace” talks with the Palestinians that will produce nothing President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry demanded that Israel’s government release over 100 long-term convicted terrorists and murderers many imprisoned for vicious crimes committed long before either intifada.The “Elder of Ziyon” blog has compiled a list of those to be released–and their victims. Here is a sample:Atiyeh Salem Musa: killed Isaac (Aizek) Rotenberg 67 Holocaust survivor 1994 Isaac Rotenberg was born to Natan and Miriam Rotenberg in Poland on 15 March 1927. A selektzia was held in his city following the outbreak of the Second World War and his family was sent to the Sobibór extermination camp. With the exception of him his younger brother and his sister his entire family perished. He was taken with his brother to a labor camp. When a revolt broke out the two succeeded in escaping the camp but they lost track of each other in the ensuing commotion. Isaac then made his way to the forest and joined the partisans. In April 1947 Isaac reached the Land of Israel. He joined the IDF the next year and fought in the War of Liberation in the north near Kibbutz Manara. Isaac was married to Riva and they had two children Tzipora and Pinhas. He worked as a plasterer and was a founder of the city of Holon. Upon reaching retirement age he decided to continue working a few hours per day to keep himself busy. On 29 March 1994 during the Passover holiday as Isaac was hunched on his knees fixing a floor in his workplace in Petah Tikva two of the Arab laborers on site attacked him and struck the back of his neck with axes. He was critically wounded and entered a coma. Two days later on 31 March he died.Hosni Faregh Sawalha–murder of Baruch Heisler 24 1990 On 2 December 1990 Yaacov missed his ride to his yeshiva [religious seminary] and instead boarded bus 66 from Petah Tikva to Tel Aviv. Three Arab terrorists boarded at the Pardes Katz stop and immediately thereafter at the junction of Ben Gurion Road and Jabotinsky Road in Ramat Gan began stabbing passengers. Baruch Yaacov was murdered; three others were injured.Esmat Omar Mansour–accessory to murder of Haim Mizrahi 1993 Hayim Mizrahi was born to Mazal and Pinhas Mizrahi on 8 December 1963. He grew up in Bat Yam and Holon with his sisters Margalit and Asnat and his brother Itzik. As a child Hayim belonged to the junior league soccer team of Hapoel Tel Aviv. Following is army service he became religious moved to Beit El and married Iris. On Friday 29 October 1993 Hayim went to buy eggs from an Arab-owned farm near his home as he was wont to do. He was greeted by terrorists who attacked him and fled in his vehicle after wounding him and stuffing him into the trunk. The terrorists proceeded to murder Hayim then burned and abandoned the vehicle north of Ramallah. Hayim was 30 at the time of his death. He was put to rest in Holon Cemetery. Hayim was survived by his pregnant wife his parents his sisters and his brother. Half-a-year after his murder his daughter Tehilla was born.Obama and Kerry insisted on the release of the terrorists and murderers and Israel–fearful of losing U.S. support at the UN and against Iran–complied. That is the heavy price demanded by an administration that prides itself as tough on terrorists–while arming them and Syria and releasing them in Israel.Image: Family of Moshe Becker citrus grower murdered; Elder of Ziyon blog,1

That appears to be as much the case in Indonesia as it is in the United States.Daming Sanusi a candidate for the Indonesian Supreme Court has fueled outrage in the predominantly Muslim country by suggesting that rape victims enjoy being violated.Read more: ‘Mother Robin’ delivers for poor women in IndonesiaHe made the comments Monday in front of a parliamentary commission hearing to determine if he was a fit for the top court according to the official Indonesian news agency Antara.In response to a question about whether the death penalty should be applied in rape cases Daming reportedly said “Consideration needs to be taken thoroughly for the imposition of death penalty for a rapist because in a rape case both the rapist and the victim enjoy it.”News of his comments quickly spread on social media prompting anger disgust and calls for Daming’s candidature for the Supreme Court to be shot down.CNN iReport: Women of Indonesia“We ask legislators not to give the judge position to Daming as he had offended people`s feeling by uttering inappropriate statement” Ridwan Bakar a spokesman for the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation said Tuesday.As the furor grew Daming issued an apology acknowledging that his words were “out of control.”In a news conference he said that he was nervous in the session in front of the lawmakers and made the comment as a joke.“I made the remark without realizing it can harm people’s feeling” Antara cited him as saying.Damage is doneBut his contrition appeared to be too little too late.“The damage has been done” Primastuti Handayani the managing editor of the Jakarta Post wrote in a commentary published Wednesday. “Nothing he said in his apology can heal the wound he caused.”She also noted that Daming is not the first Indonesian official to make controversial comments about rape highlighting the case last year of Jakarta Governor Fauzi Bowo who said women should avoid wearing miniskirts on public transport to avoid “any unwanted consequences.”Indonesian political figures began to distance themselves from Daming amid the outrage this week and his chances of being selected as a Supreme Court justice seemed to wither.Opinion: Why have men lost touch with reality over rape?The chairman of the parliamentary commission Gede Pasek Suardika said that Daming’s remarks were inappropriate and that the public outcry against him would be taken into consideration. Members of the commission from the Prosperous Justice Party recommended against selecting him.The controversy that sprung up around Daming mirrors outrage in the United States over remarks about rape made by Republicans Richard Mourdock and Todd Akin.Once leading in the polls Mourdock and Akin both lost their Senate races to Democrats in November after their comments on pregnancy and rape were widely circulated.Read more: Divorce by text message sparks bizarre legal battle in IndonesiaWhen asked on a local news show what he thought about abortion in the case of rape Akin set off the controversy when he said “First of all from what I understand from doctors that’s really rare.

Phil Gingrey Republican of Georgia revived the furor last week when he commented on the cases of Mourdock and Akin and reportedly suggested Akin was “partly right.”Gingrey later said his words reported by the Marietta Daily-Journal had been misconstrued.Opinion: End culture of rape in 2013",0
195,Just as the Affordable Care Act was the signature piece of legislation of President Obama’s first term the top achievement of term two is supposed to be immigration reform. And for a while with Republicans freaked out by the ground they have lost among Latino voters such legislation looked unstoppable. But now not so much.On Friday the Republican National Committee passed a resolution calling on Congress to pass immigration reform but the version of reform they want provides only renewable work permits not a path to citizenship for undocumented residents of the U.S.That is not what Obama and the Democrats have called for nor what Republican Sens. Marco Rubio and John McCain have been pushing nor what was hammered out in a Senate bill by the bipartisan “Gang of Eight.”All of them see a path to citizenship as a crucial element in the legislation. But the RNC’s position reflects the view of many Republicans including many members of the House GOP that no one should be rewarded for sneaking into the country even if they happened to be babies when they were sneaked in and have now grown up to go to college or serve in the military.AdvertisementDemocrats and pro-reform Republicans such as McCain and Rubio hoped to soften the hard line against offering citizenship by promising that border security would be beefed up even more than it has been. This is despite plenty of evidence that one big reason so many undocumented people have taken up residence in the United States is because crossing the border with Mexico has become so difficult and perilous. Where once Mexican citizens came and went with the rhythm of seasonal work now they stay because the border has been militarized.Nevertheless despite the possibility that more rigid border controls may actually be keeping Mexican nationals on this side of the border and despite the fact that illegal entries are at a 40-year low -- partly because of increased security but even more because of demographic and economic changes in Mexico -- many Republicans insist that many more millions of tax dollars need to be spent on a problem that is largely resolved.They get their wish in the current immigration legislation yet they show no inclination to reciprocate by giving an inch on citizenship -- even for the kids who grew up here and have no other country they want to call their own.Since the rise of tea party politicians in 2010 and the election of many of their kind to Congress the inflexible and sometimes irrational opposition of these right-wing absolutists has stymied sensible bipartisan legislation that could help fix a broad array of problems from creating jobs to building roads and bridges. Thanks to them immigration reform may be the next good idea that goes nowhere.,0

So it's not like this is a stretch for me"" he said.Valadao said the slow pace of immigration legislation in the House also contributed to his decision.""This isn't really a shot at leadership but more 'Guys this is important to me we have to move and we have to be part of this solution'"" he said. ""It doesn't matter how conservative of a district you come from - we have a system that we need to fix.""Valado's decision to join Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen R-Fla. and Jeff Denham R-Calif. in co-sponsoring the bill comes at a critical time for immigration reform in Congress.There are 231 Republicans in the House and the GOP leadership has overseen hearings on separate bills tackling individual immigration issues. It has not favored a single bill to handle all issues.A bill needs 218 votes to pass the House and the Democratic bill has 186 Democratic co-sponsors. Adding three GOP votes still falls well short of a majority for passage.The Senate passed a sweeping overhaul to the nation's immigration laws in June that provides a pathway to citizenship for the country's undocumented immigrants doubles the size of the Border Patrol and revamps the legal immigration system to bring in more high-tech and low-skilled workers.But even Sen. Marco Rubio R-Fla. one of the architects of that bill has questioned whether that bill is the best way forward. Rubio said Rubio's spokesman Alex Conant said the ""all or nothing"" approach they took in the Senate ""would result in nothing.""Rubio and House Republican leaders say they would rather move forward with the ""piecemeal"" approach in which Congress considers smaller bills that tackle individual pieces of the nation's immigration laws.House committees have approved a handful of bills that address border security grant immigration enforcement powers to local and state police officers increase the number of visas for high-tech workers and require U.S. businesses to check the immigration status of new hires.House Speaker John Boehner R-Ohio has said he is ""hopeful"" that immigration could be voted on by the full House before the end of the year but he has given no timetable.""These guys signing on (to the Democratic bill) are kind of like people left standing when the music stops in musical chairs"" said Mark Krikorian executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies which opposes the Senate immigration bill. ""Just as the prospects of a bill passing are declining these people are signing on.""Supporters of the Democratic bill see something else happening.Frank Sharry executive director of America's Voice a group that supports the Senate immigration bill said the increasing support of the Democratic bill puts more pressure on GOP leaders to get moving on immigration.""Does it mean that this bill is going to be brought up sometime soon? Probably not"" Sharry said. ""But does it ratchet up the pressure on house leadership to get something going? Yeah. It'll make it harder for House leadership to slow-walk this thing to death.""The bill H.R. 15 is sponsored by Rep. Joe Garcia R-Fla. It is mostly a replica of the Senate's immigration bill but it eliminates the $46 billion border security plan adopted in the Senate and replaces it with a border security plan authored by Rep. Michael McCaul R-Texas and was approved unanimously by the House Homeland Security Committee.Garcia said he was encouraged by the latest addition to his bill and said he's pushing to bring more on board. He hopes it will reach a point where House leadership is forced to bring it to the floor where it could pass with most Democrats and a couple-dozen Republicans similar to the vote that ended the government shutdown.""The same way we found votes on the budget I think Speaker Boehner will see the votes here"" Garcia said.",0
197,Just as the Affordable Care Act was the signature piece of legislation of President Obama’s first term the top achievement of term two is supposed to be immigration reform. And for a while with Republicans freaked out by the ground they have lost among Latino voters such legislation looked unstoppable. But now not so much.On Friday the Republican National Committee passed a resolution calling on Congress to pass immigration reform but the version of reform they want provides only renewable work permits not a path to citizenship for undocumented residents of the U.S.That is not what Obama and the Democrats have called for nor what Republican Sens. Marco Rubio and John McCain have been pushing nor what was hammered out in a Senate bill by the bipartisan “Gang of Eight.”All of them see a path to citizenship as a crucial element in the legislation. But the RNC’s position reflects the view of many Republicans including many members of the House GOP that no one should be rewarded for sneaking into the country even if they happened to be babies when they were sneaked in and have now grown up to go to college or serve in the military.AdvertisementDemocrats and pro-reform Republicans such as McCain and Rubio hoped to soften the hard line against offering citizenship by promising that border security would be beefed up even more than it has been. This is despite plenty of evidence that one big reason so many undocumented people have taken up residence in the United States is because crossing the border with Mexico has become so difficult and perilous. Where once Mexican citizens came and went with the rhythm of seasonal work now they stay because the border has been militarized.Nevertheless despite the possibility that more rigid border controls may actually be keeping Mexican nationals on this side of the border and despite the fact that illegal entries are at a 40-year low -- partly because of increased security but even more because of demographic and economic changes in Mexico -- many Republicans insist that many more millions of tax dollars need to be spent on a problem that is largely resolved.They get their wish in the current immigration legislation yet they show no inclination to reciprocate by giving an inch on citizenship -- even for the kids who grew up here and have no other country they want to call their own.Since the rise of tea party politicians in 2010 and the election of many of their kind to Congress the inflexible and sometimes irrational opposition of these right-wing absolutists has stymied sensible bipartisan legislation that could help fix a broad array of problems from creating jobs to building roads and bridges. Thanks to them immigration reform may be the next good idea that goes nowhere.,0
198,During the Bush Administration mainstream media outlets hammered President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney for their “rendition” policy that allowed suspected terrorists to be detained overseas in foreign countries and interrogated at the direction of the US government. Hollywood even made a movie about it so you know it was important.Along with Guantanamo Bay rendition was cited as an example of the un-constitutional Bush/Cheney dictatorship running rough-shod on the Geneva Conventions and basic human rights.As a candidate Barack Obama indicated that he would reverse the policy in an article in Foreign Affairs.To build a better freer world we must first behave in ways that reflect the decency and aspirations of the American people… This means ending the practices of shipping away prisoners in the dead of night to be tortured in far-off countries of detaining thousands without charge or trial of maintaining a network of secret prisons to jail people beyond the reach of the law.Two days into his presidency Obama quietly continued the evil rendition policy and it has continued ever since. Last week it was revealed that three new detainees were taken prisoner in the small African country of Djibouti and interrogated by American agents:U.S. agents accused the men — two of them Swedes the other a longtime resident of Britain — of supporting al-Shabab an Islamist militia in Somalia that Washington considers a terrorist group. Two months after their arrest the prisoners were secretly indicted by a federal grand jury in New York then clandestinely taken into custody by the FBI and flown to the United States to face trial. The secret arrests and detentions came to light Dec. 21 when the suspects made a brief appearance in a Brooklyn courtroom.Other than a small handful of news reports the continuing rendition has received little or no attention and absolutely no condemnation from opinion writers who were hysterical over the Bush-era policies.They could be criticizing Obama over his rendition policy or they could be hammering him over his hypocrisy. They could be… if they were interested in truly speaking truth to power. But President Obama is their guy so rendition is just fine under his watch.,1
199,"Faced with an unusually harsh rebuke from a federal judge the White House on Tuesday cautiously defended the force-feeding of Guantanamo Bay prisoners stressing “We don’t want these individuals to die.”Press secretary Jay Carney’s comments came after U.S. District Court Judge Gladys Kessler urged Obama to personally address the controversy over the hunger strike at the notorious facility. Kessler dismissed a suit from a Guantanamo detainee who argued that the government will infringe upon his religious freedom by force-feeding him during the Muslim holiday of Ramadan which begins Tuesday but called the practice “painful humiliating and degrading"" and pressed the president to act.Asked about Kessler's comments Carney told reporters at his daily briefing ""On the questions of litigation I would refer you to the Department of Justice and the Defense Department which obviously runs Guantanamo Bay I would refer you to them for specifics about the hunger strikers.""But ""we don’t want these individuals to die. And you know the action being taken is to prevent that from happening"" he underlined. Obama ""understands that this is a challenging situation.""Jihad Dhiab a Syrian detainee who was cleared for release by the Guantanamo Review Task Force in 2009 but has remained imprisoned sued with three other detainees over the military's policy of forcibly feeding detainees who are on hunger strike and lose a certain amount of their body weight.Dhiab claimed that the forced feeding would violate his religious freedom during the month of Ramadan when devotees are supposed to fast until sundown each day. It is the U.S military and prisons policy not to allow prisoners to starve themselves but the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights the World Medical Association and other groups have said the practice is inhumane and that people should have the right to starve themselves in protest. Dhiab is one of 45 Guantanamo prisoners on a force-feed list with a total of 106 captives on hunger strike. Only 60 of the 166 Guantanamo prisoners are not currently on hunger strike.Carney reiterated Obama's wish to close the facility.Liz Goodwin contributed to this report.",1
200,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Struggling to salvage a massive surveillance program President Barack Obama faced congressional critics of the National Security Agency's collection of Americans' telephone records Thursday as snowballing concerns made new limitations on the intelligence effort appear increasingly likely.Obama and Vice President Joe Biden joined lawmakers on both sides of the issue for an Oval Office meeting designed to stem the bleeding of public support and show Obama was serious about engaging. Among the participants were the NSA's most vigorous congressional supporters — the top Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate intelligence panels — alongside its most stern critics including Democratic Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Mark Udall of Colorado.The lawmakers departed the rainy White House grounds without speaking to reporters. But in interviews later they said there was a consensus that the surveillance efforts are suffering from perception problems that have undercut trust among the American people.""There is openness to making changes"" said Rep. C.A. ""Dutch"" Ruppersberger of Maryland the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia top Republican on the Senate's intelligence panel and a strong NSA defender said Obama and the lawmakers didn't agree to take specific steps but brought up a number of proposals that will be fleshed out over the August congressional recess.""A lot of ideas were thrown out"" Chambliss told The Associated Press. ""Nothing was concluded.""Wyden in an interview said he and Udall had sought to convince Obama of the urgency of addressing rising concerns. He said he proposed strengthening the government's ability to get emergency authorization to collect an individual's phone records so that pre-emptive collection of everyone's records would no longer be necessary.""I felt that the president was open to ideas — and we're going to make sure he has some"" Wyden said after returning to Capitol Hill.Story continuesWyden and two Senate colleagues also unveiled legislation Thursday to overhaul the secret federal court that oversees the programs which critics decry as largely a rubber stamp. The senators aim to make the court created under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act or FISA more adversarial by creating a special advocate who could argue for privacy during closed-door proceedings and appeal decisions. A companion bill would diversify the court's bench by ending the chief justice's sole authority to pick its judges.""These bills do not compromise national security but they put a necessary opposing view in the FISA court and assure ideological diversity of judges"" said Sen. Tom Udall D-N.M. Another of the bill's sponsors Sen. Richard Blumenthal D-Conn. said the Obama administration was receptive to the ideas although White House officials declined to comment.Debate over the line between counterterrorism and invasion of privacy has been heating up since former government contract systems analyst Edward Snowden leaked classified documents exposing the NSA's monumental capability to sweep up data about phone and Internet use including programs that store years of phone records on virtually every American. Snowden's revelations have prompted a national rethinking over government surveillance powers that have grown since the Sept. 11 2001 terrorist attacks.Russia decided on Thursday to grant temporary asylum to Snowden who has been in a Moscow airport hotel for more than a month despite America's insistence that the fugitive be sent home to face prosecution on espionage charges.In Washington House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte R-Va. said he stressed to Obama the role Congress must play in ensuring that U.S. spying isn't infringing on Congress' intent or on civil liberties. He said his committee would further probe the issue including in a classified hearing he's hoping to hold in September.Extending its efforts to defend the programs to the public the White House pledged to help Americans understand as much as possible about how they work even as it staunchly defended their efficacy in keeping a post-9/11 America safe.""That process will continue"" said White House spokesman Jay Carney. ""But I don't think that we can sensibly say that programs designed to protect us from terrorist attack are not necessary in this day and age.""The more information about the programs the government has released the more it has fed even greater concerns about the scope of the surveillance and whether Obama's national security team has been truthful in describing it publicly in the past.After the administration on Wednesday declassified more documents about an email mining program Wyden said they showed the government had ""repeatedly made inaccurate statements to Congress"" about the effectiveness in countering terrorism. And new details released about the phone records program created new fodder for critics by confirming for the first time that when investigating one suspected terrorist the government can also examine records of people who called people who called the targeted individual — netting millions of people's records in a single request.Meanwhile the head of the NSA openly clashed with lawmakers including Sen. Patrick Leahy D-Vt. over the agency's statements that telephone and email data collection helped foil 54 terror plots.Rising tensions have stoked concern at the White House that surveillance programs Obama considers crucial will soon be undermined or even dismantled — despite the fact that many Democrats and Republicans in Congress have come to the NSA's defense.Leahy the Judiciary Committee chairman has threatened to seek to end the phone records program if it's not proven effective. And Sen. Jeff Merkley D-Ore. signaled Thursday that unless an agreement is reached on releasing more of the secret court's opinions he would push Congress to use its ""power of the purse"" to compel their disclosure by withholding funding for certain programs.Even some staunch advocates for a tough national security stance have become outspoken critics including Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner R-Wis. who helped write the USA Patriot Act but now says the phone records collection goes far beyond what he envisioned and may not be renewed. Sensenbrenner was among the lawmakers who shared concerns in the session Thursday with Obama and top officials including Biden National Security Advisory Susan Rice and White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler.The White House also was spooked by a House vote last week to dismantle the program which failed by a narrow 217-205 margin.___Associated Press writer Richard Lardner contributed to this report.___Follow Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP",1
201,Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told Fox News over the weekend that the Obama administration is telling individuals who were rescued during the deadly Benghazi attack last September to be quiet about what they know.Graham said he “had contact” with survivors and described their accounts as “chilling.” “The bottom line is they feel that they can’t come forth they’ve been told to be quiet.”White House Press Secretary Jay Carney refuted that the administration is gagging survivors telling Fox News last week “I’m sure that the White House is not preventing anyone from speaking”Graham does not buy it and is threatening to hold up all business in the upper chamber if the White House does not release the names of the survivors to Congress. Graham is urging his colleagues in the House to move forward and issue subpoenas of Benghazi survivors if the administration fails to release any information on them.“To our leadership in the House you’re gonna have to up your game on Benghazi” the South Carolina Republican said.Breitbart News first reported in December that Congressman Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) was being stonewalled by the Obama administration from visiting the injured survivors of the Benghazi attack.Since then Senator Graham has demanded the FBI turn over the interviews with the survivors to no avail. Graham Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) all called for a joint select committee to investigate the Benghazi assault while Congressman Frank Wolf (R-VA) re-issued a second resolution to form a House Select committee to do the same.Wolf and Rep. Jim Gerlach (R-PA) demanded Sec. Kerry to hand over the contact information of all the State Department employees who worked at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi when the attack occurred. Wolf’s resolution currently boasts over 60 co-sponsors.Congressman Mike Rogers (R-MI) chairman of the House Select Intelligence Committee and Congressman Darrell Issa (R-CA) chairman of the House Government Oversight Committee are looking forward to hear from Benghazi survivors as well.“We’ll get our chance to talk to Benghazi survivors and get the reports from the FBI. That will happen. I’m confident of that” Chairman Rogers told Breitbart News. “We want to make sure people have a chance to heal first and we’ll have an opportunity to talk these people before this is over. I’m fairly comfortable this will happen” he said.Chairman Issa noted that Secretary of State John Kerry’s visit to a Benghazi survivor opened the door for Congress to question anyone who was on the ground and survived the Benghazi attack. “We expected to speak with all the witnesses and the Benghazi survivors” he told Breitbart News. “Now that Secretary Kerry has publicly essentially a senator in a post way has chosen to visit with them any claim that they’re not available at this point to Congress is unsupportable. And I look forward to oversight by all committees.”Any Benghazi survivor who talks to his committee would be protected from prosecution or job termination from the Obama administration Rogers said. “We’ll make sure of that. That is whistle bower standard protection. If they’re fired for talking to us there’ll be some hell to pay.”Issa agrees saying “Any kind of retaliation against any of the witnesses we’ve already had would not be tolerated.”Four Americans were killed on site when the U.S. mission in Benghazi was attacked including U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens. Questions remain however as to the physical health of those who were evacuated from the U.S. compound. Rogers cannot confirm if any evacuee later succumbed to their injuries while being treated at medical facilities.The Michigan Republican explained “Like I said I don’t know. We’ll know before it’s over. My review is not over yet. We’re looking at all the information. We still have cables and emails that we still haven’t gone through one hundred percent yet. It’s voluminous.” He added “Were going through it painstakingly. I’m just an old FBI guy so I’m going through it painstakingly to find to find the truth. My goal is to find the truth. And wherever those facts and leads takes us.”,1
202,The Obama administration’s approach to federal whistleblowers has been likened to “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.”On the good doctor’s side President Obama has important accomplishments in protecting the rights of whistleblowers. Yet whistleblower advocates are fuming at the administration’s actions against federal employees whom it considers to be leakers of national security information.“There’s a schizophrenia within the administration” said Tom Devine legal director of the nonprofit Government Accountability Project. “It’s been Obama versus Obama on whistleblower policy. Until recently there was a virtual free-speech advocacy for whistleblower job rights that’s unprecedented more than any other president in history.“At the same time” Devine added “he has willingly allowed the Justice Department to prosecute whistleblowers on tenuous grounds.”That last point — the Mr. Hyde side — is the focus of the new film “War on Whistleblowers: Free Press and the National Security State.” (Disclosure: The documentary features comments by Dana Priest a Washington Post colleague.) It is a project of the Brave New Foundation a social justice advocacy organization. The film is being shown in theaters in New York City and Los Angeles but the main distribution channels will be iTunes Netflix Hulu Amazon and cable systems.The Justice Department rejects the notion that it is overzealous in its prosecution of those the government calls national security leakers.“Unauthorized disclosures of classified information cause damage to our national security and we take the investigation and prosecution of such matters very seriously” Dean Boyd a Justice Department spokesman said via e-mail. “In these and all other cases Justice Department investigators and prosecutors follow the facts and the law to determine whether charges are appropriate.”The Justice Department does not target whistleblowers he added: “However we cannot condone the knowing and willful disclosure of classified information to the media or others not entitled to such information. An individual in authorized possession of classified information has no authority or right to unilaterally determine that it should be made public or otherwise disclose it.”The film recognizes the president’s good side with a quick nod by Danielle Brian executive director of the Project on Government Oversight. The “good news” she said is passage of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act which Obama supported and his directive providing protection for national security whistleblowers. That mention however is not until 59 minutes into the 66-minute film.Balanced? No. But the stories about the government’s aggressive moves against federal employees who worked to uphold the finest traditions of public service are chilling and deserve the notice and outrage the film hopes to generate.Franz Gayl’s is the first case presented. The Defense Department civilian employee was punished for his efforts to save the lives of U.S. troops at war.“Hundreds of Marines were tragically lost and probably thousands maimed unnecessarily so I said let’s replace the Humvees with what are called MRAPs Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles” he says in the film.After taking his concerns to Pentagon officials with no luck he went to the news media. Then the blowback hit. He was stripped of his security clearance the lifeline for national security workers and suspended.“They were using all these personnel actions against me” he said. “I’m the substandard employee bottom 3 percent unreliable untrustworthy et cetera et cetera. After investigations and after all these personnel actions and reprisals I was placed on administrative leave.“I was fearful. If I have to leave the government now and I don’t have security clearances we’re gonna have to move away. I can’t get a job around here. You can’t do anything without a security clearance around [the] D.C. area. I knew that life was gonna go ‘foof’ fall off a cliff.”Gayl was fortunate to have whistleblower advocates who cushioned his fall. And in November 2011 after intervention by an Office of Special Counsel that was re-energized by Obama the military’s threat to suspend Gayl indefinitely was lifted and his security clearance was reinstated.There’s a lot left out of his story in this space and similar stories of other whistleblowers can’t be mentioned at all. Gayl’s is a distressing tale of Uncle Sam playing the bully making life hell for a federal employee who fought to better protect American troops.“I’m now working back at the Pentagon in the office from which I was removed” Gayl says at the end of the film. “I feel very lucky because I received a lot of support from a lot of outsiders that I don’t think every person in my situation gets.”The film makes you wonder how many more trampled and largely unknown federal whistleblowers like Gayl are out there.Previous columns by Joe Davidson are available at wapo.st/JoeDavidson.,1
203,On Friday two prominent Republican backers of the Senate immigration bill hosted a conference call with reporters to reveal the “history” behind some organizations opposing the legislation. According to the speakers a significant amount of the opposition to immigration reform is being led by liberals environmentalists and pro-abortion and eugenics activists worried about population growth.“[T]he primary leaders and funders of the anti-immigration movement were drawn to it because they were also active organizers and supporters of and contributors to the population-control movement in the United States” Mario Lopez a speaker on the call recently wrote. Lopez is President of the Hispanic Leadership Fund. Lopez was joined on the call by Josh Culling with Grover Norquist’s Americans for Tax Reform.This ad hominem argument is both inane and irrelevant. People come into issues from all kinds of vantage points. I have no doubt that there active immigration reform opponents who are liberals or have overblown worries about population growth. Those views however don’t discredit what they may say on a different issue. Nor do those views discredit what people without those views believe on an issue.Friday’s call was a leftist tactic to discount what millions of Americans feel about an issue because some other people hold views with which they would disagree. It was reminiscent of the media’s attempt to smear the entire Tea Party movement because a handful of people said or did something stupid.Even if one were to cede the premise that an entire infrastructure to oppose immigration reform were built by population control activists the fact is immaterial to the concerns many have about the legislation before the Senate. Even if you support expansive legal immigration it is a bad bill. Its fatal flaw is that it doesn’t secure the border or increase enforcement in any meaningful way. One doesn’t have to be a population control zealot to see the fundamental problem with that approach.Surely the speakers would hopefully acknowledge there are many opposed to the Senate bill who don’t believe in population control. I would wager the overwhelming majority of Americans who have concerns about the bill are not advocates of abortion or eugenics to control the population. So why are the views of a decided minority relevant to an issue with national implications?The richest irony of the call was that the speakers are allies of groups like SEIU and La Raza in supporting the specific Senate proposal. One could just as easily have a convened a press call to discuss the “history” behind these groups and why conservatives should be cautious about working with them. The speakers on the call for example acknowledged doing at least some work with the National Immigration Forum which has received considerable funding from George Soros’ Open Society Institute. Is that the proper alliance for a conservative?No one should schedule such a call however. Issues should be decided on merits not ad hominem aspersions about someone else’s motives. The call was an attempt to smear all opposition to the Senate bill as arising out of the questionable beliefs of a few people. It was an attempt to quash rather than foster debate on the underlying merits of the proposal.The call also perpetuated a dangerously false choice. Conservatives should either accept legislation largely written by Sen. Chuck Schumer or be labeled as against reform. That our allies are forcing this choice is unconscionable.,1

As odd as it may sound coming from me"" Putin told a news conference in Moscow.""Russia has never extradited anyone and is not going to do so"" Putin said adding that Snowden ""should choose his final destination and go there.""Snowden released a statement Monday through the web site WikiLeaks critical of Obama for asking Russia to send him back after he said the president vowed not to engage in ""wheeling and dealing"" over his return.""This kind of deception from a world leader is not justice and neither is the extralegal penalty of exile"" stated Snowden who U.S. passport has been revoked. ""These are the old bad tools of political aggression. Their purpose is to frighten not me but those who would come after me.""Obama said last week that he would not offer special inducements to other nations over a routine matter of law enforcement that should be honored as part of international law. He has said the NSA secret surveillance programs that Snowden made public are legal and proper aimed only at disrupting terrorist plots.Snowden insisted Monday that he is a whistle-blower who should be allowed to go where he pleases and compared himself to Army Pvt. Bradley Manning who is being court-martialed for sending secret diplomatic communications on Iraq and Afghanistan to WikiLeaks.The 30-year-old Snowden still appears to be holed up in Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport where he landed after fleeing Hong Kong. Interfax news agency quoted consular desk official Kim Shevchenko as saying that British citizen Sarah Harrison -- an aide to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange -- asked the Russian Foreign Ministry on Monday to grant Snowden political asylum.The reported request comes after Ecuador hedged on whether it would grant Snowden protection as it has Assange who is hiding out in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden on rape charges. The Los Angeles Times reported Monday that Snowden had given Russian diplomats a list of 15 countries to which he would like to apply for political asylum.Meanwhile the office of Germany's federal prosecutor said it is launching a preliminary inquiry into allegations from Snowden that U.S. intelligence agencies tapped European communication channels.German news weekly Der Spiegel set off a diplomatic row when it reported that the NSA had bugged EU offices in Washington New York and Brussels. The report cited secret U.S. documents allegedly obtained by the Snowden before he fled the United States.Germany said it planned to call in the U.S. ambassador for an explanation over the ""breach in trust.""""We're no longer in the Cold War"" government spokesman Steffen Seibert told USA TODAY. ""Eavesdropping on friends is unacceptable.""Seibert said the government will assess the facts to determine whether there had been a breach of national security. Secretary of State John Kerry said he did know all the particulars about allegations that the U.S. bugged EU offices. But he says many nations engaged in international affairs undertake lots of different kinds of activities to protect their national interests.""The (German) foreign ministry must be shocked and horrified that it was put in with that company"" said Ben Tonra a professor at the University College Dublin who specializes on European security issues.Tonra said European leaders are well aware that all governments including their own spy on each other but the revelations if accurate could force European governments to react publicly in ways that harm relations.Other European officials reacted angrily to Der Spiegel reports that the NSA was spying on the European Union including the Justus Lipsius building in Brussels -- home to the European Council.""We still need more information but If it's true it's a huge scandal"" said Martin Schulz head of the European Parliament. ""It means a huge strain on relations between the EU and the U.S. and we now demand a comprehensive explanation.""Snowden indicated he may reveal more about the NSA programs that he gained access to while working for a private contractor that provided analytical services to the NSA.""I remain free and able to publish information that serves the public interest"" Snowden said in an undated Spanish-language letter sent to President Rafael Correa of Ecuador seen by Reuters.Contributing: Louise Osborne from Berlin; Tilton reported from Berlin; Hjelmgaard in London",1
205,After Dzokhar Tsarnaev the 19-year-old suspected Boston Marathon bomber whose older brother was killed earlier in a shootout was captured alive on Friday after a extensive manhunt a dour President Barack Obama addressed the nation. While he was adamant that the American people do not hold these heinous acts against “entire groups of people” he did not mention radical Islam at all.In a stoic Friday evening address that was in contrast to the jubilant atmosphere on Boston’s streets Obama spoke of the “resolve and determination” of those in Boston sent his condolences to the family of the MIT police officer who was murdered on Friday by the suspects and praised Boston’s police officers.He vowed to “determine what happened” and find “any associations these terrorists may have had.” Obama also said “we’ve seen the character of this country” during this “tough week” and that the people of Boston refused to be intimidated and Americans “refuse to be terrorized.”He became most animated though when speaking about how Americans should not “latch on to any bit of information sometimes to jump to conclusions” before facts are “relentlessly” gathered.“That’s why we take care not to rush to judgement not about the motivations of these individuals and certainly not about entire groups of people” Obama said.Contrary to what Obama and the mainstream media may think Americans do not “rush to judgment” without any evidence. In this case there has already been plenty of pieces of evidence to suggest radical Islam may have influenced the suspected bombers especially older brother Tamerlan.In an interview with Russia Today the mother of the suspects said the FBI “were scared of my oldest son” because “they always told me he’s a leader” and they were “afraid of him because you know he is a leader he talks about Islam a lot.”She said her eldest son got involved in “religious politics” five years ago and the FBI was scared of him because of the information he was getting from “extremist” websites.But the mother perhaps like Obama seemed to be in denial by claiming her sons could not be involved in Jihad and were “set up” by the FBI. The mother claimed the sons would have told her of the terrorist attacks if they really in her mind had intended to bomb the Boston Marathon.On Monday evening in his first address to the nation after the Boston Marathon bombings Obama did not refer to the bombings as terrorism. Immediately after he spoke the White House had to issue a statement that they considered the bombings an “act of terror.”Obama had to clean up the mess on Tuesday and do damage control in what seemed like a press conference that was called just so Obama could say the words “act of terror” on camera.Robert Baer a former CIA official said on Friday that that there is a “cultural fight” between radical Islam and the West and the older brother may have “identified with Jihadism” when “he found religion and wanted to defend Islam” because “it gave him meaning.” Even Piers Morgan Even Piers Morgan who is largely sympathetic to Obama and his agenda discussed the suspected bomber’s potential ties to radical Islam on Friday evening.But the Obama administration consistently seems to be either oblivious to or dismissive of the threat of global Jihad. And while Obama has rightfully warned Americans not to make judgments without evidence Obama has too often ignored evidence of radical Islam’s influence.For instance the Obama administration refused to call the Fort Hood massacre an act of terror instead referring to it as “workplace violence.” He also took three days to address the nation after the attempted Christmas Day airplane bombing in 2009.,1

Photographer: Andrew Harer/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesThe recent revelations about the National Security Agency's vast powers of surveillance have served to reaffirm if any such thing was needed the value of leaks and whistleblowers to both journalism and to democracy.On Wednesday morning Americans knew next to nothing about the extent to which their government was collecting data about them. By Friday morning the country's director of national intelligence had confirmed the existence of a program that in the words of the Washington Post involved the NSA ""tapping directly into the central servers of nine leading U.S. Internet companies extracting audio and video chats photographs e-mails documents and connection logs that enable analysts to track foreign targets.""Americans learned about these things because there were people inside the government who were willing to leak them and journalists who were willing to report on them. At a time when the Justice Department's surveillance of journalists has aroused deep anger the flood of new information about the NSA's activities is a reminder of the vital need for those journalists to be able to do their jobs without fear.The Guardian's explosive piece on Wednesday about the NSA's continual tracking of Verizon customers was a classic leak story. Glenn Greenwald the blogger who broke the news for the paper told the Times that his source was ""a reader of mine"" who ""knew the views that I had and had an expectation of how I would display them.""That leak then inspired more reporting as leaks often do. People could watch media outlets trying to outgun each other on Thursday as they sought to round out the story of the surveillance programs.They could read the Wall Street Journal's report that AT&T and Sprint were also involved in the data-mining program or watch an NBC News segment which said that ""a secret surveillance program is collecting the telephone records of every single one of us.""They could learn that two senators had been sending cryptic warnings to them for years about how horrified they might be if they learned about the extent of the surveillance.They could hear people they had voted into office admit that the program had been ongoing for seven years.On Thursday the Post and the Guardian upped the stakes when they reported about the so-called ""PRISM"" program that accessed the Internet companies (including AOL HuffPost's parent company). Again it was a classic whistleblowing case as the Post vividly reported.The paper identified its source as a ""career intelligence officer"" who had been horrified about what he was seeing:Firsthand experience with these systems and horror at their capabilities is what drove a career intelligence officer to provide PowerPoint slides about PRISM and supporting materials to The Washington Post in order to expose what he believes to be a gross intrusion on privacy. “They quite literally can watch your ideas form as you type” the officer said.It appears likely if reports are to be believed that that officer will be hunted down by the government whose secrets he has just exposed.All of this information was completely secret on Wednesday morning. Two days later the entire federal government apparatus had been forced to acknowledge its existence and hundreds of millions people were much more aware of the huge size of the American surveillance state. As the Associated Press's Matt Apuzzo tweeted ""THIS is why America needs 'leakers.'""",1

210,WASHINGTON — The Senate on Thursday approved the most significant overhaul of the nation’s immigration laws in a generation with broad support generated by a sense among leading Republicans that the party needed to join with Democrats to remove a wedge between Republicans and Hispanic voters.The strong 68-to-32 vote in the often polarized Senate tossed the issue into the House where the Republican leadership has said that it will not take up the Senate measure and is instead focused on much narrower legislation that would not provide a path to citizenship for the 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the country. Party leaders hope that the Senate action will put pressure on the House.Leading up to the final votes which the senators cast at their desks to mark the import of the moment members of the bipartisan “Gang of Eight” who drafted the framework of the legislation took to the Senate floor to make a final argument for the measure. Among them was Senator Marco Rubio Republican of Florida who is one of his party’s leading Hispanic voices. When Mr. Rubio finished the other senators in the group surrounded him on the floor patting him on the back and offering words of encouragement. “Good job” one said. “I’m proud of you” another offered.The future will show whether voters in Republican presidential primaries share that pride.After Mitt Romney’s loss in November top Republicans immediately began formulating a way to improve the party’s standing with Hispanics who have flocked to Democrats. A group of top Republican political and business officials who support an immigration overhaul met at the downtown Washington office of the anti-tax leader Grover Norquist on Jan. 17 with memories of Mr. Romney’s poor showing in their minds.,1
211,Should the local police and sheriff’s deputies be doing more to help the federal government enforce civil immigration laws? For years the disturbing answer from the Obama administration and hard-line states like Arizona has been: absolutely. Each has tried in its own way to expand the role of local law enforcement in catching unauthorized immigrants and feeding the deportation pipeline.But states and cities are rejecting the blurring of a once-bright line that separated local cops and federal immigration agents. They recognize that a broken immigration system has stranded many people outside the law but know that many have lived here for years with clean records and citizen children and would be on track to become Americans if the legislation now stalled in Congress ever passes. Deporting millions of harmless people — current taxpayers future citizens — is a misguided mission for the nation. For the local police it’s a costly and dangerous diversion from their main job: preventing crime and catching criminals.California and New Orleans are two places tackling this question with encouraging results. New Orleans has just settled a lengthy court battle to rein in a sheriff who had turned his jail cells into long-term holding pens for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A bill now moving through the California Legislature would strictly limit the role of local law enforcement in feeding inmates to ICE. Serious criminals would still be turned over for deportation but others in jail for minor offenses would not be held on ICE’s behalf.The New Orleans case involves a civil rights lawsuit brought by two immigrant workers who served short sentences for minor crimes then languished in prison for months waiting for ICE to pick them up. The sheriff of Orleans Parish Marlin Gusman complied with an ICE request to hold the men Mario Cacho and Antonio Ocampo over possible immigration violations. Such requests called detainers are supposed to have a time limit: ICE has 48 hours to take an inmate into custody. But Mr. Cacho was held for more than 160 days; Mr. Ocampo more than 90. There were no federal charges against either of them.,0
212,Back to previous pageEdward Snowden comes forward as source of NSA leaksBy Barton Gellman Aaron Blake and Greg MillerA 29-year-old man who says he is a former undercover CIA employee said Sunday that he was the principal source of recent disclosures about ­top-secret National Security Agency programs exposing himself to possible prosecution in an acknowledgment that had little if any precedent in the long history of U.S. intelligence leaks.Edward Snowden a tech specialist who has contracted for the NSA and works for the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton unmasked himself as a source after a string of stories in The Washington Post and the Guardian that detailed previously unknown U.S. surveillance programs. He said he disclosed secret documents in response to what he described as the systematic surveillance of innocent citizens.In an interview Sunday Snowden said he is willing to face the consequences of exposure.“I’m not going to hide” Snowden told The Post from Hong Kong where he has been staying. “Allowing the U.S. government to intimidate its people with threats of retaliation for revealing wrongdoing is contrary to the public interest.”Asked whether he believes that his disclosures will change anything he said: “I think they already have. Everyone everywhere now understands how bad things have gotten — and they’re talking about it. They have the power to decide for themselves whether they are willing to sacrifice their privacy to the surveillance state.”Snowden said nobody had been aware of his actions including those closest to him. He said there was no single event that spurred his decision to leak the information but he said President Obama has failed to live up to his pledges of transparency.“My sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them” he said in a note that accompanied the first document he leaked to The Post.The Guardian was the first to publicly identify Snowden at his request.The White House said late Sunday that it would not have any comment on the matter.In a brief statement a spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the intelligence community is “reviewing the damage” the leaks have done. “Any person who has a security clearance knows that he or she has an obligation to protect classified information and abide by the law” said the spokesman Shawn Turner.Snowden said he is seeking “asylum from any countries that believe in free speech and oppose the victimization of global privacy” but the law appears to provide for his extradition from Hong Kong a semiautonomous territory of China to the United States.Although any extradition proceeding could take months or even years experts said Snowden has not put himself in a favorable position.“The fact that he outed himself and basically said from what I understand he has said ‘I feel very comfortable with what I have done’ . . . that’s not going to help him in his extradition contest” said Douglas McNabb a lawyer and extradition expert.The Justice Department said it is in the “initial stages of an investigation” into the unauthorized disclosure of classified information but declined to comment further.A stunning revelationCurrent and former U.S. intelligence officials said the revelation of Snowden’s role in the leaks will lead to a sweeping reexamination of security measures at the CIA and the NSA and they described his decision to come forward as a stunning conclusion to a week of disclosures that rattled the intelligence community.“This is significant on a number of fronts: the scope the range. It’s major it’s major” said John Rizzo a former general counsel of the CIA who worked at the agency for decades. “And then to have him out himself . . . I can’t think of any previous leak case involving a CIA officer where the officer raised his hand and said ‘I’m the guy.’ ”A half-dozen former intelligence officials including one who now works at Booz Allen Hamilton said they did not know Snowden or anything about his background. Several former officials said he easily could have been part of a surge in computer experts and technical hires brought in by the CIA in the years after the Sept. 11 2001 attacks as its budget and mission swelled.“Like a lot of things after 9/11 they just went on a hiring binge and in the technical arena young smart nerds were in high demand” a former U.S. intelligence official said. “There were battalions of them.”Officials said the CIA and other spy agencies did not relax their screening measures as the workforce expanded. Still several officials said the CIA will now undoubtedly begin reviewing the process by which Snowden may have been hired seeking to determine whether there were any missed signs that he might one day betray national secrets.More broadly the CIA and the NSA may be forced to reexamine their relationships with contractors who were employed in roles ranging from technical support to paramilitary operations before concerns about the outsourcing of such sensitive assignments prompted a backlash in Congress and pledges from the agencies to begin thinning their contracting ranks.Some former CIA officials said they were troubled by aspects of Snowden’s background at least as he described it to The Post and the Guardian.For instance Snowden said he did not have a high school diploma. One former CIA official said that it was extremely unusual for the agency to have hired someone with such thin academic credentials particularly for a technical job and that the terms Snowden used to describe his agency positions did not match internal job descriptions.Snowden’s claim to have been placed under diplomatic cover for a position in Switzerland after an apparently brief stint at the CIA as a systems administrator also raised suspicion. “I just have never heard of anyone being hired with so little academic credentials” the former CIA official said. The agency does employ technical specialists in overseas stations the former official said “but their breadth of experience is huge and they tend not to start out as systems administrators.”A former senior U.S. intelligence official cited other puzzling aspects of Snowden’s account questioning why a contractor for Booz Allen at an NSA facility in Hawaii would have access to something as sensitive as a court order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.“I don’t know why he would have had access to those . . . orders out in Hawaii” the former official said.The Guardian initially reported the existence of a program that collects data on all phone calls made on the Verizon network. Later in the week the Guardian and The Post reported the existence of a separate program code-named PRISM that collects the Internet data of foreigners from major Internet companies.Snowden expressed hope that the NSA surveillance programs will now be open to legal challenge for the first time. This year in Amnesty International v. Clapper the Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit against the mass collection of phone records because the plaintiffs could not prove exactly what the program did or that they were personally subject to surveillance.“The government can’t reasonably assert the state-secrets privilege for a program it has acknowledged” Snowden said.Journalists criticizedSnowden’s name surfaced as top intelligence officials in the Obama administration and Congress pushed back against the journalists responsible for revealing the existence of sensitive surveillance programs and called for an investigation into the leaks.Clapper in an interview with NBC that aired Saturday night condemned the leaker’s actions but also sought to spotlight the journalists who first reported the programs calling their disclosures irresponsible and full of “hyperbole.” Earlier Saturday he issued a statement accusing the media of a “rush to publish.”“For me it is literally — not figuratively — literally gut-wrenching to see this happen because of the huge grave damage it does to our intelligence capabilities” Clapper said.On Sunday morning before Snowden’s unmasking House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) had harsh words for the leaker and for the journalist who first reported the NSA’s collection of phone records the Guardian’s Glenn Greenwald.Greenwald “doesn’t have a clue how this thing works; neither did the person who released just enough information to literally be dangerous” Rogers said on ABC’s “This Week” adding: “I absolutely think [the leaker] should be prosecuted.”Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) agreed that whoever leaked the information should be prosecuted and she sought to beat back media reports suggesting that the Obama administration overplayed the impact of the programs.After opponents of the programs questioned their value last week anonymous administration officials pointed to the thwarting of a bomb plot targeting the New York City subway system in 2009. Soon after though reporters noted that public documents suggested that regular police work was responsible for thwarting the attack rather than a secret government intelligence program.Feinstein said the programs were valuable in both the New York case and in another involving an American plotting to bomb a hotel in India in 2008. She noted that she could talk about those two cases because they have been declassified but she suggested that the surveillance programs also assisted in other terrorism-related cases.A chief critic of the efforts Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said he is considering filing a lawsuit against the government and called on 10 million Americans to join in.“I’m going to be asking all the Internet providers and all of the phone companies ask your customers to join me in a class-action lawsuit” Paul said on “Fox News Sunday.”Sari Horwitz and Julie Tate contributed to this report.,0
213,This post has been updated. See below for details.SACRAMENTO — A day after FBI agents raided the Capitol office of Sen. Ron Calderon (D-Montebello) local officials from Southern California said they have been interviewed by federal agents about the senator’s connection to a local water board.While the U.S. Attorney’s office on Wednesday remained mum about the focus of the investigation the Central Basin Municipal Water District has been at the center of a number of controversies for years. Some of those controversies have focused on the Calderon family’s relationship with the district.FOR THE RECORD:Calderon investigation: An article in the June 6 Section A about an FBI investigation into Sen. Ron Calderon (D-Montebello) said that the senator’s brother former Assemblyman Tom Calderon received $140000 per year from the company Water2Save which was chosen for a project by the Central Basin Municipal Water District. Tom Calderon’s $140000-per-year contract was with Central Basin. He had a separate consulting contract with Water2Save.Among those who have raised public concerns about the district is Congresswoman Grace Napolitano (D-Norwalk). In an interview Wednesday she said she has heard complaints from cities she represents dating back more than a decade about the Central Basin Water District’s lack of transparency and questionable spending of public funds.AdvertisementIN DEPTH: Calderon targeted by FBIIn particular Napolitano questioned how the district spent $5.6 million in federal funds she helped secure to build infrastructure for a regional system to recycle water.The district received a subsequent research grant from the Department of Energy in conjunction with HydroEarth a Lake Forest-based water management firm. But instead of moving forward with the original research proposal Central Basin amended the project and opened it up for competitive bidding. Staffers subsequently chose to partner with a different company Water2Save a firm that paid Ron Calderon’s brother former Assemblyman Tom Calderon $140000 per year.[UPDATED: 3:22 p.m. June 5: Tom Calderon also received more than $10000 per month as a consultant for the district.]AdvertisementQuestions emerged from cities in the area about increased water rates and how the district was spending that money. Napolitano said she was never able to get answers about what was happening.“It was just ridiculous” she said. “This is ratepayer money. It’s not the Central Basin’s money.”In 2009 she pushed for state auditors to step in and examine the board’s proposed rate hike its spending of federal stimulus dollars and review its spending on lobbying and political consultants.Napolitano blames Ron Calderon for thwarting her audit request. “I was concerned there was state money too that was being misused” she said.AdvertisementShe said Calderon assured state officials he would convene meetings of local stakeholders to work through their concerns. Those meetings never happened according to Napolitano.Concerns extend to cities that are members of the Central Basin Water District.“There’s been a lot of seemingly dubious things in regards to their contracts the costs of certain projects and how they spend their money” said Thaddeus McCormack city manager for Santa Fe Springs. “We’ve had questions for a long time. Now we may finally get some answers to those questions.”One of McCormack’s concerns involved the Calderons. “Tom is a paid consultant to the district. We believe the senator is an advocate for them. That connection never seemed comfortable” he said. “It’s raised eyebrows for years.”AdvertisementIn 2011 Ron Calderon introduced a bill that would have given the Central Basin control over groundwater in the area part of an ongoing rivalry between Central Basin and a neighboring water district.The bill died in the Senate without ever having a hearing.Another city official in Los Angeles County who declined to be identified speaking about the investigation said he spoke with the FBI about the water district.The conversation focused on consulting contracts held by Tom Calderon and legislation authored by Ron Calderon the official said.Advertisement“That was 100% of what they were asking about” the official added.Note: An earlier version of this post said that Tom Calderon is a paid consultant for the water district. That contract was terminated earlier this year according to James Roybal president of the Central Basin Municipal Water District’s board of directorsALSO:Federal probe rocks California CapitolAdvertisementWater agency draws fire after filing unusual libel suitBefore Calderon office raid FBI checked out agency tied to senatoranthony.york@latimes.com@anthonyyorklat,0
214,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama has chosen a high-powered Washington lawyer with extensive experience in all three branches of the government to be the State Department's special envoy for closing down the military-run prison at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba.Clifford Sloan is the pick to reopen the State Department's Office of Guantanamo Closure shuttered since January and folded into the department's legal adviser's office when the administration in the face of congressional obstacles effectively gave up its attempt to close the prison.A formal announcement of Sloan's appointment was expected Monday according to officials briefed on the matter. They spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the appointment publicly before the formal announcement.Sloan has served in senior government positions in both Democratic and Republican administrations and is now a partner in the Skadden Arps Slate Meagher and Flom LLP law firm. For the past several years he has been an informal adviser to Secretary of State John Kerry who recommended him for the post the officials said.""I appreciate his willingness to take on this challenge"" Kerry said in a statement. ""Cliff and I share the president's conviction that Guantanamo's continued operation isn't in our security interests.""The move fulfills part of Obama's pledge last month to renew efforts to close the military-run detention center at Guantanamo. That was a major promise in his 2008 presidential campaign but it ran aground due to opposition from congressional Republicans.In late May Obama lifted a self-imposed ban on transferring Guantanamo detainees to Yemen in what was a step toward closing a prison that he said ""has become a symbol around the world for an America that flouts the rule of law."" He said he would name envoys at both the State Department and Pentagon to try to unblock the closure process. The Pentagon envoy position has yet to be filled.Story continuesWord of the Sloan's appointment comes follows the House's overwhelming passage Friday of a $638 billion defense bill that would block Obama from closing the detention facility. The House acted despite a White House veto threat.The administration cited Guantanamo's prohibitive costs and role as a recruiting tool for extremists. A hunger strike by more than 100 of the 166 prisoners protesting their conditions and indefinite confinement has prompted the fresh calls for closure. Obama is pushing to transfer 86 approved detainees to their home countries. Fifty-six of the 86 are from Yemen.Officials said Sloan whose diverse government experience includes clerking for liberal Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens and conservative prosecutor Kenneth Starr would focus primarily on navigating between the administration and Congress to overcome the deep largely partisan divide over closing Guantanamo.""It will not be easy but if anyone can effectively navigate the space between agencies and branches of government it's Cliff"" Kerry said. ""He's someone respected by people as ideologically different as Kenneth Starr and Justice Stevens and that's the kind of bridge-builder we need to finish this job.""",1
215,"Story highlights NEW: The top U.S. intel official says leaks affect national security Some say the program is key to fighting terrorism and includes oversight The program was used to stop ""terrorist plots"" on U.S. soil Sen. Feinstein says Critics say it's overreach with Al Gore calling it ""obscenely outrageous""(CNN) —Frightening government overreach or valuable law enforcement tool?That’s the question politicians in Washington and millions of citizens around the United States asked Thursday thanks to a jolting report suggesting the government has been collecting millions of Americans’ phone records.FBI Direct Robert Mueller will be asked about the matter – revealed after a British newspaper the Guardian published a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court order that applied to phone data from Verizon – when he appears next week before the House Judiciary Committee. The panel’s chairman Bob Goodlatte R-Virginia issued a statement Thursday saying he was “very concerned that the Department of Justice may have abused the intent of the law and we will investigate.”Reports: U.S. spy agencies mined Internet dataThe report will also be the subject of an upcoming classified briefing by Attorney General Eric Holder to the Senate Appropriations Committee. Its chairman Sen. Barbara Mikulski is calling for a similar closed-door briefing for the entire U.S. Senate.When she read the news Thursday morning the Maryland Democrat said “It was like ‘Oh God not one more thing … where we’re trying to protect America and then it looks like we’re spying.’”What does the Verizon order mean for me?An author of the Patriot Act – the legislation used to justify the program – added he is “extremely disturbed by what appears to be an overbroad interpretation of the act.”“These reports are deeply concerning and raise questions about whether our constitutional rights are secure” Rep. James Sensenbrenner R-Wisconsin wrote in a letter to Holder.But not everyone in the nation’s capital is outraged or even concerned. Some say the real travesty would be if the program which they describe as valuable is halted.Sen. Dianne Feinstein chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee said the Guardian story refers to a “three-month renewal of what has been the case for the past seven years” – so that while the uproar may be new the program is not. In that time it’s helped to disrupt “terrorist plots” on U.S. soil she said.“It is lawful” the California Democrat insisted. “It has been briefed by Congress.”Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Michigan) and Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Maryland) two key members of the House Intelligence Committee both stressed that “this important collection tool does not allow the government to eavesdrop” and that it is routinely reviewed by Congress.White House spokesman Josh Earnest also made those points adding President Barack Obama “put in place a stronger regime of oversight” when he took office. He further stressed the importance of ensuring “we have the tools we need to confront the threat posted by terrorists (and to) protect the homeland.”“That is his top priority” Earnest said of domestic security. “But … we need to balance that priority with the need to protect civil liberties and constitutional rights of American people. And that is the subject of a worthy debate.”What’s been happening and for how long?In 2006 it was reported the National Security Agency was secretly collecting telephone records in an effort to root out terror plots.“Verizon’s wireless and wireline companies did not provide to NSA customer records or call data local or otherwise” the company said at the time.Like the FBI and the NSA Verizon declined comment to the media Thursday on the Guardian report. But company Vice President Randy Milch in a note to employees did say the newspaper’s story may spur the company to respond in defiance of a promise of secrecy.The newspaper published the four-page top-secret government order requiring “originating and terminating” phone numbers plus the location time and duration of calls from the communications giant. It lets the FBI and NSA to obtain the records from April 25 to July 19.7 things to knowThe order applies to Verizon Business Network Services an operation not described on the company’s website. Its scope was not immediately clear though the Guardian claimed “millions of U.S. customers of Verizon” were affected by the collection of information “regardless of whether they are suspected of wrongdoing.”In his letter to Verizon employees Milch said that his company would not provide the contents of any communications “or the name address or financial information of a subscriber or customer.”An Obama administration official said any such order would relate “exclusively to metadata such as a telephone number or the length of a call.”This kind of information “allows counterterrorism personnel to discover whether known or suspected terrorists have been in contact with other persons who may be engaged in terrorist activities” the unnamed official said in a statement to media.Controversy over the Guardian report comes as the White House fends off privacy complaints on other fronts as well. The administration is under fire following revelations the Justice Department seized two months of phone records from Associated Press reporters and editors – something done as part of an investigation into leaks of classified information.Plus the Washington Post and the Guardian reported that U.S. intelligence has a broad secret data mining program that allows access to central servers of nine leading U.S. Internet companies – among them Microsoft Yahoo Google Facebook and Apple – to extract e-mail photos and other private consumer communications.Director of National Intelligence James Clapper challenged the Post and Guardian reports in a statement Thursday night saying “they contain numerous inaccuracies.” Specifically he emphasized the section of the law tied to that reported program “cannot be used to intentionally target any U.S. citizen any other U.S. person or anyone located within the United States.”In statements on that and reports about collecting phone data Clapper also called out those behind the apparent leaks – saying it “will have an impact on the behavior of our adversaries and make it more difficult for us to understand their intentions.”Speaking specifically about collecting personal phone records privacy advocates called the practice perilous and claimed it gives authorities access to information of many Americans who aren’t terrorists. In fact they might not necessarily be Verizon customers and similar orders might also apply to other telecommunications companies.“There is no indication that this order to Verizon was unique or novel” said the Electronic Frontier Foundation which fights to protect privacy.“It is very likely that business records orders like this exist for every major American telecommunication company meaning that if you make calls in the United States the NSA has those records. And this has been going on for at least seven years and probably longer.”Opinion: NSA’s phone snooping a different kind of creepyAl Gore: ‘Secret blanket surveillance obscenely outrageous’This group is hardly alone.The American Civil Liberties Union called it “beyond Orwellian (in allowing) basic democratic rights (to be) surrendered in secret to the demands of unaccountable intelligence agencies.”The Center for Constitutional Rights blasted it as “the broadest surveillance order to ever had been issued: It requires no level of suspicion.”Many in President Barack Obama’s own party spoke forcefully against it as well.Three Democratic representatives – John Conyers of Michigan Jerrold Nadler of New York and Robert Scott of Virginia – said the program is “highly problematic and reveals serious flaws in the scope and application of the” Patriot Act.“(The revelations) confirm our fears – that the law would be distorted to allow for ongoing indiscriminate collection of data” they wrote.Sen. Mark Udall who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee described the program as “the kind of government overreach I’ve said Americans would find shocking.”One of them: former Vice President Al Gore.“Is it just me or is secret blanket surveillance obscenely outrageous?” the 2000 Democratic presidential nominee wrote on Twitter.Senator says ending program would be ‘catastrophic’Opinions were also strong on the other side of the debate.“Terrorists will come after us if they can and the only thing that we have to deter this is good intelligence to understand that a plot has been hatched and to get there before they get to us” said Feinstein.Her intelligence committee’s ranking Republican Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia concurred in stating the program has let authorities gather “significant information on bad guys and only on bad guys over the years.”Former FBI Assistant Director Tom Fuentes a CNN contributor said that if a phone number comes up that’s linked to someone suspicious they can go back and get information tied to that number.“It’s not that someone or some group of analysts can sit there and monitor 50 million phone calls going through the computers” Fuentes explained on CNN’s “Starting Point.” “But it would create the ability to go back and see if you could connect phone calls.”Rep. Lindsey Graham said that as a Verizon customer “it doesn’t bother me one bit for the National Security Administration to have my phone number.” The South Carolina Republican said he’s confident the government won’t monitor his and other innocent Americans phone calls just because their “number pops up on some terrorist’s phone.”“The consequences of taking these tools away from the American people through their government would be catastrophic” he said.CNN’s Chelsea J.

218,"Story highlights NEW: President Obama says ""we just need Congress to finish the job"" The 68-32 Senate vote sends the measure to the House for consideration Speaker Boehner says the House will stick to its own version of immigration reform The Senate bill offers a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants(CNN) —The U.S. Senate gave final approval Thursday to a roughly 1200-page bill that promises to overhaul immigration laws for the first time since 1986 creating a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented residents while ratcheting up security along the Mexican border.Senators passed the sweeping legislation – initially drafted by the four Democrats and four Republicans in the chamber’s so-called “Gang of Eight” – by a 68-32 vote.Fourteen Republicans joined a united Democratic caucus in supporting the bill which is backed by the White House and has the potential to become the crowning legislative achievement of President Barack Obama’s second term.In a White House statement Obama hailed the Senate vote as “a critical step” toward fixing what he called a broken immigration system. He labeled the measure that now goes to the Republican-controlled House a compromise adding that “we just need Congress to finish the job.”The Senate vote included a rare adherence to old-fashioned protocol. Vice President Joe Biden presided in his constitutional capacity as head of the Senate and senators voted one-by-one from their desks calling out “aye” or “no.”Republican Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas broke the drama of the moment when he mistakenly voted “aye” then quickly asked the clerk to make it “no” as the chamber erupted in laughter. Biden tapped his gavel and called for order.Before announcing the result Biden warned against outbursts from the public gallery but chants of “Yes we can” and “Si se puede” broke out after he read the tally. Biden called for the sergeant at arms to restore order.“Today is another historic day in the Senate” said Sen. Patrick Leahy D-Vermont. “This legislation will reunite families. It will bring millions of people out of the shadows and into our legal system. It will spur job growth and reduce our deficit. And it will make us safer.”“The time has come to act in the interest of all Americans” declared Sen. Bob Menendez D-New Jersey a member of the Gang of Eight. “I hope that message will be heard loud and clear in the House (of Representatives).”Historic ruling opens door for immigration for same-sex spousesMost congressional conservatives however remain staunchly opposed to the measure and have declared it dead on arrival in the House.Obama warned in his statement that opponents of immigration reform will try even harder to derail it. Noting the broad support for the Senate bill from the business community organized labor and others he urged people to contact their House representatives and “tell them to do the right thing.”Republicans are sharply divided over the politically sensitive issue. In the wake of the GOP’s crushing loss among Hispanics in the 2012 election many top voices in the party have pushed for an endorsement of some form of a path to citizenship for the country’s roughly 11 million undocumented residents.“No one should dispute (that) like every sovereign nation on this planet we have a right to control who comes in. But unlike other countries we are not afraid of people coming in here from other places” said Florida Sen. Marco Rubio the most prominent Republican in the Gang of Eight and a potential 2016 presidential candidate. “I support this reform. Not just because I believe in immigrants but because I believe in America even more.”For many of the GOP’s strongest supporters any path to citizenship for those who entered the country illegally is a form of unforgivable amnesty. They also don’t trust the Obama administration to fully enact the bill’s new border security measures which are generally opposed by progressives.“There’s just no way I can look my constituents in the eye and tell them that today’s assurances won’t become tomorrow’s disappointments” said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell R-Kentucky. “We’ll never resolve the immigration problem on a bipartisan basis either now or in the future until we can prove that the border is secure as a condition of legalization.”Senate takes another step toward passing immigration reformSen. Mike Lee R-Utah called the vote on the measure “largely symbolic” and predicted the bill would ultimately be relegated to the “ash heap of history.”If enacted the measure would create a 13-year path to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants while raising the cap on visas for high skilled workers and establishing a new visa program for low skilled workers on America’s farms.A recently added border security amendment – introduced by GOP Sens. John Hoeven of North Dakota and Bob Corker of Tennessee – would require 20000 more border agents complete 700 miles of fence along the boundary with Mexico and deploy $3.2 billion in technology upgrades similar to equipment used by U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.The amendment also strengthens eligibility verification and border entry-exit controls.Most undocumented immigrants would be eligible for permanent residency only after the five conditions have been met and verified by the Department of Homeland Security.While Corker’s and Hoeven’s change appeared to sway some reticent Republicans in the Senate top House Republicans remained opposed the overall blueprint.“Apparently some haven’t gotten the message: the House is not going to take up and vote on whatever the Senate passes” said Speaker John Boehner R-Ohio. “We’re going to do our own bill … and move the legislation that reflects the will of our majority and the will of the American people.”House Republicans have indicated their intention to tackle the issue with several smaller proposals instead of one larger bill.Boehner repeated his pledge to block a vote on any immigration measure that doesn’t have the support of a majority of House Republicans. Democrats contend the Senate version would pass the House if brought to a vote with a united Democratic caucus joined by some Republicans.The speaker also refused to take a position on whether or not there should be some kind of path to citizenship for those who entered the country illegally.Democrats have repeatedly warned they will not agree to a plan that lacks such a path.Regardless Boehner said he hopes the House will deal with immigration reform this year.“I have made it clear since the day after the election that this political football should stop and that the Congress should deal with this issue” he said.Farm bill failure portends problems for immigration in the HouseCNN’s Dana Bash Tom Cohen Ted Barrett and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report",0

221,"The father of the former NSA contractor who leaked details of the government's massive Internet- and phone-tracking programs made an impassioned plea to his son to stop leaking telling Fox News that ""I hope I pray"" he does not do anything considered treasonous.Lon Snowden spoke at length with Fox News about his son Edward's decision to leak sensitive security details about U.S. intelligence-gathering operations. While defending his son's integrity and criticizing the government he pleaded with his son -- who is thought to be weathering the political storm from a location in Hong Kong -- to return home and not to leak more information.""I hope I pray and I ask that you will not release any secrets that could constitute treason"" Snowden told Fox News in a message meant for his son's ears. He added: ""I sense that you're under much stress [from] what I've read recently and [ask] that you not succumb to that stress ... and make a bad decision.""Further Snowden said he would rather see his son return to the U.S. and face the U.S. justice system than stay abroad.""I would like to see Ed come home and face this. I shared that with the government when I spoke with them. I love my son"" he told Fox News' Eric Bolling.Snowden claimed there are some people who want him to ""cross that line and do something that constitutes treason or they would like to see him disappear."" But Snowden said he's sure ""that the moment he landed that there would be a line of attorneys waiting to defend him.""Edward Snowden himself did not voice that level of confidence. During a live online chat hosted by Guardian.com on Monday Snowden said he doesn't think he would receive a fair trial in the U.S.""The U.S. Government just as they did with other whistle-blowers immediately and predictably destroyed any possibility of a fair trial at home openly declaring me guilty of treason and that the disclosure of secret criminal and even unconstitutional acts is an unforgivable crime. That's not justice and it would be foolish to volunteer yourself to it if you can do more good outside of prison than in it"" he said during the chat.Snowden also claimed he did not reveal any U.S. operations against ""legitimate military targets"" but rather NSA efforts against ""civilian infrastructure.""Snowden has emerged at the center of one of the biggest security leaks in U.S. history. After The Guardian news organization and Washington Post reported on government programs that monitor massive troves of phone and Internet records Snowden was revealed as the source of that information. According to The Guardian Snowden continues to provide sensitive information -- The Guardian most recently reported on a British effort to hack into foreign diplomats' phones and emails during conferences citing Snowden as the source.Snowden could face serious charges if he returns to the U.S. Former Vice President Dick Cheney called Snowden a ""traitor"" on ""Fox News Sunday.""But others have praised his decision to come forward citing the civil liberties at stake.Lon Snowden said he was ""saddened"" by his son's decision but criticized the government for the surveillance efforts his son helped expose.""Some people are suggesting that what's occurring is very similar to every morning the government walks up to your mailbox or afternoon. They pull the envelopes out. They open them. They look at your mail. They copy it. They archive it in case they wanna look at it sometime in the future in case you do something wrong sometime in the future. They re-seal the envelopes they put them back in your mailbox. And they do it every day over and over and over again.""He continued: ""I don't want them reading my email. ... If we say ""Oh my gosh we're going to have to ... sacrifice our freedoms because of the threat of terrorism' well the terrorists have already won because it's our freedoms that make us Americans.""He said he's concerned his son is ""in peril"" but voiced confidence that if he returns to the U.S. that would be best.""I have faith in our justice system applied correctly absolutely. You know I would rather my son be a prisoner in the U.S. than a free man in a country that did not have ... the freedoms that are protected"" in the U.S. he said.He complained there are a lot of misconceptions about his son including speculation about why he chose to stay in Hong Kong. Snowden said his son was simply ""comfortable"" there and with Asian culture in general since he used to live in Japan.As for media reports that he's a high-school dropout he explained that his son actually had an illness during his sophomore year -- likely mono. But after he dropped out he said his son completed his high-school equivalency and went on to take college courses.He said he last saw his son on April 4. ""We'd gone out to dinner"" he said adding that his son seemed to be carrying a ""burden.""""We hugged as we always do. He said 'I love you Dad.' I said 'I love you Ed.' And I expected to see him -- see him again"" Snowden recalled.Fox News' Eric Bolling contributed to this report.",1
222,A Republican congressman I bet.A Republican congressman I bet.With the House dragging its feet on immigration vexed by internal GOP infighting on how to proceed supporters of reform want to force the House to act and they've zeroed in on the discharge petition as the means to that end.A discharge petition means that if a majority of the House demands a vote the vote will take place. And since it's widely acknowledged that there are more than enough votes in the House to pass the Senate bill all you'd have to do is get those pro-reform Republicans to join Democrats in signing the discharge petition to make it happen.Some Democrats are afraid that pushing a discharge petition could upset delicate bipartisan negotiations currently underway in the House. Others note that it's the best way to publicly put recalcitrant members on the record on the issue of immigration. And it's true! Absent a vote clearly feared by the xenophobes the discharge petition forces individual members to publicly state whether they are for or against reform. Let fast-growing immigrant communities know exactly where the obstruction is coming from.But don't get your hopes up. Even if a full-throated discharge petition campaign were launched few if any Republicans would likely sign on. In essence any Republican signatories would be ceding control of the chamber to the minority party and you better believe the Republican leadership would severely punish any member that signed on.So as a tool to actually pass a bill a discharge petition would be as effective as House Speaker John Boehner's leadership style. That is not effective at all. But as a tool to further pressure and embarrass Republicans? It would certainly work and it would provide yet another news hook for Spanish-language media to keep pounding on Republicans.Because right now that's the only tactic reform proponents have left—try and embarrass Republicans into taking an action they'd clearly rather avoid.Sign our petition urging U.S. House members to bring comprehensive immigration reform to a floor vote with or without Speaker Boehner.,1
223,"SAN JOSE Calif. (AP) — House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has disappointed some of her liberal base with her defense of the Obama administration's classified surveillance of U.S. residents' phone and Internet records.Some of the activists attending the annual Netroots Nation political conference Saturday booed and interrupted the San Francisco Democrat when she commented on the surveillance programs carried out by the National Security Agency and revealed by a former contractor Edward Snowden The San Jose Mercury News reports (http://bit.ly/19fB6U4).The boos came when Pelosi said that Snowden had violated the law and that the government needed to strike a balance between security and privacy.As she was attempting to argue that Obama's approach to citizen surveillance was an improvement over the policies under President George W. Bush an activist identified by the Mercury News as Marc Perkel of Gilroy stood up and tried loudly to question her prompting security guards to escort him out of the convention hall.""Leave him alone!"" audience members shouted. Others yelled ""Secrets and lies!"" ''No secret courts!"" and ""Protect the First Amendment!"" according to the Mercury News.Perkel told the newspaper that he thinks Pelosi does not fully understand what the NSA is up to.Several others in the audience walked out in support of Perkel.""We're listening to our progressive leaders who are supposed to be on our side of the team saying it's OK for us to get targeted"" for online surveillance said Jana Thrift of Eugene Ore. ""It's crazy. I don't know who Nancy Pelosi really is.""Netroots Nation is an organizing and training convention for progressive political leaders. Pelosi was Saturday's keynote speaker at the event which opened Thursday at the San Jose Convention Center and was scheduled to conclude Sunday.Her remarks criticizing the Republican majority in the House and encouraging powerful women brought applause cheers and laughs.",1
224,Apparently no espionage tool that Congress gives the National Security Agency is big enough or intrusive enough to satisfy the agency’s inexhaustible appetite for delving into the communications of Americans. Time and again the N.S.A. has pushed past the limits that lawmakers thought they had imposed to prevent it from invading basic privacy as guaranteed by the Constitution.It was bad enough in 2008 when Congress allowed the agency to spy without a warrant on e-mails and text messages between Americans and foreign targets of an investigation. That already strained the Fourth Amendment’s protections against illegal searches but lawmakers decided it was justified as part of a terror investigation.It turns out as Charlie Savage revealed in The Times on Thursday that the N.S.A. went far beyond those boundaries. Instead it copies virtually all overseas messages that Americans send or receive then scans them to see if they contain any references to people or subjects the agency thinks might have a link to terrorists.That could very well include innocent communications between family members expressing fears of a terror attack. Or messages between an editor and a reporter who is covering international security issues. Or the privileged conversation between a lawyer and a client who is being investigated.,1
225,"The immigration status of the Boston bombings suspects may become a stumbling block for a new bill that seeks to legalize nearly 11 million immigrants and increase the number of legal immigrants to the United States.Opponents of the bill—which was crafted by a bipartisan ""Gang of Eight"" in the Senate—and even some supporters say the process of reforming the country's immigration system should be stalled until all the facts about the suspects' interactions with the immigration system are known.Both Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev the two brothers accused of the Boston Marathon bombings emigrated to the United States legally from Russia as refugees a decade ago when they were children. The Tsarnaev family which is ethnically Chechen was granted asylum because it feared persecution in its home country according to media reports.Tamerlan's application for citizenship was put on hold in 2012 by the government because he had been questioned by the FBI at the request of the Russian government for possible ties to Chechen terrorism the New York Times reported. Dzhokhar's citizenship application was approved and he naturalized in 2012.At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing over the bill on Tuesday Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano defended immigration officials' handling of the Tsarnaevs saying the process for granting asylum is rigorous.""In the past four years we have increased both the number and the coverage of the vetting that goes on"" Napolitano said. As things currently stand she noted those who seek asylum must go through multiple screening interviews and submit biometric data to be checked across government databases. If granted asylum and legal status immigrants must go through two more interviews if they want to become citizens when they become eligible five years later.(Asylum applicants must show that they face government-sanctioned persecution in their home country stemming from their race religion nationality political views or membership in a particular social group.)Story continuesNapolitano argued that the immigration reform bill would make the country safer because the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country would be brought ""out of the shadows"" and screened. The bill requires immigrants to pass a background check before they are eligible for temporary legal status. They must pay fines and back taxes and enroll in English classes to gain permanent legal status.Opponents of the immigration bill have argued that the Tsarnaevs' alleged crime suggests that the current immigration system is unable to weed out potential terrorists and that the process of crafting the bill should be slowed down to address that. If the bill is stalled until next fall opponents hope it will be close enough to the next election that on-the-fence lawmakers will withdraw their support effectively killing the bill. President Barack Obama has said he hopes the bill will pass this summer.Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach one of the most prominent opponents of legalizing immigrants said at Monday's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that the legalization process in the bill could present a national security threat.""The background checks in this bill are insufficient from preventing a terrorist from getting amnesty"" Kobach said.Supporters of the immigration reform bill say the argument is a specious excuse to delay the legislation.""Unless we are able to design an immigration background check that can get into the minds of people and predict the future then we won't be able to solve problems like this through immigration screening alone"" said Lynn Tramonte of America's Voice a pro-immigration advocacy group.It's also unclear how the immigration system could have known what two children seeking asylum with their family would do 10 years later.But even some lawmakers who have indicated their support for the bill have raised concern about the Boston suspects.Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky who has been a vocal supporter of immigration reform wrote in a letter to Majority Leader Harry Reid that the immigration reform process should stop until all the facts are known about the intersection between the immigration system and the Tsarnaev brothers.""Why did the current system allow two individuals to immigrate to the United States from the Chechen Republic in Russia an area known as a hotbed of Islamic extremism who then committed acts of terrorism? Were there any safeguards? Could this have been prevented? Does the immigration reform before us address this?"" Paul asked.He said Congress should debate whether immigrants from ""high-risk"" nations should face more ""scrutiny"" and whether student visas for people from certain ""high-risk"" countries altogether should be discontinued.Sen. Dan Coats R-Ind. said on ABC on Sunday that he hopes lawmakers will put the immigration debate ""on hold"" because of the bombing.Roy Beck of NumbersUSA a group that opposes illegal immigration and wants to dramatically lower rates of legal immigration said he thinks it's significant that Paul and Coats have called for slowing down the bill.""The Boston bombing gives them a little more of a public reason to try to get this to slow down"" Beck said.If the bill is delayed until the fall Republicans and red-state Democrats might think it is too close to election season to support it Beck predicts.",0
226,WASHINGTON — While much of the debate over immigration has focused on the fate of the estimated 11 million people in the U.S. without legal authorization one of the biggest immediate impacts of the reform bill being prepared in the Senate would be a sudden large surge in legal migration.The U.S. admits about 1 million legal immigrants per year more than any other country. That number could jump by more than 50% over the next decade under the terms of the immigration reform bill that a bipartisan group of senators expects to unveil as early as Tuesday. The impact would be felt nationwide but areas that already have large immigrant communities would probably see much of the increase.AdvertisementThe immigration package includes at least four major provisions that would increase the number of legal immigrants according to people familiar with it. Some of the parts could generate as much controversy as the provisions dealing with those who enter the country illegally or overstay their visas according to those with long experience of the politics of immigration.PHOTOS: The immigration reform debateAdvertisementSupporters say that higher levels of legal immigration would meet the U.S. need for certain kinds of workers. Increased legal migration also would reduce most of the incentive for illegal border crossings backers of the plan say and would allow border agents to focus on smugglers and people with violent criminal records.Opponents such as Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) who has long opposed measures to increase immigration levels say new workers would depress wages and crowd out Americans looking for work during a time of persistently high unemployment.Advertisement“The masters of the universe in glass towers and suites they may not be impacted by this but millions of struggling American families will” Sessions said in an interview Friday. “We do need to be sure we aren’t exacerbating unemployment and wage erosion in America.”The surge would come in several ways: The bill aims to eliminate the current backlog of roughly 4 million people waiting to be reunited with family members in the U.S. The 11 million now in the country without legal authorization would be eligible for citizenship only after that backlog was resolved. Reunification efforts would require boosting the number of visas issued each year. To keep the additional inflow under control the bill would stop allowing adult siblings of immigrants to qualify but children and parents would continue to be eligible.AdvertisementU.S. immigration law: Decades of debateIn addition to family unification which allows people into the country permanently the bill also aims to increase temporary visas for both high-wage and low-wage workers. The number of visas for high-tech workers could nearly double to more than 120000 per year. At the other end of the wage scale a new visa system would allow businesses to bring in workers for jobs including janitors housekeepers and meatpackers. The numbers would start small but as the unemployment rate declined it could reach 200000 a year by the end of the decade. And growers could bring a total of about 330000 new farmworkers into the country during the decade. At least some of those low-wage temporary workers eventually would be allowed to seek permanent residency.AdvertisementThe bill’s authors expect that legal immigration eventually would decline again but only 10 years after the bill passed once the backlog of residency applications shrank.“The increased number in the years following the enactment of this bill reflects us having to clean up what has been a broken immigration system for many years” said Angela Kelley an immigration expert at the Center for American Progress a liberal policy group in Washington.Advertisement“We had too few visas for too long” Kelley said. “Congress hasn’t upgraded our immigration system in 23 years.”The last time Congress overhauled the admissions process for immigrants was the Immigration Act of 1990. In the years after the bill’s passage the total number of legal immigrants increased by 40% from about 500000 per year to more than 700000.AdvertisementBut the new system didn’t allow enough flexibility as the U.S. continued to shift from a manufacturing-based economy to a knowledge-based economy said Audrey Singer immigration policy expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington.“How do we get this right?” Singer asked. “The question is can we come up with a mechanism that allows us to have a more adjustable system over time and have more flexibility?”AdvertisementIn theory legal immigration has broad public support in both parties. In practice changes to the immigration system can generate fierce political opposition.Limiting the ability of immigrants to bring their adult siblings to the U.S. would be controversial particularly with Asian American lawmakers and their constituents. Asian Americans use that category more heavily than other immigrant groups. The bill also would limit visas for married sons and daughters of U.S. citizens to people under the age of 30 which could generate opposition. On the other hand the bill would allow lawful permanent residents to sponsor spouses and minor children for green cards. Currently only U.S. citizens can do that. That change likely to please immigrant groups could bring in an additional 800000 people over the next 10 years Senate aides said.AdvertisementHouse Republican leaders have been meeting with members to discuss immigration and the future flow of legal immigrants has been among the top issues raised according to officials familiar with the sessions. Because of the way many congressional district boundaries were redrawn after the 2010 census few Republicans have large immigrant communities among their constituents leaving many newer lawmakers unfamiliar with the issues.“Everybody’s all over the map” said Rep. James Lankford (R-Okla.) who has been helping coordinate the sessions for the GOP leadership. “There’s an economic benefit” to the changes being contemplated “if we have the right formula set up” he said. “It’s people who are coming in for economic benefit rather than just family connection.”AdvertisementFULL COVERAGE: U.S. immigration newsConvincing reluctant Republicans of the economic benefits of legal immigration has become easier with the support of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce some in the GOP said. Business owners have lobbied Republicans recounting stories about their struggles to find workers for certain types of jobs.AdvertisementJonathan Johnson president of the bargain site Overstock.com based in Salt Lake City said his firm had struggled to hire enough computer programmers and software developers to expand the business.“We pay more and they are still hard to fill” he said.Advertisement“We need to be more free in letting people in” Johnson said. “That helps us solve our border problem.

228,Liberals and labor leaders hailed Mr. Perez calling him a champion for workers and those who have faced discrimination. “At a time when our politics tilts so heavily toward corporations and the very wealthy our country needs leaders like Tom Perez to champion the cause of ordinary working people” said Richard L. Trumka president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.James P. Hoffa general president of the Teamsters called Mr. Perez “the right choice” because of his history of advocacy. “In these difficult economic times” Mr. Hoffa said “workers need a fighter at the Labor Department who will stand up for them and they are getting just that with Thomas Perez.”While at the Justice Department Mr. Perez has pursued a record number of discrimination or brutality claims against local police and sheriff’s departments including that of Joe Arpaio the outspoken sheriff in Maricopa County Ariz. who was accused of “a pattern of unlawful discrimination” against Latinos.Mr. Perez also challenged voter identification requirements imposed by South Carolina and Texas and his division reached the three largest residential fair lending settlements in the history of the Fair Housing Act. Under him the voting section participated in the most new litigation in the last fiscal year than in any previous year.He has spent a career fighting discrimination cases as a federal prosecutor then under President Bill Clinton as deputy chief of the Civil Rights Division and finally as head of civil rights enforcement at the Health and Human Services Department. Mr. Perez also served as an elected council member in Montgomery County Md. and as the state’s secretary of labor licensing and regulation.Though his father died when he was 12 his family pressed the value of education so much that all four of his siblings became doctors. Mr. Perez 51 graduated from Brown University and Harvard Law School.“My parents taught my four siblings and me to work hard to give back to our community and to make sure that the ladder of opportunity was there for those coming after us” Mr. Perez said at the White House on Monday as he addressed the crowd in both English and Spanish. “Over my career I’ve learned that true progress is possible if you keep an open mind listen to all sides and focus on results.”,0

230,“We are the ones we’ve been waiting for. We are the change we seek” candidate Barack Obama said in 2008. At the time his comments came in for criticism: They were narcissistic; they were tautological; they didn’t make a whole lot of sense.But in the aftermath of Obama’s 2012 reelection and his second inaugural address his 2008 remarks seem less a statement of self-absorption than one of prophecy. There is an Obama majority in American politics symbolized by Monday’s throng on the Mall whose existence is both the consequence of profound changes to our nation’s composition and values and the cause of changes yet to come.That majority as the president made clear in his remarks would not exist but for Americans’ struggles to expand our foundational belief in the equality of all men. The drive to expand equality he said in his speech’s most historically resonant line “is the star that guides us still just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall.”Our history Obama argued is one of adapting our ideals to a changing world. His speech (like recent books by Michael Lind and my Post colleague E.J. Dionne Jr.) reclaimed U.S. history from the misrepresentations of both constitutional originalists and libertarian fantasists. “Fidelity to our founding principles requires new responses to new challenges” the president said. “Preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action. For the American people can no more meet the demands of today’s world by acting alone than American soldiers could have met the forces of fascism or communism with muskets and militias.”Having established that the moral and practical arc of U.S. history bends toward equality Obama vowed to push his demands for equality still further — to ending the systemic underpayment of female workers; the voter suppression that compels some Americans usually minorities to wait hours to cast their votes; the deportations of immigrants who would otherwise help build the economy; and the laws that forbid gay Americans to marry.1 of 68 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Obama View Photos A collection of cartoons of the president. Caption A collection of cartoons of the president. Wait 1 second to continue.As the president acknowledged however social equality is rising even as the relative economic equality that once defined American life has sharply and broadly receded. “Our country cannot succeed” he said “when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it.” For this Obama prescribed revamping our taxes and reforming our schools but these are by no means sufficient to transform our nation into one that as the president put it “rewards the effort and determination of every single American.” The waning of the middle class is with climate change the most vexing item on the president’s agenda and requires far-reaching solutions beyond any he laid out. U.S. workers must regain the power they once had to bargain for their wages but that only begins the list of economic reforms that are as difficult to achieve as they are necessary to re-create an financially vibrant nation.The president closed his speech by asking his supporters to join him to help “shape the debates of our time.” The biggest mistake Obama made when he took office was to effectively disband the organization of the millions of Americans who had worked for his election — for fear in part that it might upset members of Congress whose votes he would need for his policies. He wants no such unilateral political disarmament now; his operatives hope to keep his 2012 campaign’s volunteer army in the field for the legislative battles ahead. Obama’s legions have proven that they can win elections and this matters a great deal more the president has learned than whatever trace elements of goodwill he may win by deferring to Congress.The Obama Majority — its existence and mobilization — is what enabled the president to deliver so ideological an address. No such inaugural speech has been delivered since Ronald Reagan took office in 1981 demanding the curtailment of government programs and secure in the knowledge that much of the white working class had shifted its allegiance away from the Democrats and supported his attack on the public sector and minority rights. On Monday Obama secure in the knowledge that the nation’s minorities had joined with other liberal constituencies to form a new governing coalition voiced their demands to ensure equality and to preserve and expand the government’s efforts to meet the nation’s challenges. As he left the stage he stopped and turned to marvel at the crowd at the new American majority they represented. They were the ones he and we were waiting for.Read more from Harold Meyerson’s archive or follow him on Twitter.,0

Plaintiff Sundus Shaker Saleh an Iraqi single mother and refugee now living in Jordan filed a complaint in March 2013 in San Francisco federal court alleging that the planning and waging of the war constituted a “crime of aggression” against Iraq a legal theory that was used by the Nuremberg Tribunal to convict Nazi war criminals after World War II.Saleh's suit alleges that President Bush and his administration falsified pretenses for the war failed to get international approval and began planning for the possibility of an invasion before 2000.However the Obama administration would like to shield the ex-President and his officials from such prosecution arguing that everything done was performed within the scope of their various governmental roles.Meanwhile Bradley Manning – now Chelsea Manning – will be spending 35 years in prison for exposing U.S. war crimes.Crimes Bush Cheney Rumsfeld and their ilk helped choreograph.Follow @David_EHG,1
233,"The McDonald's Coffee Case is certainly the poster child for the idea that we are awash in frivolous cases. I discussed the truth about the McDonald's Coffee Case last year. Click on that link and read about it and then come back or take a look at it later.Consider if there were an onslaught of frivolous lawsuits crowding our dockets wouldn't you expect judges to be aware of the problem and even active in demanding a solution to the problem? Who better to know what a case is really about and whether it is frivolous or notl?In fact there is a study that asked judges about this issue conducted by the Federal Judicial Center. Never heard of the Federal Judicial Center? Well here is a description:The Federal Judicial Center is the research and education agency of the federal judicial system. It was established by Congress in 1967 (28 U.S.C. §§ 620-629) on the recommendation of the Judicial Conference of the United States. The many specific statutory duties of the Center and its Board fall into a few broad categories: o conducting and promoting orientation and continuing education and training for federal judges court employees and others;o developing recommendations about the operation and study of the federal courts;o conducting and promoting research on federal judicial procedures court operations and history. By statute the Chief Justice of the United States chairs the Center's Board which also includes the director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts and seven judges elected by the Judicial Conference.Hardly folks who could be called wild-eyed radicals.In 2005 they issued a report on sanctionable behavior and that includes the filing of frivolous lawsuits: Report of a Survey of United States District Judges' Experiences and Views Concerning Rule 11 Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by David Rauma & Thomas E. WillgingThe study - a survey of most of the federal judges - was performed because many were claiming that frivolous lawsuits were common and that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure R. 11 needed to be beefed up. Rule 11 provides for sanctions for litigants lawyers and lawfirms who file suits where they have not done reasonable investigation into the facts and law and where there is not factual and legal support for their filings. Or as the study describes Rule 11.As currently written Rule 11 expressly authorizes judges to impose sanctions on lawyers and parties who present to a district court a pleading written motion or other paper without reasonable support in fact or law or for an improper purpose such as to cause unnecessary cost or delay. Rule 11 provides that sanctions for violations are within the judge's discretion; that a party should have a period of time a ""safe harbor"" within which to withdraw or correct a filing alleged to violate Rule 11; and that Rule 11's primary purpose is to deter future violations and not necessarily to compensate the opposing party for losses including attorney fees.Here is the study abstract:A report of the results of a survey completed by 278 of 400 (70%) federal district judges in the winter of 2004-05. The Center conducted the study at the request of the Judicial Conference's Advisory Committee on Civil Rules. A questionnaire elicited the judges' experiences and opinions about the merits of past and current versions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 and about a legislative proposal to modify Rule 11. The judges expressed a strong preference for Rule 11 in its current form.The study asked judges whether frivolous lawsuits were a problem. The overwhelming majority said no.The views of judges who responded to the survey are likely to be related to their estimation of the amount of groundless civil litigation they see in their own docket especially when focusing on cases where the plaintiff is represented by counsel. Approximately 85% of the district judges view groundless litigation in such cases as no more than a small problem and another 12% see such litigation as a moderate problem. About 3% view groundless litigation brought by plaintiffs who are represented by counsel as a large or very large problem. For 54% of the judges who responded the amount of groundless litigation has remained relatively constant during their tenure on the federal bench. Only 7% indicated that the problem is now larger. For 19% the amount of groundless civil litigation has decreased during their tenure on the federal bench and for 12% there has never been a problem.What is most interesting is that judges appointed more recently feel that way most strongly.The overwhelming result was that Rule 11 sanctions should not be amended to be made harsher. Here are the more detailed results:More than 80% of the 278 district judges indicated that ""Rule 11 is needed and it is just right as it now stands."" In evaluating the alternatives 87% of the respondents preferred the current Rule 11 5% preferred the version in effect between 1983 and 1993 and 4% preferred the version proposed in H.R. 4571. Judges' opinions about specific provisions in Rule 11 and the proposed legislation followed a similar pattern. The results indicated that relatively large majorities of the judges who responded to our survey have the following views about Rule 11: * 85% strongly or moderately support Rule 11's safe harbor provision; * 91% oppose the proposed requirement that sanctions be imposed for every Rule 11 violation; * 84% disagree with the proposition that an award of attorney fees should be mandatory for every Rule 11 violation.Unfortunately I cannot provide a link that gets you directly to the study. You can find it by going here and doing a search for sanctions.",1

237,Maybe I shouldn't be surprised that anyone would think this in this country much less say it aloud but here it is:How can conservatives adjust their strategy to appeal more strongly to the single female society? Well one obvious approach would be restricting the vote to people who are married.Now I'm not quite sure how that's supposed to appeal to single women. It seems to me that if you just go ahead and disenfranchise single women (or blacks or Latinos or poor people or people who don't drive for whatever reason) well then that solves your problem right there. No need to have policies or platforms that appeal to people who can't vote right? So it's kind of illogical on its face. But it's also just mind-bogglingly bizarro as well.A couple of quotes from the comments:The goal of the GOP should be to resist urbanization not just because of the voting trends but because urban life leads to a lower standard of living.Speaking as someone with a paid off mortgage I still oppose the idea of property owners being the cut point. Taxpayer is a perfectly good one. Best would be to first seize the vocabulary change out 'entitlement' for 'public charity.' Then anyone who declares themselves destitute and in need of public charity would be a lot easier to drop from the voter rolls. They would have declared themselves incapable of maintaining themselves; why do they get to tell the rest of us how to run the country if they can't take care of themselves?So people who live in cities shouldn't vote either I guess?I knew about only allowing property owners to vote...Now my little diary doesn't explore the author's myriad reasons why single women are the problem but here's his opening generalization:The single female demographic doesn’t get hung up on details. Another of the new liberal icons Wendy Davis of Texas couldn’t answer basic questions about the abortion legislation she opposed with a purportedly heroic filibuster. Now she’s claiming she is actually kinda sorta “pro life” when you think about it. This is true of all the emotional appeals directed at single female society – lack of knowledge is not only overshadowed by passionate conviction it can be a point of pride.I was mainly just impressed by how much Red State conservatives don't want people to vote to the point where disenfranchisement is a Serious Discussion.I can only conclude that it's because what Kos always says about our base if our people vote WE WIN.Thanks for listening.

238,The tea party returned to Capitol Hill on Wednesday but this time the don’t-tread-on-me crowd trod upon one of its own.Much of the scene was familiar: the yellow flags the banners protesting tyranny and socialism the demands to impeach President Obama and to repeal Obamacare. But there was a new target of the conservatives’ ire: Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and his “amnesty” plan for illegal immigrants. The loathing of this onetime darling of the movement — Rubio rode the tea party wave to office in 2010 — could be seen in the homemade signs on the East Lawn of the Capitol proclaiming “Rubio RINO” (Republican In Name Only) and “Rubio Lies Americans Die.” Rubio antagonism became a main theme of the event held by Republican Reps. Steve King (Iowa) Louie Gohmert (Tex.) Michele Bachmann (Minn.) and other opponents of the bipartisan Senate immigration legislation that Rubio negotiated.The lawmakers called to the microphone the Heritage Foundation’s Robert Rector who delivered a sustained rebuke of the turncoat. “Marco Rubio” he charged “has not read his own bill.”A chorus of boos rose from the crowd of several hundred.Rector mocked the claim that the legislation wouldn’t cost taxpayers money.1 of 156 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × The best editorial cartoons of 2013 (so far) View Photos A collection of cartoons from around the country.

Caption A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Tom Toles Wait 1 second to continue.The speed with which the tea party turned on Rubio is stunning beginning earlier this year with complaints from conservative commentators and now open mockery at a Capitol Hill rally. House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) declared this week that the House won’t take up an immigration bill that doesn’t have majority support in the Republican caucus which means the “Gang of Eight” Senate bill that Rubio sponsored wouldn’t get a vote.The immigration event was essentially a bid by the lawmakers to hijack the crowd of about 1000 (respectable if a faint echo of the 2009 and 2010 crowds) that was already assembling at the Capitol on Wednesday for a tea party rally against the IRS on the other side of the building. Calling their event a rally might have been too obvious a theft so the lawmakers staged an all-day “press conference” (which had the benefit of less-stringent permitting requirements).This was a news conference unlike any other. It ran from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (with a two-hour break to minimize overlap with the other rally) began with a prayer included chants of “USA! USA!” and featured politicians holding babies onstage. In the audience a sea of homemade signs announced “Legalized = Invasion” and “The Melting Pot Floweth Over” and “Exporting Illegals = Importing Jobs for Americans” and “God Will Take Care of Them There: Close the Borders.”The few reporters who did pose questions during the extravaganza were cheered or booed based on their employers: an extended ovation for a reporter from the conservative Breitbart News Web site jeers for Lisa Desjardins of CNN and cascading boos for a Huffington Post reporter.The gimmick was a big draw luring so many from the IRS protest that Capitol Police complained of a crowding problem for the supposed news conference. Gohmert rallied opposition to Boehner saying the speaker’s assurances to conservatives on immigration leave room for “a betrayal.”“Get rid of him!” people shouted from the crowd.Bachmann further stirred up the activists by telling them that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) is accelerating a vote on the legislation because of “falling support for the Gang of Eight immigration reform bill.”But the press-conference format and the shortage of reporters willing to play along created an open-mike situation. A man claiming to be from the Pittsburgh tea party asked about “the illegal people” and whether the government could find out “who they’re calling back in their home countries and to whom they’re sending money American money.”Heritage’s Rector fielded that question. “I regard my vote as something like a property right” he said “and when you give it out willy-nilly and freely to people whose claim on that property right is that they broke our laws I feel deeply insulted. And I say ‘You stole from me!’ ”The cheers that followed could be heard clearly on the Senate side of the Capitol.Twitter: @MilbankRead more from Dana Milbank’s archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.,0
239,"Of all the commentators who have been asking whether King’s dream has been achieved FOX News’ Juan Williams seems to be the only one with whom I agree.

241,Now the immigration debate is really getting juicy.Rep. Steve King an Iowa Republican has always been a bit of a melon head but he outdid himself in an interview that came to light this week in which he described “DREAMers” — people brought to this country illegally as children — as misshapen drug mules. “For every one who’s a valedictorian there’s another 100 out there that — they weigh 130 pounds and they’ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they’re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert” the honorable gentleman said.Cantaloupe calves? This was a rotten tomato tossed at Latinos who were already suspicious of Republicans before the insult was added to the injury of House conservatives such as King blocking action on bipartisan immigration legislation.“Hateful” said House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio).“Inexcusable” said Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.).1 of 171 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Republicans View Photos A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Caption A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Tom Toles Wait 1 second to continue.King kept on throwing. “It’s not something that I’m making up” he told Radio Iowa on Tuesday evening hours after a Democrat who had discovered the recent interview with Newsmax read the offending comments aloud at a congressional hearing. “We have people that are mules that are drug mules that are hauling drugs across the border and you can tell by their physical characteristics what they’ve been doing for months going through the desert with 75 pounds of drugs on their back. And if those who advocate for the DREAM Act if they choose to characterize this about valedictorians I gave them a different image.”King certainly gave his colleagues a different image: that of a Republican Party driven into extinction in coming decades because it antagonized what is becoming the most important voting bloc. Even his usual conservative partners moved to isolate him.“Irresponsible and reprehensible” Rep. Raul Labrador (Idaho) said at a luncheon gathering with reporters called Conversations with Conservatives. “I think what he said was out of touch with the [GOP] conference.”In lieu of a defense of King Labrador scolded the assembled journalists for their reporting on King’s out-of-his-gourd remark but not the favorable things other Republicans say about immigrants. “Shame on you. Shame on the media” he lectured. “Make sure that your article talks about what every Republican said” Labrador proposed “not what one outlier said.”This is similar to scolding the media for focusing on the one plane that crashes and not giving equal attention to all the planes that land safely. More to the point it’s not at all clear that King is such an outlier.Certainly his zany remarks are low-hanging fruit for journalists. Just last week he got into a heated exchange with a Univision host who asked about a speech in which King likened immigrants to a litter of puppies. “You want a good bird dog?” he asked. “Pick the one that’s the friskiest. . . . You get the pick of the litter and you got yourself a pretty good bird dog. Well we’ve got the pick of every donor civilization on the planet.”But if Republicans think King is a fruitcake they don’t show it on the House floor where last month they approved along party lines an amendment King offered that would force the Obama administration to resume deportation of the DREAMers who immigrated as children. “If this position holds no amnesty will reach the president’s desk” the congressman said in a celebratory statement after the vote.1 of 171 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Republicans View Photos A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Caption A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Tom Toles Wait 1 second to continue.And King’s position is holding. Boehner responding to House conservatives is refusing to take up the Senate legislation. Because he has chosen a strategy of passing legislation through the House without Democratic votes the speaker can’t afford to lose more than a handful of Republicans. This empowers “outliers” such as King.“The reason we’re in a bottleneck here in Congress is because of a few like him” Rep. Rubén Hinojosa (D-Tex.) chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus told me Wednesday afternoon at a caucus event outside the Capitol. “Evidently there’s enough to be able to force the speaker of the House to stall and not be able to do this immigration reform.”Republicans say their objections to the immigration bill have nothing to do with racial or ethnic discrimination and that’s surely the case for most of them. But King makes it easy for Democrats to tar the Republicans with sinister motives. Rep. Ben Luján (D-N.M.) one of several speakers denouncing King on the House floor Wednesday said his slur shows why “the American people continue to see House Republicans as out of touch.”That’s not quite fair. But when one of their own is talking about cantaloupe calves Republicans aren’t in a strong position to complain about cherry-picking.Twitter: @MilbankRead more from Dana Milbank’s archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.,0
242,"In a Capitol Hill hallway leading to the Senate floor on Tuesday Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid had just finished telling reporters that no Republican would delay a vote to fund the government. But then Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz carrying a stack of papers under his arm strolled past him toward the door of the chamber.Cruz turned his head toward the gaggle of reporters around Reid and walked through the doors onto the floor where he stopped at his desk on the far-right corner of the room.“I intend to speak about defunding Obamacare until I am unable to stand” he declared.With his colleague Utah Sen. Mike Lee on his left and an aide on his right Cruz began what is expected to be an hourslong speech that could last late into the night about the importance of gutting the federal health care law that President Barack Obama signed in 2010.Cruz’s move has all the looks of an old-fashioned filibuster but it’s technically just a very long speech that will draw attention and focus to his cause. In this case he will be delaying a vote on a bill to fund the government that when the Democrat-controlled Senate is finished with it will include funding for the health care law but he won't derail it. According to Reid's spokesman Adam Jentleson Cruz ""negotiated the terms"" of his speech with the Democratic majority leader before taking the floor.Congress must approve a bill that sets federal spending rates by Oct. 1 or the government will shut down. For months Cruz and a small group of conservative Republicans have called on their party to refuse to fund the government unless spending on the president's signature domestic policy win is stripped even if it means shutting down the government.Among Republicans in the upper chamber there aren't many takers.At about the same time that Cruz began his speech Senate Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell who doesn’t support the Texas lawmaker's filibuster-esque strategy voiced clear disapproval with the delay tactic. Without Cruz’s objection Senate Republicans could have given up their time to debate the funding bill which would have sped up the voting process.Story continuesBecause Cruz chose to use up most of that time the Senate won’t be able to return its version of the funding bill back to the House until Sunday night — just a day before the shutdown deadline — eliminating the leverage House Republicans might have had in the debate.“It would be to the advantage to our colleagues in the House who are in the majority to shorten the process and if the majority leader were to ask us to shorten the process I would not object” McConnell told reporters in the first moments of Cruz’s speech. “I don’t know who else in the conference may feel differently. But I do know that if the House doesn’t get what we send over until Monday they’re in a pretty tough spot.”When House lawmakers return to Capitol Hill that day they will be asked to vote on what the Senate has sent them: a government spending bill that includes funding for Obamacare. They will have a choice to whether pass the bill as is or change it and send it back to the Senate and risk a shutdown.If the bar for success is actually defunding Obamacare Cruz's effort is almost sure to fail. Senate Democrats and the president have made clear they will not approve any legislation that defunds the law even if it means bringing the nation to the brink of a shutdown.But that’s really not the point.By making himself into a stalwart on the issue who is at odds with members of his own party on the approach Cruz is setting himself up to be a hero of the party’s conservative base who want lawmakers to eliminate the health care law at all costs.To that end Cruz’s exercise will be a success.",1
243,"Story highlights Ruben Navarrette: Rep. Don Young used an ethnic slur to describe Mexican immigrants Navarrette: The ""w-word"" is just as offensive as the ""n-word"" and yet it's still being used He says political opportunism is alive and well as liberals pounced on Young Navarrette: Politicians aren't the only ones who cross the line in using loaded termsEditor’s Note: Ruben Navarrette Jr. is a CNN contributor and a nationally syndicated columnist with the Washington Post Writers Group. Follow him on Twitter: @rubennavarrette.(CNN) —In a recent interview on Ketchikan Public Radio in Alaska Rep. Don Young the state’s only congressman offered this unhelpful tidbit:“My father had a ranch; we used to have 50-60 wet—- to pick tomatoes. It takes two people to pick the same tomatoes now. It’s all done by machine.”There it is – the equivalent of what Groucho Marx used to call “the secret word.” It’s a word that is so offensive that I won’t say or write it in the long form – although many people do so freely which is a problem.Just as Americans have been conditioned to refer to the “n-word” as a sanitized alternative to the filthy and hurtful long-form version so we too should start referring to the “w-word” when describing that ethnic slur used to describe Mexican immigrants who came here shall we say without proper documents.Courtesy San Diego Union Tribune Ruben Navarrette Jr.Get our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and FacebookI started this crusade in April 2007 with a column for CNN.com. In it I pointed out that the w-word is used with reckless abandon by right-wing cable talk show hosts but also left-wing journalists and celebrities. I couldn’t imagine these folks using the long form of the n-word even if they were merely repeating what someone else had said. Yet they did not hesitate to use the w-word.This tells us at least two things.One for many Americans the w-word isn’t as ugly or offensive as the n-word.And two in the minds of the uninformed Mexicans and Mexican-Americans in the Southwest don’t have the same legacy of racism discrimination and mistreatment that affected African-Americans.The experiences aren’t identical of course. But given that Mexicans in states such as California Arizona and Texas endured Jim Crow-style segregation job discrimination inferior public schools lynchings and hate crimes and repression by racist law enforcement organizations there are similarities.Liberals couldn’t wait to pounce on Young’s remarks spreading the word (literally) and making sure the media knew that – gasp! – a Republican congressman had referred to Mexican immigrants using the w-word. For Democrats who are used to getting Hispanic votes without having to earn them and want to keep it that way by pointing out how bad Republicans are it was like Christmas in springtime.It didn’t help the GOP that Young was clueless about what he done wrong. After the first round of criticism the lawmaker tried to brush off the controversy by saying only that he had “used a term that was commonly used during my days growing up on a farm in Central California” and that he “meant no disrespect.”That’s funny. I grew up around farms in Central California. And I can tell you that term is all about disrespect.After fellow Republicans blasted Young for his comments and demanded that he apologize the congressman swallowed his pride. In a statement Young wrote: “I apologize for the insensitive term I used during an interview in Ketchikan Alaska. There was no malice in my heart or intent to offend; it was a poor choice of words. That word and the negative attitudes that come with it should be left in the 20th century and I’m sorry that this has shifted our focus away from comprehensive immigration reform.”If Young’s comments did shift the focus it wasn’t for long.Over the weekend business groups and organized labor signaled a major breakthrough on the road to comprehensive immigration reform when they announced they had finally struck a deal on guest worker visas a major obstacle. All that remains now is for the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” to unveil their bipartisan legislation by their April 8 deadline.I’m glad to see Republicans jumped on Young for his comments. But where is this outrage when other GOP lawmakers flirt with ethnic demagoguery?And what about Democrats? They were in such a hurry to condemn Young for using the w-word that they missed the fact that they were repeating the word over and over again which suggests either that they’re tone deaf or that they weren’t as offended as they pretended to be.What we learn is that while leadership on matters of race and ethnicity is hard to find in either party political opportunism is alive and well.Let’s face it. Americans are not good when it comes to condemning the loaded language of race and ethnicity. We’re not careful. We’re not consistent. And we’re not sincere. It’s part of an overall breakdown in civility in our society and how dismissive we have become of anyone who raises concern. We’re too mean too childish too petty and too personal.Just look at the shameful way that MSNBC commentator Toure Neblett recently lit into Dr. Ben Carson a pediatric neurosurgeon and black conservative who has been critical of President Barack Obama. Toure all but called Carson an Uncle Tom insisting that this accomplished individual who spoke his mind was Republicans’ token “black friend” because he helps white people “assuage their guilt.”It’s never a good idea for one person of color to assess the authenticity of another – especially if it’s just for ratings.Carson likewise stepped in it when he offered his opinion on gay marriage by drawing comparisons that were harsh and inappropriate.During a recent interview on Fox News Channel he said this: “Well my thoughts are that marriage is between a man and a woman. It’s a well-established fundamental pillar of society and no group be they gays be they NAMBLA be they people who believe in bestiality. It doesn’t matter what they are. They don’t get to change the definition.”Insisting that marriage be defined in a certain way is fine. Equating same-sex marriage with behavior that society has declared deviant and criminal is not.It turns out that elected officials aren’t the only ones who sometimes cross the line with their words and should apologize for it.Follow @CNNOpinion on Twitter.Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion.The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.",0
244,Every Monday since April thousands of North Carolina residents have gathered at the State Capitol to protest the grotesque damage that a new Republican majority has been doing to a tradition of caring for the least fortunate. Nearly 700 people have been arrested in the “Moral Monday” demonstrations as they are known. But the bad news keeps on coming from the Legislature and pretty soon a single day of the week may not be enough to contain the outrage.In January after the election of Pat McCrory as governor Republicans took control of both the executive and legislative branches for the first time since Reconstruction. Since then state government has become a demolition derby tearing down years of progress in public education tax policy racial equality in the courtroom and access to the ballot.The cruelest decision by lawmakers went into effect last week: ending federal unemployment benefits for 70000 residents. Another 100000 will lose their checks in a few months. Those still receiving benefits will find that they have been cut by a third to a maximum of $350 weekly from $535 and the length of time they can receive benefits has been slashed from 26 weeks to as few as 12 weeks.The state has the fifth-highest unemployment rate in the country and many Republicans insulted workers by blaming their joblessness on generous benefits. In fact though North Carolina is the only state that has lost long-term federal benefits because it did not want to pay back $2.5 billion it owed to Washington for the program.

Lee’s picture taken down in Florida"" (I'm not linking to the hate site that houses this gem) abound and whoever the current head of both the national (currently Benjamin Jealous whose dad is white) or local NAACP groups is at the time they are the target of warped Teapublican poutrages.Other newer organizations like the Southern Poverty Law Center garner their fair share of sewage from both racists and anti-semites alike since they were founded by Morris Dees (who is not Jewish but is attacked as if he is) and Joseph J. Levin Jr.I'm a card-carrying member of the NAACP and have always been fascinated by its history.The Birth of the NAACP The Race Riot of 1908 in Abraham Lincoln's hometown of Springfield Illinois had highlighted the urgent need for an effective civil rights organization in the U.S. This event is often cited as the catalyst for the formation of the NAACP. Mary White Ovington journalist William English Walling and Henry Moskowitz met in New York City in January 1909 and the NAACP was born. Solicitations for support went out to more than 60 prominent Americans and a meeting date was set for February 12 1909. This was intended to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the birth of President Abraham Lincoln who emancipated enslaved African Americans. While the meeting did not take place until three months later this date is often cited as the founding date of the organization. The NAACP was founded on February 12 1909 by a diverse group composed of W. E. B. Du Bois Ida B. Wells Archibald Grimké Henry Moskowitz Mary White Ovington Oswald Garrison Villard William English Walling (the last son of a former slave-holding family)Florence Kelley a social reformer and friend of Du Bois and Charles Edward Russell a renowned muckraker and close friend of Walling who helped plan the NAACP and served as acting chairman of the National Negro Committee (1909) a forerunner to the NAACP. On May 30 1909 the Niagara Movement conference took place at New York City's Henry Street Settlement House from which an organization of more than 40 individuals emerged calling itself the National Negro Committee. Du Bois played a key role in organizing the event and presided over the proceedings. Also in attendance was African-American journalist and anti-lynching crusader Ida B. Wells-Barnett. At its second conference on May 30 1910 members chose as the organization's name the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and elected its first officers who were: National President Moorfield Storey BostonChairman of the Executive Committee William English WallingTreasurer John E. Milholland (a Lincoln Republican and Presbyterian from New York)Disbursing Treasurer Oswald Garrison VillardExecutive Secretary Frances BlascoerDirector of Publicity and Research Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois.Much to the surprise of many not familiar with this history many of these founders were white. Though I spent years studying black history with W.E.B. Dubois and Ida Wells-Barnett as two of my favorite subjects it wasn't until later in my studies that I focused on any of the white founders. I'll feature two of them here today.NAACP founding member Mary White OvingtonMary White Ovington was born April 11 1865 in Brooklyn New York. Her parents members of the Unitarian Church were supporters of women's rights and had been involved in anti-slavery movement. Educated at Packer Collegiate Institute and Radcliffe College Ovington became involved in the campaign for civil rights in 1890 after hearing Frederick Douglass speak in a Brooklyn church. In 1895 she helped found the Greenpoint Settlement in Brooklyn. Appointed head of the project the following year Ovington remained until 1904 when she was appointed fellow of the Greenwich House Committee on Social Investigations. Over the next five years she studied employment and housing problems in black Manhattan. During her investigations she met W.E.B. Du Bois and was introduced to the founding members of the Niagara Movement. ...On September 3 1908 she read an article written by Republican William English Walling also a Liberal entitled ""Race War in the North"" in The Independent. Walling described a massive race riot directed at black residents in the hometown of Abraham Lincoln Springfield Illinois that led to seven deaths the destruction of 40 homes and 24 businesses and 107 indictments against rioters. Walling ended the article by calling for a powerful body of citizens to come to the aid of blacks. Ovington responded to the article by writing Walling and meeting at his apartment in New York City along with social worker Dr. Henry Moskowitz. The group decided to launch a campaign by issuing a call for a national conference on the civil and political rights of African-Americans on the centennial of Lincoln’s birthday February 12 1909... After the war Ovington served the NAACP as board member executive secretary and chairman. The NAACP fought a long legal battle against segregation and racial discrimination in housing education employment voting and transportation. They appealed to the Supreme Court to rule that several laws passed by southern states were unconstitutional and won three important judgments between 1915-1923 concerning voting rights and housing...Ovington retired as a board member of the NAACP in 1947 ending 38 years of service with the organization. She died on July 15 1951.William English Walling Chairman of NAACP Executive Committee (1910–1911)William English Walling (1877–1936) (known as ""English"" to friends and family) was an American labor reformer and Socialist Republican born in Louisville Kentucky. He was the grandson of William Hayden English the Democratic candidate for vice president in 1880 and was born into wealth. He was educated at the University of Chicago and at Harvard Law School. He was a co-founder of the NAACP and founded the National Women's Trade Union League in 1903. In 1906 following a trip to Russia to report on the abortive Russian Revolution of 1905 he married Anna Strunsky a Jewish immigrant and an aspiring novelist from San Francisco. In 1908 he published Russia's Message a book inspired by the social unrest he and his wife had observed in Russia. In 1908 Walling and his wife went to Springfield Illinois to investigate a race riot. As a result of their investigations Walling wrote an article The Race War in the North for the September 3 issue of The Independent in which he stated “the spirit of the abolitionists of Lincoln and Lovejoy must be revived and we must come to treat the negro on a plane of absolute political and capitalist equality.” He also appealed for a “large and powerful body of citizens to come to their aid.” The article directly led to the founding of the NAACP.So here we have two staunch anti-racists who helped found an anti-racist organization 104 years ago. Clearly not anti-white. But let's fast forward to today. Though the NAACP does not keep racial demographics for its membership and yes a majority are black Americans NAACP membership is open to all. The current head of the Aiken County South Carolina Branch of the NAACP Phillip Howell  is white. There are also local chapter heads who are Latino.I always find it odd that no one on the right has ever accused me of being ""anti-black"" because of my membership to a whole range of mainly ""white"" organizations over the years from the ACLU to the AARP. In fact no one ever calls them ""white"" groups at all they are just ""groups"" because white is the norm that needs no descriptor in our society one must add an adjective to describe anything else.I've voted for white presidents and white senators attended mostly white colleges and universities with the exception of Howard University in Washington D.C. Howard due to its history and founding purpose is ""a historically black college"" (HBCU) which of course obfuscates the fact it has over the years graduated white students especially from the medical school during a time when Ivy League med schools had a Jewish quota. Howard was founded by a white man—Oliver O. Howard for whom it is named. I remember having a conversation with Harris Wofford during the time he was the president of SUNY Old Westbury before he became a senator from Pennsylvania. He mentioned having attended Howard Law school.The history of the civil rights movement in this country is one that has been forged out of the activism of people of all backgrounds. I'm always surprised when people question me about my former membership in the Black Panther Party assuming it was anti-white simply because of it having ""black"" in the name and its militancy. Yet anyone familiar with the history of the Rainbow Coalition forged by Fred Hampton knows that to be a lie as well.So next time you encounter someone online or in real life spreading faux propaganda about the NAACP or any anti-racist group hit them with the facts.Better still if you are white why not join me in becoming a card-carrying NAACP member. Then you can show them your ""card"" for real.",0
246,CHICAGO — Mitt Romney is back — and so is his foot.As reported in The Wall Street Journal Romney is planning on re-emerging in ways that will “help shape national priorities” such as assisting the Republican Party as it tries to regain its footing with the non-white voters who ignored the GOP standard-bearer at the polls in 2012.Yes the man known for favoring the term “self-deportation” and offending scores of Hispanics by using the word “illegals” over and over again during prime-time presidential debates wants to give Republicans advice on reaching out to minorities.Romney told the Journal that in addition to wishing his campaign had poured more money into ads targeting Hispanic voters the GOP needs “to translate our message in a way that minorities understand.”Honestly of all the slips Romney committed during last year’s campaign — from letting his staffers tell Spanish-language media that he was struggling with Latinos because they were simply not well-informed to never calling out his fellow Republicans for using degrading language when speaking about immigrants or Hispanics — this latest is probably the most insulting.1 of 171 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Republicans View Photos A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Caption A collection of cartoons about the GOP. Tom Toles Wait 1 second to continue.Some Latino advocates spent the year leading up to the election painting him as a racist for not compromising on his views toward illegal immigration. But I always thought his biggest failure as a candidate was his inability to connect with people who aren’t rich and privileged. His terrible tone-deafness for non-whites was a close second.Let’s unpack his recent comment starting with the tricky loaded word “translate.” My first impression was that Romney used the word because he like so many others still believes that most Hispanics can’t speak English.Can someone please get this man on the Pew Hispanic Center’s email list? Almost two-thirds of Hispanics report speaking only English or speaking it very well according to the nonpartisan research organization.That sounds touchy you say? Well what else could he have meant? The GOP’s 2012 platform said the party wanted to “rebuild the economy and create jobs reform government to serve the people and build healthy families great schools and safe neighborhoods.” These concepts don’t need to be broken down into some simplified code so minorities can make sense of them.And this is the second hot button Romney’s statement pushes. Did he not hear about how a leading Republican think tank the Heritage Foundation ticked off Latinos when it became known that an anti-immigration reform study was co-authored by a researcher who had authored a Harvard Ph.D. dissertation contending Hispanics have particularly low IQs?A mere month after that deeply offensive controversy is not the time to imply that minorities have a hard time comprehending the basic tenets of an organization’s values and need special help to understand.Actually it’s Republicans such as Phyllis Schlafly and Pat Buchanan — who have suggested that what the GOP really needs is to double-down on white voters and lamented that “white folks are losing interest in politics and voting” — who need someone to translate for them.Ann Telnaes animation: Ann Romney reflects on her husband’s election defeat. (Ann Telnaes/The Washington Post)Schlafly Buchanan and others who find it silly that some Republicans think immigration reform will send Latino voters into the arms of the GOP aren’t wrong to be skeptical about such a proposition. It’s a long shot at best and Republicans are better off banking on the fact that Latinos care more about education the economy health care and the federal budget deficit than immigration.But Hispanics as with all minority voters do care greatly about being treated with respect which is exactly the top concern that the Republican National Committee outlined in their December 2012 treatise “The Growth and Opportunity Project.”In plain English it calls on the Republican Party to “stop talking to itself” change the “perception that the GOP does not care about people” and begin to “engage [ethnic minority voters] and show our sincerity.”As the RNC points out America now looks different and the GOP simply needs to deal with it in a civil manner. The report quotes tea party leader Dick Armey on the topic of tone: “You can’t call someone ugly and expect them to go to the prom with you.”See? That’s great advice. And here’s some for Romney: If you want to help the Republicans with their Hispanic and minority outreach just write some checks and stay out of earshot.Follow Esther Cepeda on Twitter @estherjcepeda.,0
247,“Somebody finally said this has got to stop” said John D. Negroponte a former diplomat and director of national intelligence under George W. Bush. “Maybe if there are more prosecutions it will.”But critics argue that the Cartwright case and now the appeals court ruling show how the antileak campaign has gone too far producing a chilling effect on news gathering without deterring leakers. Mr. Snowden has said he was inspired by the deeds of Pfc. Bradley Manning who is facing a court-martial after divulging the diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks.“I think it has gotten away from them” said Morton H. Halperin who served in national security or diplomatic positions in three previous administrations. “If the president doesn’t fix this I think his claim that he understands the importance of balancing the First Amendment against claims of national security will lack any credibility.”Implicitly at least Mr. Holder seemed to acknowledge some of the criticism this month when he restored and bolstered longstanding Justice Department restraints on seeking evidence from journalists. He said those restrictions “will help ensure the proper balance is struck when pursuing investigations into unauthorized disclosures.”Mr. Holder’s move came in response to a torrent of criticism after the revelations this spring that prosecutors had secretly subpoenaed the phone logs for more than 20 phone lines of The Associated Press in one leak inquiry and two days of phone logs of a Fox News reporter James Rosen in another investigation aimed at a State Department adviser Stephen Jin-Woo Kim. Prosecutors also obtained a court-ordered search warrant for Mr. Rosen’s e-mails by identifying him as a criminal co-conspirator of Mr. Kim’s.But Mr. Holder’s conciliatory message was seemingly undermined by the Justice Department’s success in overturning a lower court’s ruling that a reporter for The New York Times James Risen had a First Amendment right to refuse to reveal his sources in the trial of a former C.I.A. analyst Jeffrey Sterling. Mr. Sterling was charged in 2010 with disclosing classified information to Mr. Risen about a covert operation to deceive Iranian scientists described in Mr. Risen’s 2006 book “State of War.”,1

249,Billionaire Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg defended President Barack Obama’s troubled Obamacare website HealthCare.gov in an interview with ABC News’ This Week in which he pushed for amnesty.“You know sometimes stuff doesn’t work when you want it to. We’ve certainly had plenty of mistakes and things that haven’t worked the way that we want to” Zuckerberg said of Facebook’s website when asked by ABC News about Obamacare’s website failure. “The right thing here is just to keep on focusing on building the service that you think is right in the long term.”In the interview Zuckerberg attempted to frame granting amnesty to America’s at least 11 million illegal aliens as a “civil rights issue”–a talking point used by Attorney General Eric Holder earlier this year.“When you meet these children who are really talented and they’ve grown up in America and they really don’t know any other country besides that but they don’t have the opportunities that… we all enjoy it’s really heartbreaking–right? That seems like it’s one of the biggest civil rights issues of our time” Zuckerberg said. “There are a lot of misconceptions about that… and a lot of them came here because they just want to work. They want to help out their families and they want to contribute.”Zuckerberg alluded in the interview that his goal in pushing for amnesty is to get tech workers from abroad for his company rather than hiring Americans for jobs at Facebook.“The future of our economy is a knowledge economy” Zuckerberg said. “And that means that getting the most talented people into this country is the most important thing that we can do to make sure that the companies of tomorrow are founded here.”Zuckerberg’s interview came as he and a group of illegal aliens last week conducted a “hackathon” to push for amnesty.“One of the things that the ‘dreamers’ here today show is that even if you know you’re a child of someone who came here who wouldn’t be considered one of the higher-skilled workers… you can be one of the entrepreneurs of tomorrow” Zuckerberg said of the hackathon. “That’s the American dream.”Zuckerberg was asked too about how thus far amnesty efforts have been stalled in Congress despite all the money he has spent through FWD.us and other lobbyists have spent through their respective outfits pushing to create support in Washington for comprehensive immigration reform. He said he still thinks there is a possibility an amnesty could be passed into law.“I’m fundamentally an optimistic person as an entrepreneur” he said. “The vast majority of Americans want this to happen.”Zuckerberg has relaunched advertising efforts to push for an immigration bill out of the House this Congress.,1
250,"Revelations that the National Security Agency (NSA) has been secretly logging the phone and Internet activity of millions of Americans has caused a rift between President Obama and several of his Hollywood supporters.Actor and liberal activist John Cusack tweaked the administration tweeting “Prism the name for electronic prison – all have to wear lojacks” in reference to the PRISM data mining program revealed in leaks by former NSA employee Edward Snowden last week.Cusack also re-tweeted “Obama is becoming the next Nixon.”Prominent writer/director Judd Apatow of “Knocked Up” fame also took to Twitter to blast the administration: “What is this North Korea? We are so inundated with so much info and so many problems – we have given up caring.""Apatow also drew attention to reports on the scandal calling it ""an outrageous breach of the privacy and rights of American citizens.”Liberal filmmaker Michael Moore also hopped on the bandwagon tweeting “the administration has now lost all credibility” while spotlighting a 2007 Obama quote: “that means no more illegal wiretapping of American citizens. No more (spying) on citizens... No more tracking citizens...""Some media critics called the celebrities' about face a welcome change.“I am encouraged to see the Hollywood left is starting to dish out some bipartisan criticism. Now the NSA scandal under the Obama administration has many feeling betrayed by a Democrat who promised more transparency and less intrusion” political blogger and author Thomas Moyer told FOX411 Pop Tarts column. “Further it hits a lot closer to home when you find out that your personal phone records are being monitored something that scares a lot of people.”But some left-leaners in Hollywood had no problem with the administration's reported actions. Liberal comedian and HBO host Bill Maher praised both the tapping and Obama’s handling of the growing scandal during his program Friday night.“I’m okay with it now that Obama is in office. I’m kind of trusting of him” he said. “We live in a world of nuclear weapons. And there are religious fanatics who would love to get one and set if off here… The fact that a city can be demolished in one second kinda tips the scale for me. I’m not saying to look into your emails is the right thing I’m just saying I’m not gonna pretend it’s ‘cause I’m brave it’s ‘cause I’m scared.”And Chrissy Teigen best known for posing in swimsuits for Sports Illustrated and being engaged to singer John Legend also dismissed the issue on Monday.“On NSA: I’m most shocked you’re shocked” she wrote. “Although I understand why you’re upset I personally could not care less.”The Guardian broke the story late Wednesday that the federal government was collecting phone call records from Verizon customers.The Guardian and the Washington Post followed with a series of reports about the calls being taken from other telecommunications companies and that the NSA and FBI have a Internet scouring program code-named PRISM that records Internet activities all part of a post-9/11 effort to thwart terrorism.",1

252,It begins.There is no question that rank-and-file gay couples of all political stripes are sincere in their desire to enjoy the benefits and status that come with marriage. There is no sinister agenda at work in the issue of same-sex marriage among the masses. But the same cannot be said of the organized left who have always intended to use the issue of gay marriage as a vehicle to destroy the Christian Church and marginalize Christians.Faithfulness to the Bible and the Christian faith will very soon be declared bigotry by the media and a de facto civil rights violation by the State.What is currently happening to the Boy Scouts of America at the hands of the organized left is nothing more than a trial run for what is surely coming next against the Church. The small ball has already begun: lawsuits harassment and media campaigns against those who preach what the Bible says. The Big Leagues however don’t launch until the State lights the torchfor the witch hunt and that has already happened in the state of Washington.Although America’s most protected right is freedom of religion that didn’t stop the state attorney general from filing a suit against Baronelle Stutzman a florist who said it was a “violation of conscience” to service a same-sex wedding.JD Bristol attorney for Arlene’s said his client has many customers and employees who are gay and the claim that she is “discriminating on the basis on sexual orientation is nonsense.”“This is about gay marriage it’s not about a person being gay” Bristol said. “She has a conscientious objection to homosexual marriage not homosexuality. It violates her conscience.”According to the florist in response to standing by her Christian beliefs she has received hate mail and threats to burn down her business.This is not an isolated incident either. Back in February a baker who wouldn’t provide a cake for a lesbian wedding not only faced protesters but is (or was) under investigation by the Oregon Attorney General. Back in 2006 a Catholic adoption service in Boston had to shut down after the government demanded the religious entity service same-sex couples.For those skeptical of the organized left’s desire to destroy the Church; one question: is it really a leap to believe that the same government currently attempting to force the Church and other religious business-owners to pay for the abortion pill will soon use the same arguments and precedents to force same sex marriage on these institutions?Hat tip to Dan Riehl by way of Rush Limbaugh.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC,1
253,In a press conference Monday President Obama addressed the Internal Revenue Service’s targeting of groups critical of government and said “I’ve got no patience with it. I will not tolerate it.” (The Washington Post)In a press conference Monday President Obama addressed the Internal Revenue Service’s targeting of groups critical of government and said “I’ve got no patience with it. I will not tolerate it.” (The Washington Post)Internal Revenue Service officials in Washington and at least two other offices were involved with investigating conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status making clear that the effort reached well beyond the branch in Cincinnati that was initially blamed according to documents obtained by The Washington Post.IRS officials at the agency’s Washington headquarters sent queries to conservative groups asking about their donors and other aspects of their operations while officials in the El Monte and Laguna Niguel offices in California sent similar questionnaires to tea-party-affiliated groups the documents show.IRS employees in Cincinnati told conservatives seeking the status of “social welfare” groups that a task force in Washington was overseeing their applications according to interviews with the activists.Lois G. Lerner who oversees tax-exempt groups for the IRS told reporters Friday that the “absolutely inappropriate” actions were undertaken by “front-line people” working in Cincinnati to target groups with “tea party” “patriot” or “9/12” in their names.In one instance however Ron Bell an IRS employee informed a lawyer representing a conservative group focused on voter fraud that the application was under review in Washington. On several other occasions IRS officials in Washington and California sent conservative groups detailed questionnaires about their voter outreach and other activities according to the documents.View Graphic A report due this week says the IRS targeted groups with names containing “tea party” and “patriot.”“For the IRS to say it was some low-level group in Cincinnati is simply false” said Cleta Mitchell a partner in the law firm Foley & Lardner who sought to communicate with IRS headquarters about the delay in granting tax-exempt status to True the Vote.Moreover details of the IRS’s efforts to target conservative groups reached the highest levels of the agency in May 2012 far earlier than has been disclosed according to Republican congressional aides briefed by the IRS and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration ­(TIGTA) on the details of their reviews.Then-Commissioner Douglas Shulman a George W. Bush appointee who stepped down in November received a briefing from the TIGTA about what was happening in the Cincinnati office in May 2012 the aides said. His deputy and the agency’s current acting commissioner Steven T. Miller also learned about the matter that month the aides said.The officials did not share details with Republican lawmakers who had been demanding to know whether the IRS was targeting conservative groups Republicans said.“I wrote to the IRS three times last year after hearing concerns that conservative groups were being targeted” Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (Utah) the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee said in a statement Monday. “In response to the first letter I sent with some of my colleagues Steven Miller the current Acting IRS Commissioner responded that these groups weren’t being targeted.”“Knowing what we know now” he added “the IRS was at best being far from forth coming or at worst being deliberately dishonest with Congress.”As new details emerged Monday Democrats and Republicans alike decried the agency’s actions as an unacceptable abuse of power.In a news conference Monday President Obama said he learned of the investigating in media reports on Friday and has “no patience with it.”“If in fact IRS personnel engaged in the kind of practices that have been reported on and were intentionally targeting conservative groups then that’s outrageous” Obama said. “And there’s no place for it. And they have to be held fully accountable.”White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Monday that the White House counsel’s office learned of an upcoming IRS inspector general’s report on April 22 as part of a routine notification but had not received access to the report.On Capitol Hill two Senate panels — the Finance Committee and the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations — announced Monday that they will investigate. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and the Ways and Means Committee have been looking into reports of IRS attempts to single out organizations on the right for heightened scrutiny. Ways and Means has called IRS officials to testify Friday.“These actions by the IRS are an outrageous abuse of power and a breach of the public’s trust” said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.). “The IRS will now be the ones put under additional scrutiny.”Separately Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Rep. Mike Turner (R-Ohio) introduced companion bills Monday that would require the IRS to fire any employee found “willfully” violating “the constitutional rights of a taxpayer” according to statements by both lawmakers. The bills also would make them criminally liable for their actions.Even as Obama vowed that his administration “will make sure that we find out exactly what happened on this” however the IRS offered no new information on how it selected which groups to single out for scrutiny.The White House is legally barred from contacting the IRS about a tax matter under a prohibition adopted after the Watergate scandal. And although it can contact the Treasury Department about tax issues neither Treasury nor the IRS can disclose specific taxpayer information. The IRS can release information about a petition for tax-exempt status only after it has been approved.Obama is not in a position to remove Lerner a career official who can be terminated for cause only under normal civil service proceedings. The IRS has two political appointees: the commissioner who serves a five-year term and the chief counsel.As the IRS came under broader political attack Monday more details surfaced on how the exempt-organizations division struggled to determine which nonprofits should receive “social welfare” status after the 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ruling. That decision which allowed corporations and unions to raise and spend un­limited amounts of money on elections opened the door for groups to accept undisclosed contributions as long as their “primary purpose” was not politics.In a Jan. 9 2012 letter to the Richmond Tea Party IRS specialist Stephen Seok asked questions including “the names of the donors contributors and grantors” as well as the size of the contributions and grants and when they were given.Richmond Tea Party President Larry Nordvig whose group applied for tax-exempt status in December 2009 and received it in July 2012 said the extended inquiry had “a very chilling effect” on how much money the group could raise because its donors preferred anonymity.The Wetumpka Tea Party of Alabama experienced a two-year delay after submitting its initial application.Becky Gerritson a 44-year-old stay-at-home mother and the group’s president said the IRS sent a questionnaire asking for the names of all volunteers donor identification and contribution amounts the names of any legislators its members had communicated with directly or indirectly and the contents of all speeches its members had made among a long list of other details.“I was outraged” Gerritson said. “Being an election year I felt like it was intimidation.”The group did not provide the information. Approval came only after the group sought help from the American Center for Law and Justice which threatened a lawsuit against the IRS Gerritson said.Although some of the groups were explicitly labeled “tea party” or “patriot” others that came under intense scrutiny were focused on challenging the Affordable Care Act — known by many as Obamacare — or the integrity of federal elections.In a June 3 2011 letter to the IRS Mitchell questioned the agency’s motivations for delaying recognition of one of her clients who had filed nearly two years earlier writing “Is the [group’s] opposition to Obamacare and the takeover of America’s healthcare system by the government the reason that this application has been held up and not approved?”Catherine Engelbrecht president of the Houston-based True the Vote first filed for tax-exempt status in July 2010. At one point Engelbrecht — who is still awaiting a determination from the IRS regarding her voting rights organization and a separate tea party group King Street Patriots — said an IRS employee informed her: “I’m just doing what Washington is telling me to do. I’m just asking what they want me to ask.”The IRS did not respond to requests for comment Monday.Josh Hicks and Julie Tate contributed to this report.Discuss this topic and other political issues in the politics discussion forums.,1
254,The newest Obama scandal is seventeen months old.Welcome to Trayvongate where the President of the United States used both the bully pulpit the Department of Justice and sly media manipulation to gin up charges of racism in the George Zimmerman/Trayvon Martin shooting. Now that the trial is almost finished and the only act of racism mentioned so far came from the victim–Martin called Zimmerman ‘a creepy ass cracker’ according to testimony–the cynical and repeated use of the race card by the White house is even more abhorrent.Judicial Watch revealed documents today that proved what Breitbart News reported in April 2012: that Eric Holder’s Department of Justice took an active role in racially charged rallies in Sanford Florida and that the Community Relations Service helped force the temporary resignation of Sheriff Bill Lee. That resignation made it appear that Sanford authorities were suspect and possibly complicit in covering up something.Some of my reporting at the time was based on interviews with numerous public officials in Sanford who wanted to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution from the Obama administration. They described a situation where the CRS team took over and forced decisions while clearing a path for protests and rallies that heightened the appearence of racial tensions.The CRS is a small unit within the Department of Justice and ostensibly it serves a legitimate purpose; attempting to cool down tense situation. As its website says:The Community Relations Service is the Department’s “peacemaker” for community conflicts and tensions arising from differences of race color and national origin. Created by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 CRS is the only Federal agency dedicated to assist State and local units of government private and public organizations and community groups with preventing and resolving racial and ethnic tensions incidents and civil disorders and in restoring racial stability and harmony.However under the highly politicized Holder Department of Justice the CRS has acted as ‘spies and muscle’ according to a source familiar with the unit. In the Zimmerman case they ended up as doing nothing to facilitate ‘racial stability and harmony ‘ instead acting a heavy thumb on the scales of justice and helping to force events that gave the nation an impression that Martin’s death was racially motivated.Not just George Zimmerman but the police and the entire town were targeted in rallies that saw people being bused-in for protests. We now have proof via the Judicial Watch release that these rallies were facilitated by the Obama administration. They were also highly racially charged. Close Obama ally Al Sharpton along with Jesse Jackson led the charge. As CBS Miami reported:“We live in the middle of an American paradox” Rev. Sharpton told the crowd. “We can put a black man in the White House but we cannot walk a black child through a gated neighborhood. We are not selling out bowing out or backing down until there is justice for Trayvon.” “This is not about a hoodie it’s about racial profiling” Jackson said. “We will use our marching feet civil disobedience and every weapon in our non-violent arsenal until justice is served.”However much of the rhetoric surrounding the Zimmerman story was violent. Many will remember that the New Black Panther party actually offered a $10000 bounty for the ‘capture’ of George Zimmerman. As the Orlando Sentinal reported:New Black Panther leader Mikhail Muhammad announced the reward during a protest in Sanford Saturday. And when asked whether he was inciting violence Muhammad replied defiantly: “An eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth.” The bounty announcement came moments after members of the group called for the mobilization of 10000 black men to capture Zimmerman who shot Trayvon in a gated Sanford community on Feb. 26. Muhammad said members of his group would search for Zimmerman themselves in Maitland — where the 28-year old worked before the shooting employees there told the Orlando Sentinel. He declined to say when the group would begin their search.J. Christian Adams knows the New Black Panther Party well; he resigned his position at the DOJ over the refusal to prosecute the Panthers for the now infamous Philadephia voter intimidation actions during the 2008 election. Adams outlined the crimes committed by the NBPP in Sanford:Let’s start with solicitation to kidnap. In announcing a reward for the seizure of Zimmerman the New Black Panthers may have violated Florida Code 787.01. It makes it a felony to “by threat confining or abducting or imprisoning another person against his . . . will without lawful authority with intent to . . . terrorize.” Merely soliciting someone else to do this is also a felony in Florida under Florida Code 777.04. “A person who solicits another to commit an offense prohibited by law and in the course of such solicitation commands encourages hires or requests another person to engage in specific conduct which would constitute such offense or an attempt to commit such offense commits the offense of criminal solicitation.”That’s only part of the list. The New Black Panther’s outrageous illegal call for vigilante justice happened on March 24th. According the records obtained by Judicial Watch the Department of Justice deployed to Sanford the next day: March 25th 2012. However the DOJ did not go to Sanford to make arrests against the New Black Panthers. Instead according the the written record obtained by Judicial Watch they “deployed to Sanford FL to work marches demonstrations and rallies related to the shooting and death of an African-American teen by a neighborhood watch captain.”Once again the Holder Department of Justice failed to prosecute the New Black Panther Party. They actually helped facilitate mass rallies against Zimmerman and the City of Sanford.These actions are made even more scandalous by the direct insertion of the President of the United States into the story. President Obama made his famous “If I had a son he’d look like Trayvon” remark at the White House but what got considerably less press was the fact that Obama had a prior relationship with Martin’s attorney Benjamin Crump. Obama worked with him on another racially charged case when he was a Senator.Breitbart News reported on the Obama connection to the 2006 story of Martin Lee Anderson. Attorney Crump said publicly that he was following the same media ‘playbook’ as the Anderson case. Tactics included using a photo of Anderson as a child the same way the media used the Crump-supplied photo of Trayvon Martin as child. This story from 2006 shows the involvement of Senator Obama (who did not end up appearing at the rally) Sharpton and Jackson as well as other usual suspects from the far left.A rally will be taking place in Tallahassee Friday April 21 regarding the ongoing investigation into the death of 14-year-old Martin Lee Anderson. Anderson died Jan. 6 at a Panhandle boot camp after being kneed and punched by Bay County Sheriff’s boot camp guards. Students from Florida State University Tallahassee Community College and Florida A&M University have been involved in the planning and organization of the event at which Rev. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton will be making appearances. Charlie and Martin Sheen who donated $10000 to the cause are also reportedly planning to attend Friday along with former TLC member Tionne “T-Boz” Watkins and Afeni Shakur mother of the murdered rapper Tupac Shakur. According Samantha Greer an FSU student and volunteer for the Coalition for Justice for Martin Lee Anderson Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois may also make an appearance. Greer stressed that the Coalition is still looking for volunteers and that anyone is welcome to join the cause.What we saw in 2012 was the Obama administration using taxpayer resources to ratchet up racial tensions in a local crime case and literally creating key story points in the narrative such as forcing the sheriff to temporarily resign. At the same time the President himself made an emotional statement about the victim with direct reference to his race without revealing that he had worked with the victim’s attorney a few years earlier in a similar case. At the same time Obama media ally (and Sharpton employer) NBC outrageously edited the Zimmerman audio to make Zimmerman appear racist. All these manipulative and deceptive uses of the race card–pushed along by the Holder DOJ at taxpayer expense–happened just months before the 2012 presidential election.The only reason this isn’t a major scandal already is the media hasn’t ever done its job and declared it one.,1
255,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Internal Revenue Service has refused to provide documents over the past two years to a congressional panel exploring whether the agency gave tougher scrutiny to tea party and other conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status a leading Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee said Friday.Rep. Charles Boustany Jr. R-La. spoke minutes before the committee was holding Congress' first hearing on the IRS's targeting of conservatives.""We've asked for documents for two years now and all we've gotten is stonewalling from the IRS"" Boustany who heads the Ways and Means oversight subcommittee said on C-SPAN television.""We need specific information about who made these decisions why were these decisions made why wasn't there proper oversight what was the chain of command and who knew what"" Boustany said previewing questions lawmakers planned to pursue.With the scandal joining a parade of political troubles buffeting President Barack Obama the committee planned to question the agency's ousted chief Steven Miller on Friday.Miller acting director until he resigned Wednesday seems sure to get a hostile reception. Members of both parties have spent the past week bitterly chastising the agency for abandoning its charge of making nonpolitical decisions about which groups should qualify for tax-exempt status which makes it easier for them to collect contributions from donors.Lawmakers have said that even though they asked the IRS repeatedly about complaints from conservative groups that their applications were being treated unfairly the agency — including Miller — never told them the groups were being targeted. They said this continued even after May 2012 when the agency says Miller was briefed on the practice. Miller was previously a deputy commissioner whose portfolio included the unit that made decisions about tax-exempt status.Also to testify Friday was J. Russell George the Treasury Department's inspector general for tax administration.Story continuesA report George issued this week concluded that the IRS office in Cincinnati which screened applications for the tax exemptions improperly singled out tea party and other conservative groups for tougher treatment. The report says the practice began in March 2010 and lasted more than 18 months.Republicans have spent the past few days trying to link the IRS' improper scrutiny of conservatives to Obama. The president has said he didn't know about the targeting until last Friday when Lois Lerner who heads the IRS division that oversees tax-exempt groups acknowledged at a legal conference that conservative groups had been singled out. She said it was wrong and apologized.""I promise you this that the minute I found out about it then my main focus was making sure that we get the thing fixed"" Obama said Thursday.Even so less than four months into his second term the president has been on the defensive for the IRS controversy along with questions about last September's attack in Benghazi Libya that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans and the government's seizure of The Associated Press' telephone records as part of a leaks investigation.In one of the latest GOP attacks Sen. Rob Portman R-Ohio wrote Obama on Thursday asking whether the White House or Treasury Department pressured the IRS on the treatment of conservative groups. In the letter Portman accused the administration of ""policies that threaten to chill disfavored political speech.""The inspector general's report said all IRS officials questioned said their actions ""were not influenced by any individual or organization outside the IRS.""The report blamed ""ineffective management"" for letting IRS officials craft ""inappropriate criteria"" to review applications from tea party and other conservative groups based on their names or political views. It found that the IRS took no action on many of the conservative groups' applications for tax-exempt status for long periods of time hindering their fundraising for the 2010 and 2012 elections.Many of the groups were applying for tax-exempt status as social welfare organizations which are allowed to participate in campaign activity if that is not their primary activity. The IRS judges whether that imprecise standard is met.Friday's hearing was just the start of Congress' probe of the IRS' actions with the Senate Finance and House Oversight committees planning hearings next week.In addition Attorney General Eric Holder has said the FBI was investigating whether the IRS may have violated applicants' civil rights.Obama has rejected the idea of naming a special prosecutor to investigate the episode saying Thursday that the probes by Congress and the Justice Department would get to the bottom of who was responsible.Obama has named Daniel Werfel a top White House budget officer to replace Miller.Also Thursday Joseph Grant one of Miller's top deputies announced plans to retire June 3 according to an internal IRS memo. Grant is commissioner of the agency's tax exempt and government entities division which includes the agents that targeted tea party groups for additional scrutiny.Grant joined the IRS in 2005 and took over as acting commissioner of the tax exempt and government entities division in December 2010. He was just named the permanent commissioner May 8.When asked whether Grant was pressured to leave IRS spokeswoman Michelle Eldridge said Grant had more than 31 years of federal service and it was his personal decision to leave.Before he joined the IRS Grant was a top official at the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.Grant's predecessor at the IRS was Sarah Hall Ingram who is now director of the agency's Affordable Care Act Office. Ingram was in charge of the tax exempt division when IRS agents first started targeting conservative groups.The IRS said Ingram was assigned to help the agency implement the health care law in December 2010 about six months before the Treasury inspector general's report said her subordinate the director of exempt organizations learned about the targeting.",1
256,As the nation’s top law enforcement official Eric Holder is privy to all kinds of sensitive information. But he seems to be proud of how little he knows.Why didn’t his Justice Department inform the Associated Press as the law requires before pawing through reporters’ phone records?“I do not know” the attorney general told the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday afternoon “why that was or was not done. I simply don’t have a factual basis to answer that question.”Why didn’t the DOJ seek the AP’s cooperation as the law also requires before issuing subpoenas?“I don’t know what happened there” Holder replied. “I was recused from the case.”1 of 68 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Obama View Photos A collection of cartoons of the president. Caption A collection of cartoons of the president. Wait 1 second to continue.Why asked the committee’s chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) was the whole matter handled in a manner that appears “contrary to the law and standard procedure”?“I don’t have a factual basis to answer the questions that you have asked because I was recused” the attorney general said.On and on Holder went: “I don’t know. I don’t know. . . . I would not want to reveal what I know. . . . I don’t know why that didn’t happen. . . . I know nothing so I’m not in a position really to answer.”Holder seemed to regard this ignorance as a shield protecting him and the Justice Department from all criticism of the Obama administration’s assault on press freedoms. But his claim that his “recusal” from the case exempted him from all discussion of the matter didn’t fly with Republicans or Democrats on the committee who justifiably saw his recusal as more of an abdication.“There doesn’t seem to be any acceptance of responsibility in the Justice Department for things that have gone wrong” said Rep. James Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) after Holder placed the AP matter in the lap of his deputy. “We don’t know where the buck stops.”The best Holder could do was offer an “after-action analysis” of the matter and pledge the administration’s renewed support for a media shield law (the same proposed law the Obama administration undermined three years ago). But that does nothing to reverse the damage the administration has already done with its wholesale snooping into reporters’ phone records and its unprecedented number of leak prosecutions.“I realize there are exceptions and that you have recused yourself but it seems to me clear that the actions of the department have in fact impaired the First Amendment” Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) told Holder. “Reporters who might have previously believed that a confidential source would speak to them would no longer have that level of confidence because those confidential sources are now going to be chilled in their relationship with the press.”Ann Telnaes animation: Eric Holder gets stuck. (Ann Telnaes/The Washington Post)In a sense the two topics that dogged Holder most on Wednesday — the AP phone records and the IRS’s targeting of conservative groups — were one and the same. In both cases Americans are being punished and intimidated for exercising their right of free expression — by the taxing authorities in the conservatives’ case and by federal prosecutors in the reporters’ case.But Holder cared so little about those two issues that he said not a peep about either the IRS or the AP in his opening statement. When he was questioned about the AP case his first response was to suggest the criticism of him was political. “I mean there’s been a lot of criticism” Holder said. “In fact the head of the RNC called for my resignation in spite of the fact that I was not the person involved in that decision.”Republicans on the House committee had voted previously to hold Holder in contempt of Congress and Holder made clear the feeling was mutual; he informed Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) that his line of questioning was “too consistent with the way in which you conduct yourself as a member of Congress. It’s unacceptable and it’s shameful.” Some of the Republicans provided Holder justification for his disdain. Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.) defying the chairman’s gavel shouted a stream of exotic accusations at Holder closing with the complaint that Holder was casting “aspersions on my asparagus.”But there would be more sympathy and support for Holder if he took seriously the lawmakers’ legitimate questions about his department’s abuse of power in the AP case. He may have recused himself from the leak probe that led to the searches of reporters’ phone records (a decision he took so lightly that he didn’t put it in writing) but he isn’t recused from defending the First Amendment.Didn’t the deputy attorney general who approved the subpoenas have the same potential conflict of interest that Holder claimed?“I don’t know.”When did Holder recuse himself?“I’m not sure.”How much time was spent exploring alternatives to the subpoenas?“I don’t know because as I said I recused myself.”But when the Justice Department undermines the Constitution recusal is no excuse.Twitter: @MilbankRead more from Dana Milbank’s archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.,1
257,If we give the president the benefit of the doubt and assume he knows the truth is going to come out the question remains: Does the administration appoint the special prosecutor sooner or later? The calculus inside the White House is how to best protect the president’s political interests. They have two options. They could delay the appointment and let more of the story develop weather the ugly piecemeal disclosures give the players time to get their stories straight and lawyer-up and hope Republicans continue their overreach giving the whole affair a nutty partisan patina. Or they could accelerate the appointment of a special prosecutor thereby slowing the congressional inquiries and giving Jay Carney some relief from his daily embarrassing routine by supplying him with the escape hatch of not being allowed to comment on matters associated with the special prosecutor’s ongoing investigation. Not to mention the White House all the while could blast the appointed counsel as a partisan ideologue à la the hatchet job that was done on Ken Starr.Anyway if the president is innocent he will end up needing and wanting a special prosecutor sooner rather than later. If he and his White House already have too much to hide then they must clam up cry partisanship and hope their allies on the Hill and in the media have the stamina for the long hard slog ahead.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement– – – – –My personal favorite of all the new revelations from the Obama IRS scandal is that White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler told White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough about the impending IRS inspector general report but of course the White House chief of staff did not tell the president.I sat in a White House chief of staff’s office every day for more than two years. The only reason the legal counsel would tell the chief of staff about an impending report or disclosure would be so the chief of staff could tell the president. The legal counsel would assume the chief of staff would know how and when to bring up the matter. The chief of staff would be expected to know if there were additional factors surrounding the issue that needed to be considered before the president was told or whether or not others needed to be included in the conversation when the information was shared with the president. There are many valid reasons why the chief of staff would tell the president but I can’t think of a reason why he and the legal counsel would both agree that this news nugget would go no further. It’s very odd.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe legal counsel would never assume that information shared with the chief of staff would not go to the president. In my experience a legal counsel never would believe that there was information that was appropriate for the chief of staff to know but that was inappropriate for the president to know. Out of all the news that has emerged regarding the Obama IRS scandal this is the most curious whopper I’ve heard so far. I can’t wait to hear the real story.,1
258,"Kevin Johnson USA TODAYCareer attorneys lashed out in e-mails%2C Internet postingsReview describes a dysfunctional culture in Justice Department%27s Civil Rights DivisionInvestigators find insufficient evidence that key decisions were based on race or politicsWASHINGTON — An internal Justice Department review of its voting rights section found career attorneys engaged in political and ideological warfare featuring racially charged Internet postings e-mails and personal attacks.The 258-page review by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz spanning the George W. Bush and Obama administrations described a highly dysfunctional culture within the agency's Civil Rights Division that ""contributed to the appearance of politicization"" involving the division's enforcement decisions.However investigators determined that there was ""insufficient evidence to conclude"" that key decisions involving voting cases were based on race or partisan considerations.More than two years in the making the report comes as Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez chief of the agency's Civil Rights Division is a likely nominee for Labor secretary.Perez's conduct was not seriously faulted. His confirmation in 2009 came after key decisions were made about the handling of a voter intimidation case against members of the New Black Panther Party (NBPP) in Philadelphia.That case focused on the actions of two black men one of whom carried a nightstick outside a polling place on Election Day 2008. The bulk of the case which included the New Black Panther Party chairman and the party organization was dismissed during the Obama administration prompting Republican lawmakers to call for the review.""Critics of the decisions made in the NBPP case have alleged that the decision to dismiss … reflected hostility in the current administration to enforcing the voting rights laws on behalf of white victims or against black defendants"" Horowitz said in the report. ""We did not find sufficient evidence to conclude that (Justice officials) who approved the decision were so motivated.""The report did document a ""disappointing lack of professionalism by some department employees over an extended period of time."" Investigators found a series of Internet postings by employees using pseudonyms that ""contained heated political and even racist commentary.""""One used the expression 'po' Niggrahs' in describing a manager's attitude toward blacks"" according to the report which did not identify the employee. In another posting an unidentified employee described the likely neighborhood of a conservative career attorney colleague as a place where ""everyone wears a white sheet the darkies say 'yes'm' and equal rights for all are the real land of make believe.""In a written response Perez said steps have been taken to improve the ""atmosphere and professional culture within the voting rights section during the past several years.""""The voting section is a far different place in 2013 than it was in 2005 or 2007"" Perez said. ""Nonetheless we acknowledge … that voting rights enforcement is a particularly important area in which to assure professionalism and integrity.""Rep. Frank Wolf R-Va. one of the lawmakers who called for the review said he was ""deeply troubled"" by the report's findings.""The report makes clear that the division has become a rat's nest of unacceptable and unprofessional actions"" Wolf said.",1
259,"The Justice Department's investigation and surveillance of the Associated Press and Fox News have led to perhaps the most sustained wave of criticism for the Obama administration's media policies since the president took office.On Wednesday the New York Times became one of the more influential voices to say what many others have been saying: that the administration's methods are an attack on press freedom.In a scathing editorial the Times wrote that ""With the decision to label a Fox News television reporter a possible 'co-conspirator' in a criminal investigation of a news leak the Obama administration has moved beyond protecting government secrets to threatening fundamental freedoms of the press to gather news.""The Times editorial described the Obama administration as going ""overboard"" with its investigations into leaks and threatening press freedom. The board added:Obama administration officials often talk about the balance between protecting secrets and protecting the constitutional rights of a free press. Accusing a reporter of being a 'co-conspirator' on top of other zealous and secretive investigations shows a heavy tilt toward secrecy and insufficient concern about a free press.The Times editorial was just one in a chorus of hard-hitting attacks on Obama's media policy that have surfaced in the wake of the Justice Department investigations. Journalists were outraged by the inquiries into the AP and Fox News reporter James Rosen. In particular members of the media took issue with the Justice Department labeling Rosen a possible ""co-conspirator"" in a leak case for the crime of trying to get a source to give up information.The New Yorker reported on Tuesday that the investigation into Rosen was even broader than previously suspected as the DOJ seized records from at least five different numbers used by Fox News and two different White House lines.That followed the Associated Press' revelation that the DOJ had secretly obtained months of phone records for at least seven individual journalists across 20 phone lines while searching for the government official responsible for leaking information about a CIA-thwarted terror plot.Obama's hyper-aggressive leak policy—and his administration's potential equation of routine journalistic interaction with criminality—is nothing new. But the fury in the pages and on the websites of elite outlets about these positions certainly is.The Times' criticism echoed that of many other journalists and press freedom groups.On Tuesday the board of the Committee to Protect Journalists sent an outraged letter to Attorney General Eric Holder in which it warned that the DOJ's secret subpoenas for over 20 AP phone lines ""represent a damaging setback for press freedom in the United States."" This came on the heels of a letter signed by over 50 media outlets which made similar arguments.Wednesday also saw Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank lash out at Obama:The Rosen affair is as flagrant an assault on civil liberties as anything done by George W. Bush’s administration and it uses technology to silence critics in a way Richard Nixon could only have dreamed of. To treat a reporter as a criminal for doing his job — seeking out information the government doesn’t want made public — deprives Americans of the First Amendment freedom on which all other constitutional rights are based. Guns? Privacy? Due process? Equal protection? If you can’t speak out you can’t defend those rights either.",1
260,An April 2013 email from a career Department of Homeland Security official released on Friday by the office of Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) stated that the Department of Homeland Security “absolutely gave special treatment” to green card visa applications filed by foreign national EB-5 investors in GreenTech Automotive the company Virginia Democratic gubernatorial nominee Terry McAuliffe served as chairman of from 2010 to 2012.In the released email the names of the sender as well as the recipient have been redacted but both are described as “career DHS officials.” The text of the email also refers to a person called “D1” which Senator Grassley’s office believes is US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) director Alejandro Mayorkas. President Obama nominated Mayorkas to become Deputy Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security on June 27.Mr. Mayorkas testified before a Senate committee holding hearings on his nomination on July 25. The hearings were attended by only Democrats. Republicans did not participate because Mr. Mayorkas is the subject of an investigation by the Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General’s Office.The email dated April 12 2013 is from a “Senior USCIS Career Official” and is sent to “USCIS Career Officials.” It reads as follows:We absolutely gave special treatment to GreenTech at the directive of D1. D1 was working directly with the RC’s [EB-5 Regional Center] atty [name redacted]. Additionally I would call a wholesale rewrite of the AAO’s [Administrative Appeals Office] decision by the front office special treatment. Look at the first draft in the attached email and the final version attached.Senator Grassley asked Mr. Mayorkas about an apparent inconsistency between this email and his earlier testimony in a letter he sent to Mr. Mayorkas on Thursday. Grassley wrote to Mayorkas that “you testified [on July 25]: ‘I have never ever in my career exercised undue influence to influence the outcome of a case.'” Grassley noted in his letter to Mayorkas that “D1 [mentioned in the April 12 2013 email] is an apparent reference to you.”Grassley then cited Mayorkas’ testimony to the Senate committee on July 25:Several documents call into question some of the statements you made regarding preferential treatment in your testimony at last Thursday’s hearing. For example you were asked in the hearing about communications with Terry McAuliffe with respect to Gulf Coast Funds Management. You testified: “I was asked to attend a meeting with Mr. McAuliffe so that I could hear in person his complaints… two years ago… I heard those complaints and that was the extent of the interaction… I moved on with my work.” (Emphasis included in Grassley letter)But Grassley wrote “Contrary to the impression left by your answer documents indicate that both before and after that meeting you actually engaged in nearly a dozen contacts with Gulf Coast Funds Management between 2010 and 2013 including direct communications with Gulf Coast’s attorneys.” Grassley concluded “That one meeting with Mr. McAuliffe was clearly not the extent of your interaction on that matter.”The EB-5 foreign national investor program has come under intense scrutiny over the past several years. Under the program enacted into law in 1990 foreign nationals may obtain temporary and permanent green card resident visas in return for investing a minimum of $500000 in an American company.The possibility that foreign nationals who have invested in GreenTech Automotive have been granted temporary green card visas due to the political influence of the principals involved is a key issue currently under investigation by the Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General’s Office.Terry McAuliffe who was chairman of GreenTech Automotive during the period when political influence may have played a role in the granting of visas is a friend and chief fundraiser for former President Bill Clinton. Anthony Rodham brother of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is the President and CEO of Gulf Coast Funds Management which the Department of Homeland Security designated the EB-5 Regional Center that works exclusively with GreenTech Automotive to help secure green card visas for its EB-5 investors.Grassley’s letter to Mayorkas was one of two stories about GreenTech Automotive that made headlines on Friday. In a related story GreenTech Automotive confirmed to Breitbart News on Friday that it has received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission to produce company documents. According to the Washington Post those documents were subpoenaed as evidence in the SEC’s investigation into claims made by GreenTech Automotive to its investors.,1

262,"Aamer MadhaniUSA TODAYObama acknowledges he may not be best person to lead a dialogue on racePresident was criticized for remarks in a prior race-related caseSuggests Americans give deeper thought to racial biasWASHINGTON — When it comes to dealing with the sticky issue of race in America President Obama has found that leading from behind might not be such a bad idea.He was pilloried by critics on the right early in his presidency when he said a Cambridge Mass. police officer ""acted stupidly"" when he arrested the black Harvard University scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. as he struggled to open the door of his home in a predominantly white neighborhood.And Obama raised eyebrows when he remarked after Trayvon Martin's death last year that ""if I had a son he'd look like Trayvon.""So it's no surprise that he took a cautious approach as he weighed in for the first time since a Florida jury found George Zimmerman not guilty in the death of Trayvon.In a surprise appearance before reporters six days after the verdict Obama spoke eloquently about Trayvon's family showing grace in the aftermath of the verdict and he reiterated his understanding of the pain the African-American community feels over the outcome of the trial and the larger problem of racial profiling.And Obama again connected himself directly to the teenager when he observed that he could have been Trayvon 35 years ago.But the president despite the historic nature of his presidency also made clear that he's not the best person to be leading a difficult conversation about race.Instead he argued that the larger discussion of race belongs not with lawmakers in Washington but in living rooms houses of worship and workplaces.In such settings Obama posited ""There's the possibility that people are a little bit more honest and at least you ask yourself your own questions about am I wringing as much bias out of myself as I can?""The president rightfully noted that as a nation we've made progress in our dialogue on race. But as he also made clear we're hardly in a post-racial era.Obama who has long contended with a portion of America's views about his ""other-ness"" seems to have realized that a president – even an African-American one – can sometimes serve the public dialogue on race best by merely participating in the conversation rather than directing it.",1
263,According to a breaking report from the UK Guardian Barack Obama’s National Security Agency has been collecting phone records of millions of domestic customers of Verizon under a court order obtained in April. The order requires Verizon to turn over phone records on an “ongoing daily basis” to the NSA both within the US and between the US and international sources.The Guardian reports: “The document shows for the first time that under the Obama administration the communication records of millions of US citizens are being collected indiscriminately and in bulk – regardless of whether they are suspected of any wrongdoing.” The secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA) handed over the order to the FBI on April 25 and gave them a three month blanket surveillance clearance. That means that numbers of both parties location data call duration and time of all calls are subject to government surveillance. That makes the Obama administration’s oversight essentially unlimited.The NSA White House and Department of Justice all declined comment. The court order says that Verizon is forbidden to let customers know about the surveillance. Verizon also declined comment.The order forces Verizon to turn over electronic versions of “all call detail records or ‘telephony metadata’ created by Verizon for communications between the United States and abroad” … or more ominously “wholly within the United States including local telephone calls.” Every single day Verizon must turn over that information.The Guardian says that Verizon may not be the only cell-phone provider targeted with the order and adds that “previous reporting has suggested the NSA has collected cell records from all major mobile networks.”The law legalizing this sort of surveillance is 50 USC 1861 a provision of the Patriot Act allowing requests of business records.This sort of controversy arose in 2006 under President Bush under the auspices of the war on terror. President Obama essentially declared the war on terror over in April at about the same point the administration received its blanket surveillance go-ahead from the FISA court.Ben Shapiro is Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News and author of the New York Times bestseller “Bullies: How the Left’s Culture of Fear and Intimidation Silences America” (Threshold Editions January 8 2013).,1
264,Appearing before Planned Parenthood’s annual convention last Friday President Obama pledged his continuing support for women’s reproductive rights. In a speech before the National Academy of Sciences on Monday Mr. Obama promised to keep science a sphere “not subject to politics” or “skewed by an agenda.”On Wednesday his administration betrayed both reproductive rights and science. The Justice Department announced that it would appeal a federal court ruling that would make morning-after pills available without a prescription for girls and women of all ages.In 2011 the secretary of health and human services Kathleen Sebelius overruled the Food and Drug Administration which had decided based on scientific evidence that the pills would be safe and appropriate “for all females of child-bearing potential.” Ms. Sebelius arbitrarily determined that only women 17 and older should have access to the drug.Then last month citing the political nature of Ms. Sebelius’s intervention and finding no “coherent justification” for it Judge Edward Korman of United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York ordered the F.D.A. to make emergency contraceptives available over the counter to all women with no age restrictions.,1
265,"Glenn Harlan ReynoldsEmails demonstrate that the targeting of Tea Party groups was orchestrated from the top.The IRS shared information with the FEC%2C raising questions about how politicized both agencies were.A poll shows that fewer Americans than ever trust the federal government.With all the excitement over Syria last week -- we went from ""Assad is Hitler"" to ""we have achieved peace in our time"" almost overnight! -- you may have missed another big story. The IRS scandal which has slumbered over the summer as Congress has been in recess seems to be waking up.It has now been over four months since the IRS admitted it was targeting conservative groups in the run-up to the 2012 election. The chief IRS official in charge of Exempt Organizations Lois Lerner has ""taken the Fifth"" -- invoking her right against self-incrimination in order to avoid testifying before Congress on what went on. Nonetheless President Obama -- who himself ""joked"" about auditing his enemies -- has lumped the IRS misconduct in with what he calls ""phony scandals.""But new emails have come out that make the IRS scandal look anything but phony. Emails recovered by the House Ways and Means Committee demonstrate that the targeting of Tea Party groups -- and of voter-integrity groups -- was orchestrated from the top of the agency. Rather than being conducted by a few rogue employees in the Cincinnati office of the IRS the Tea Party targeting was regarded by Lerner as something ""very dangerous"" politically and she observed that ""Cincy should probably NOT have these cases.""The emails also reveal Lerner's concerns that the Democrats might lose their Senate majority and her hopes that the Federal Election Commission might ""save the day"" by interfering with right-leaning grassroots activity. The IRS also shared information with the FEC something not permitted by statute raising questions about just how politicized both agencies were.An editorial in Investor's Business Dailyobserves:""Like the Internet video the Benghazi terrorist attack was blamed on the only thing phony about the IRS scandal is the administration's cover story that a couple of rogue agents in the Cincinnati office concocted and executed this most blatant abuse of power by the most powerful and feared agency of government. Lerner's email further blows out of the water that discredited fiction. It also confirms a suspected reason for the planned intimidation and hamstringing of conservative opposition to the Obama administration's policies saying that those Tea Party group applications for tax-exempt status could end up being the 'vehicle to go to court' to get more clarity on the 2010 Supreme Court ruling on campaign finance rules.""That's right and that's just another reason why we need to get to the bottom of the IRS scandal which isn't the least bit ""phony."" It seems to me that there are two possible problems here. One is that this came from the Obama White House. The other is that the -- overwhelmingly Democratic -- career civil service at the IRS didn't need White House instructions to go after Tea Party groups it saw as enemies.The first possibility is bad enough but is presumably remediable with stricter rules. The second possibility however calls into question the possibility of a nonpartisan career civil service and certainly the possibility of fair administration for something as complex and involving as many discretionary decisions as the Internal Revenue Code. Worse yet given that overwhelming partisan identification with Democrats pervades the civil service as a whole it calls into question the very possibility of a nonpartisan and politically neutral civil service.I'm not ready to call for a return to the ""spoils system"" but the fully politicized federal bureaucracy of our nation's first century or so did have two advantages: First presidents couldn't hide behind the bureaucracy as they were presumed responsible for the actions of government bureaus staffed with their supporters; and second politicians were less inclined to trust the bureaucracy with enormous and discretionary power when they knew that it would sometimes be staffed by their political adversaries.At any rate it all boils down to trust. One reason for the resonance of not only the IRS scandals but also the NSA scandal the Benghazi scandal Fast and Furious and so on is that fewer Americans than ever trust the federal government. It's a mess that needs to be cleaned up and denying that the mess exists only exacerbates the lack of trust.It's doubtful that Eric Holder's Justice Department -- which is even more partisan and politicized than the IRS -- will clean this mess up. Nor is Holder likely to appoint a special prosecutor. So it's up to congressional investigators to get to the bottom of it.

266,"Sen. Rand Paul is blasting Attorney General Eric Holder's assertion that the government could conceivably use drones against its own citizens in the U.S. as ""frightening"" saying such an action would violate the Constitution.Paul R-Ky. was responding to comments by Holder released Tuesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee approved the nomination of John Brennan President Obama's pick to be his next CIA director.Paul said in a statement obtained by Fox News that Holder sent him two letters regarding the constitutionality of the use of legal force such as drones against Americans and on U.S. soil after Paul petitioned Brennan to speak on the matter.In the letter Holder says the U.S. has never carried out a drone strike against one of its citizens on American soil and calls a situation where such a strike may occur ""entirely hypothetical"" and ""unlikely to occur.""However Holder does not entirely rule out that such a scenario may occur in the future and indicates that such a strike would be legal under the Constitution.More On This...“It is possible I suppose to imagine an extraordinary circumstance in which it would be necessary and appropriate under the Constitution and applicable laws of the United States for the president to authorize the military to use lethal force within the territory of the United States"" Holder said.Holder said ""catastrophic"" attacks such as the Sept. 11 attacks or the attack on Pearl Harbor are examples of circumstances where the president could conceivably feel such an action is necessary.Paul says he is not satisfied with the attorney general's response.“The U.S. Attorney General’s refusal to rule out the possibility of drone strikes on American citizens and on American soil is more than frightening it is an affront on the constitutional due process rights of all Americans” Paul said.Paul says he also received a statement from Brennan who stated that the CIA does not have authority to order such operations be carried out.Brennan vigorously defended the use of drone strikes during his confirmation hearing. He declined to say whether he believes waterboarding which simulates drowning amounted to torture. But he called the practice ""reprehensible"" and said it should never be done again. Obama ordered waterboarding banned shortly after taking office.Drone strikes are employed only as a ""last resort"" Brennan told the committee. But he also said he had no qualms about going after U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki in September 2011.A drone strike in Yemen killed al-Awlaki and Samir Khan both U.S. citizens. A drone strike two weeks later killed al-Awlaki's 16-year-old son a Denver native.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",1
267,How often do the mainstream media misinform or outright lie? How many of them apologize or correct the record for the misinformation and lies? How often do they research and correct the political points they were forced to air from politicians and political operatives?Currently the mainstream media are scolding the Obama administration for lack of access and for using other types of media (social media and local media) to get their information out directly. They insinuate the behavior is tantamount to state run media.Maybe if the mainstream media behaved as Jon Stewart in the video below the administration would be less reticent. It is refreshing to watch Stewart who realizes that inasmuch as he is a satirist he should apologize and correct the record when he wrongly maligns someone.Last week he did a skit on Mississippi taking 148 years to ratify the 13th amendment the amendment that abolished slavery. He implied that the former Mississippi secretary of state Dick Molpus who presided over a 1995 attempt to ratify the 13th amendment may have been a casual bigot. It turned outDick Molpus had a long and distinguished record for speaking out for Civil Rights.He led charge on voting rights reform.In 1989 he spoke at the 25th year anniversary of the three kids killed in Mississippi during the Civil Right conflicts for which he received death threats.What is telling is no one called the Jon Stewart show to ask him to correct the record. He did it out of duty. One can only hope that in the long run the mainstream media will be forced to act accordingly. They have yet to apologize for all the misinformation that they have put out from the buildup to the war in Iraq to the misinformation about the Affordable Care Act. They could learn a bit from Stewart.VIDEO HERELIKE My Facebook Page – Visit My Blog: EgbertoWillies.comFollow @EgbertoWillies,0
268,John EastmanHuman Rights Campaign published a confidential tax return of the National Organization for Marriage.There is no question that someone at the IRS leaked the document that was published by the HRC.It is imperative that Congressional investigators get to the bottom of the issue.The world is learning about the corruption of the IRS in targeting conservative groups including various Tea Party organizations for heightened scrutiny. But the corruption goes much deeper than harassing groups seeking first time non-profit designations into actively sabotaging existing non-profit groups by releasing confidential information.In March of 2012 the Human Rights Campaign published a confidential tax return of the National Organization for Marriage which was immediately republished byThe Huffington Post and other liberal news media outlets. The HRC and NOM are the leading national groups on opposing sides of the fight over gay marriage. HRC wants to redefine marriage to make it genderless while NOM wishes to preserve marriage as the union of one man and one woman.NOM a targetMy organization was not the only conservative-linked political group or business that appears to have faced shady actions from IRS employees. ProPublica reported this week that the IRS handed over to them confidential documents of nine conservative organizations whose applications for non-profit status were still pending. Among them: Crossroads GPS a key group backing Mitt Romney's presidential campaign.Our case was particularly egregious because the IRS leak of confidential information fed directly into an ongoing political battle. For months before March 2012 the pro-gay marriage HRC had been demanding that my group NOM publicly identify its major donors something that NOM and many other non-profits refuse to do. The reason is simple. In the past gay marriage advocates have used such information to launch campaigns of intimidation against traditional marriage supporters.Just as gay marriage proponents were demanding the information the IRS appears to have illegally given them exactly what they were looking for. The tax return released by the HRC contained the names and addresses of dozens of major donors to NOM. And there's little doubt where the documents came from. The tax returns contained internal coding added by the IRS after the returns were originally submitted.For the IRS to leak any organization's tax return to its political opponents is an outrageous breach of ethics and if proven constitutes a felony. Every organization — liberal and conservative — should shudder at the idea of the IRS playing politics with its confidential tax return information. But the situation here is even more egregious because the head of the HRC was at the time serving as a national co-chair of President Obama's re-election campaign.The release of NOM's confidential tax return to the Human Rights Campaign is the canary in the coal mine of IRS corruption. Contrary to assertions that the targeting of Tea Party groups was an error in judgment by low-level IRS bureaucrats the release of NOM's confidential data to a group headed by an Obama campaign co-chair suggests the possibility of complicity at the highest levels of politics and government. This wasn't a low-level error in judgment; it was a conscious act to reward a prominent Obama supporter while punishing an opponent.That's the reason the IRS has not been very interested in getting to the bottom of what happened. Federal investigators have interviewed NOM officials about the matter but our efforts to find out what has become of the investigation have been stonewalled at every turn.Not about marriageThe tendency of some is to set this serious issue aside because it is seemingly part of the war on traditional marriage an issue that divides the country in half and bedevils many. But given the broader issues being raised about the IRS that's not right.At this stage nobody is accusing the White House or the Obama re-election campaign of illegal activity. But there is a serious question about whether there was communication or possible collusion between the IRS and the HRC and if there was whether anyone at the White House or the Obama re-election campaign was involved.It is imperative that congressional investigators get to the bottom of the issue. If the IRS can get away with leaking NOM's confidential tax return to its chief political opponent then no taxpayer is safe from political retribution by the federal government.John Eastman a constitutional law professor at Chapman University is chairman of theNational Organization for Marriage.In addition to its own editorials USA TODAY publishes diverse opinions from outside writers including our Board of Contributors.,1

270,The Pentagon has released a statement confirming that soldiers could be prosecuted for promoting their faith: “Religious proselytization is not permitted within the Department of Defense…Court martials and non-judicial punishments are decided on a case-by-case basis…”.The statement released to Fox News follows a Breitbart News report on Obama administration Pentagon appointees meeting with anti-Christian extremist Mikey Weinstein to develop court-martial procedures to punish Christians in the military who express or share their faith.(From our earlier report: Weinstein is the head of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation and says Christians–including chaplains–sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ in the military are guilty of “treason” and of committing an act of “spiritual rape” as serious a crime as “sexual assault.” He also asserted that Christians sharing their faith in the military are “enemies of the Constitution.”)Being convicted in a court martial means that a soldier has committed a crime under federal military law. Punishment for a court martial can include imprisonment and being dishonorably discharged from the military.So President Barack Obama’s civilian appointees who lead the Pentagon are confirming that the military will make it a crime–possibly resulting in imprisonment–for those in uniform to share their faith. This would include chaplains–military officers who are ordained clergymen of their faith (mostly Christian pastors or priests or Jewish rabbis)–whose duty since the founding of the U.S. military under George Washington is to teach their faith and minister to the spiritual needs of troops who come to them for counsel instruction or comfort.This regulation would severely limit expressions of faith in the military even on a one-to-one basis between close friends. It could also effectively abolish the position of chaplain in the military as it would not allow chaplains (or any service members for that matter) to say anything about their faith that others say led them to think they were being encouraged to make faith part of their life. It’s difficult to imagine how a member of the clergy could give spiritual counseling without saying anything that might be perceived in that fashion.In response to the Pentagon’s plans retired Lt. Gen. Jerry Boykin who is now executive vice president of the Family Research Council (FRC) said on Fox & Friends Wednesday morning:It’s a matter of what do they mean by “proselytizing.” …I think they’ve got their defintions a little confused. If you’re talking about coercion that’s one thing but if you’re talking about the free exercise of our faith as individual soldiers sailors airmen and marines especially for the chaplains they I think the worst thing we can do is stop the ability for a soldier to be able to exercise his faith.”FRC has launched a petition here which has already collected over 60000 signatures calling on Secretary Hagel is stop working with Weinstein and his anti-Christian organization to develop military policy regarding religious faith.**UPDATE**The FRC petition has now exceeded more than 40000 signatures at the time of this update.Breitbart News legal columnist Ken Klukowski is senior fellow for religious liberty with the Family Research Council and on faculty at Liberty University School of Law.,1
271,"Obama showed her displeasure – pausing to confront Sturtz eye to eye according to witnesses.“One of the things that I don’t do well is this” she said to applause from most of the guests according to a White House transcript. “Do you understand?”A pool report from a reporter in the room said Obama “left the lectern and moved over to the protester.” The pool report quoted Obama as saying: “Listen to me or you can take the mic but I'm leaving. You all decide. You have one choice.""Obama’s suggestion that she would leave was not included in the official White House transcript.The audience responded by asking Obama to remain according to the pool report which quoted a woman nearby telling Sturtz “You need to go.”Sturtz was escorted out of the room. She said in an interview later she was stunned by Obama’s response.“She came right down in my face” Sturtz said. “I was taken aback.”Sturtz said she told Obama she was happy to take the microphone to plead her case which Sturtz said appeared to fluster the first lady.“I said I want your husband to sign the executive order” Sturtz said. “Her husband could sign this order tonight and protect 22 percent of the work force in this country.”Sturtz said she paid $500 to attend the fundraiser part of a protest cooked up by the gay rights group GetEqual which gained notice in Obama’s first term for hectoring him during speeches and demanding more action on lesbian gay bisexual and transgender issues. Sturtz who gave $5000 to the Democratic Party and Obama's campaign in 2008 according to the Center for Responsive Politics said she was devoting herself to full-time activism now pressing the White House on the employment discrimination issue.The proposed executive order that prompted Sturtz’s outburst would prohibit federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.LGBT activists many of whom hailed Obama for his vocal support for same-sex marriage rights in the months leading up to his reelection in 2012 have been increasingly dismayed that the White House has not yet acted on the proposed order.The issue has been building for years pushed by gay rights advocates who argue that more than 20 percent of the U.S. workforce is employed by federal contractors. Advocates for the executive order have attempted to exert more quiet pressure highlighting cases of discrimination by some firms and connecting workers to administration officials to make personal appeals.White House officials have said they back legislation to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity but have declined to say whether the executive order is pending.Metro Weekly a gay newspaper reported in 2012 that as a presidential candidate in 2008 then-Sen. Obama had pledged to a Houston LGBT group that he would support a “formal written policy” of non-discrimination.Read more: How do you handle a heckler?

272,"Raul ReyesThe president has the authority to offer temporary relief from immigration removals.He could end the controversial Secure Communities program.He could also broaden the number of immigrants eligible for deferred action.President Obama is closing in on a record. Sometime around the end of this year he will have deported 2 million undocumented immigrants more than any other president.Enough already. The Obama administration should put the brakes on its deportation train. The president has the authority to offer temporary relief from immigration removals. With reform stalled the president ought to stop trying to appease Republicans by being strong on immigration enforcement. He should consider executive action.Obama has options to allow undocumented immigrants to live without the threat of deportation. Remember this impacts only immigrants already here. He could end the controversial Secure Communities program which turns local law enforcement officers into immigration agents. He could let more immigrants qualify for temporary protected status which provides them with work and residence permits. In 2010 a leaked memo from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services revealed that the agency was exploring ""meaningful immigration reform absent legislative action."" Though an agency spokesman later characterized the memo as an ""internal draft"" the legality of such measures was not in question.Defer actionThe president's most practical route to fewer deportations would be to broaden the number of immigrants eligible for deferred action. In 2012 his administration announced the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program aimed at helping those brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Not only has the program allowed 455000 young immigrants the freedom to live and work openly it has withstood legal challenges as well. The Washington Post has noted that this program could be expanded to include other discrete classes of people such as the parents of citizen children victims of domestic abuse or whistle-blowers.Show some courageAlthough Obama said last month on Telemundo that expanding the program would be ""very difficult to defend legally"" that is not true; it would just be very difficult to defend politically. Immigration reform activists have engaged in civil disobedience nationwide. Isn't it time the president display similar courage?""I believe this president will be tempted ... to issue an executive order"" Sen. Marco Rubio R-Fla. said in August ""like he did for the DREAM Act kids a year ago where he basically legalizes 11 million people by the sign of a pen."" The website PolitiFact judged this statement ""mostly false."" On his own the president cannot offer citizenship a path to citizenship or permanent relief from deportation. He can take limited action to make our system more humane.True any executive action on immigration will anger conservative lawmakers. Rep. Bob Goodlatte R-Va. told USA TODAY that this ""would effectively kill immigration reform."" Yet Goodlatte and other House Republicans are already effectively killing immigration reform with their inaction. A unilateral move by the president might goad GOP lawmakers into actual legislating.If Obama believes immigration reform still has a chance he should not be deporting those who might be eligible for a path to citizenship. If he has given up on reform he has every reason to move ahead with executive action. Either way the right choice is to cut back on deportations.Raul Reyes is an attorney in New York and a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.In addition to its own editorials USA TODAY publishes diverse opinions from outside writers including our Board of Contributors.

274,Former Secret Service agent Dan Bongino told Breitbart News that President Barack Obama was lying when he blamed the cancellation of White House tours on his former agency.“The president’s absolutely not telling the truth when he said the Secret Service made that decision to cut [the White House] tours” Bongino said. “That’s the core of it: he is not telling the truth.”In an interview with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos Obama said the decision made as a part of sequestration was not one “that went up to the White House.”“But what the Secret Service explained to us was that they’re going to have to furlough some folks” Obama said in the interview. What furloughs mean is–is that people lose a day of work and a day of pay. And you know the question for them is you know how deeply do they have to furlough their staff and is it worth it to make sure that we’ve got White House tours that means that you got a whole bunch of families who are depending on a paycheck who suddenly are seeing a 5% or 10%–reduction in their pay. Well what I’m asking them is are there ways for example for us to accommodate school groups–you know who may have traveled here with some bake sales. Can we make sure that- kids potentially can–can still come to tour?”Bongino who served 12 years in the Secret Service including five years working directly at the White House before leaving to run as a Republican for U.S. Senate in Maryland said Obama is lying because the Secret Service does not make such decisions.“The Secret Service does not make political decisions” Bongino said. “The Secret Service makes security decisions. His statement that it was a Secret Service decision internal budget decision–and keep in mind I’m not speaking for the Secret Service I’m speaking from experience of being with them. All he’d have to do is cancel one or two of his political trips and his Martha’s Vineyard vacation which two years ago I was on and helped coordinate he would save that money times ten. There was just no way this was a sound decision. To insinuate this is the first administration where the White House social office and the Executive Office of the President had no role in cancelling public tours at the White House that he was the first president who was left out of the decision is absolute nonsense.”Bongino said he thinks the president is using “the Washington Monument strategy”–a ploy by a politician who tries to garner public opposition to spending cuts by eliminating popular public services first–in doing this to White House tours. “He wanted to inflict there is no question in my mind maximum pain upon the American people. But here’s the caveat: it had to be public pain. If you don’t see it it doesn’t hurt.”But Bongino said all the public pressure Obama has taken for the decision to cancel the tours caused the ploy to “backfire.” Regardless the ex Secret Service agent who served three years at the George W. Bush White House and two years at Obama’s White House said Obama still will not admit he was wrong and is now trying to blame the Secret Service for his own behavior.“Instead of coming clean and being honest with the American people that your office and likely you as well had a role in this he’s again pulling the wool over your eyes just like he’s done on Benghazi the immigration release [of thousands of illegal immigrants] where he said he didn’t know and Janet Napolitano said she didn’t know this is nonsense” Bongino said. “These are not security or budget decisions. These are strictly political decisions. Make no mistake about it.”Bongino said the Secret Service is not correcting Obama because the agency has “a great elite group of guys and they’re always going to take it on the chin.”“I don’t speak for them but they’re obviously a patriotic group of men and women and they’re not lying when they say there will be overtime costs saved so it’s not like they’re being disingenuous” Bongino said. “They’re trying to cover for this guy I think because they know it looks bad and they don’t want to get involved in the politics and I don’t blame them.”,1
275,"NEW YORK (AP) — Anthony Weiner's ill-fated mayoral campaign ended with a string of final embarrassments: He mustered a mere 5 percent at the ballot box. One of his sexting partners tried to crash his primary night rally. And Weiner was caught making an obscene gesture to reporters as he was driven away.Outside a ""victory"" party where supporters mourned a disappointing fifth-place finish in the Democratic primary cameras crowded around Sydney Leathers the 23-year-old whose sexting with the former congressman brought his once-high-flying campaign to a screeching halt.""Why not be here?"" Leathers asked reporters. ""I'm kind of the reason he's losing. So might as well show up.""Another politician with a sex scandal Eliot Spitzer lost the Democratic primary contest for city comptroller to Scott Stringer the Manhattan borough president. Stringer took 52 percent of the vote to Spitzer's 48 percent.Spitzer resigned as governor in 2008 and admitted he paid for sex with call girls. In exile he bounced around television as a pundit. Then just four days before the deadline he announced he was running for comptroller.On the final campaign day for both men the spotlight fell heavily on Weiner. His staff sneaked him into his own event presumably to avoid Leathers who had camped outside his headquarters all day hoping to confront him. His wife Huma Abedin who stood by his side at the height of the scandal was nowhere to be seen.And after a concession speech in which he got choked up as he spoke of family a scowling Weiner was caught by a photographer giving a middle-finger goodbye to reporters as he was driven away.Leathers who has launched a porn career since the scandal broke said Weiner needed ""to stop being an embarrassment to the city of New York. He's going to continue this behavior. If it's not going to be me it's going to be some other girl.""At one point one of Weiner's supporters scolded Leathers saying: ""You must really be ashamed!""Story continuesFor his part Weiner acknowledged in his concession speech that he was an ""imperfect messenger"" but also boasted of the staying power of himself and his campaign.Weiner had been in political exile since he resigned from Congress in 2011 for sending women lewd online messages and pictures. He got into the mayor's race in May and aside from a few dust-ups with hecklers was largely well-received at first holding the lead for most of June and July.But after an obscure gossip website named The Dirty released X-rated exchanges between Weiner and Leathers that took place well after the candidate quit the House of Representatives Weiner — and his sexting pseudonym Carlos Danger — once again became a national punchline.With 98 percent of precincts reporting Wednesday morning Weiner was far behind in the city's Democratic mayoral primary. Public Advocate Bill de Blasio had 40 percent of the vote the threshold needed to avoid triggering an automatic Oct. 1 runoff. If he cannot maintain that he will face former city Comptroller Bill Thompson who has 26 percent for a potentially grueling three-week showdown with the winner advancing to face Republican nominee Joe Lhota in the general election.Spitzer took a steadier path to his loss. He took an early lead in the polls but the race tightened dramatically in recent weeks as the Democratic establishment rallied around Stringer his main opponent.Unlike Weiner who made a point of fielding voters' questions about his scandal Spitzer apologized a few times and then refused to talk about it.He largely eschewed retail campaigning — situations that could have led to awkward exchanges with voters — in favor of national TV interviews and a big television ad campaign financed with his own millions.But he could not avoid all mention of the scandal. The city's tabloids hounded him about the state of his marriage; Spitzer said he was still married but his wife never appeared on the campaign trail.""All of us should serve participate"" Spitzer told supporters in his concession speech.

No Drama Obama is immersed in drama so over the top it could have been scripted by Shonda Rhimes and Karl Rove.Just four months after his second inauguration the president is buffeted by gushing investigations smug and deranged Republicans and cat-who-ate-the-canary conspiracists. The man who promised in 2008 to make government cool again is instead batting away charges that he has made government “Nixonian” again.Asked about that on Thursday Obama might have tried a little J.F.K. wit to dismiss the ridiculous assertion. Instead he played the pill as he too often does huffily telling reporters “Well I’ll let you guys engage in those comparisons and you can go ahead and read the history I think and draw your own conclusions.”,1
277,Back to previous pageFBI investigating allegations Sen. Menendez patronized prostitutes in Dominican RepublicA team of FBI agents has been conducting interviews in recent weeks in the Dominican Republic and the United States looking into allegations that Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) patronized prostitutes in the Caribbean nation but has found no evidence to support the claim according to two people familiar with the investigation.One person said agents have asked about whether a Florida eye doctor — a close friend and major campaign donor to Menendez — provided the senator with prostitutes on vacations there. Another person said investigators are looking into allegations involving underage prostitutes and sex parties.The two who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an active investigation said FBI agents are following leads provided by an unknown tipster. In a series of e-mails with the FBI the tipster alleged that the doctor Salomon Melgen had made prostitutes available to Menendez while he was staying at his friend’s resort home in the Dominican Republic. The tipster in particular mentioned young prostitutes and prostitution parties.The FBI agents are also examining the role Menendez played in advocating for a port security contract in the Dominican Republic that would benefit Melgen two people familiar with the case said. Menendez has urged U.S. officials to put pressure on the Dominican government to enforce the dormant contract saying enhanced port security is important for interdicting drug trafficking. Melgen is an investor in the company holding the contract.FBI spokesman Michael Leverock of the bureau’s field office in Miami declined to comment for this article.Menendez has vehemently denied the prostitution allegations calling them false “smears.”“As we have said all along Senator Menendez welcomes any review because his actions have been appropriate and we believe the facts will confirm that” a Menendez aide said Friday.The staff member who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the senator’s efforts on behalf of the port deal were appropriate. “The senator has had a long history of advocating for increased port security across the world” the aide said.Melgen and his attorneys declined to comment on any criminal investigation.The relationship between Menendez and Melgen has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks. Menendez acknowledged this month that he had failed to properly disclose two trips he took in 2010 on Melgen’s private plane to Melgen’s villa near the resort of Casa de Campo. The senator said he wrote Melgen a personal check for $58500 to reimburse him for the plane rides last month. The Senate Ethics Committee is investigating the matter.Separately Melgen is under criminal investigation over allegations of Medicare fraud. Three people with knowledge of the probe disclosed this week that it focuses on whether Melgen defrauded the government by overcharging Medicare for millions of dollars in eye injections and billing the government for treatments that were unnecessary.The FBI and the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General raided Melgen’s Palm Beach eye clinic Jan. 29 searching records and collecting boxes of documents. The raid came days after the tipster’s e-mail exchange with the FBI was posted anonymously on a Web site.Melgen’s attorney said this client was cooperating with authorities in the Medicare investigation and declined to answer further questions.“At this time it would be inappropriate to comment about the ongoing investigation” said the attorney Kirk Ogrosky.In checking into the prostitution allegations FBI agents are examining claims initially made in a series of letters the tipster wrote last spring to staff members at a government watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) according to the two people familiar with their inquiries.The claims were also carried on a conservative news Web site the Daily Caller.CREW’s executive director Melanie Sloan said her staff could not get the tipster to agree to meet or speak on the telephone. As a result Sloan told a Washington Post reporter last month she had doubts about the credibility of the person’s claims. The FBI began looking into the tipster’s story after CREW forwarded his information to the Justice Department and the FBI’s Washington field office in July.Prostitution is not illegal in the Dominican Republic. But soliciting underage prostitutes is illegal. Also a politician who accepts free gifts and special favors in exchange for official acts can face criminal prosecution for abuse of public office.The allegations in the letters included the names of a few women who allegedly had improper relations with Menendez and Melgen including that of a Dominican teenager who told a local television station she had no involvement and had never left her village.The Miami Herald reached another one of the women for an interview and she explained that she worked for Melgen and considered him a generous person but did not elaborate. An attorney for the woman Svitlana Buchyk told a Post reporter Friday that the tipster’s claims about her are “absurd.”“Ms. Buchyk is an actress and model attending to her career” said her attorney Gerald Greenberg. “Any allegation that she had an improper relationship with Senator Menendez or anyone else is sheer nonsense. The claims about her that have appeared in fringe-media sources are irresponsible and utterly absurd.”Greenberg declined to discuss whether his client had been interviewed by law enforcement officials.In an e-mail to the tipster in September FBI agent Regino Chavez wrote “If you can give me . . . information on all the young ladies who were victimized that would be helpful.” The agent repeatedly asked the tipster who called himself Pete Williams and only corresponded by e-mail to meet but he declined.According to FBI affidavits filed in court Chavez was listed last year as a member of a task force based out of the Miami field office that specialized in tracking crimes involving abuse of minors soliciting minors to engage in prostitution and sex trafficking.Ernesto Londoño and Alice Crites contributed to this report.,1
278,Just as they did with the sequester Democrats will try to blame Republicans for a potential government shutdown or cuts to the budget that may occur as part of a new debt deal this fall.Politico reported that “President Barack Obama and his Democratic allies are eager to tag the GOP as the root cause of Washington dysfunction.” Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Executive Director Kelly Ward told the publication that Democrats are planning to highlight “the inability of Republicans to actually govern” and make that into a central “narrative” going into the 2014 midterm elections.Even though the sequester idea originated in the White House as Bob Woodward documented Obama and Democrats tried to blame Republicans for the calamity that it would cause. Those tactics largely backfired as a majority of Americans favored the across-the-board budget cuts.Yet House Republicans and their advisers still remain fearful of Democrats and their tactics that have just recently failed believing that a government shutdown over de-funding Obamacare or budget cuts would lose Republicans the House.Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK) a former National Republican Congressional Committee chairman said “If you ask me what is the one thing that could reshuffle the deck on an otherwise stable mid-term environment in 2014 the answer is a government shutdown.” Brock McCleary a GOP pollster and former NRCC deputy executive director agreed saying the “only way Republicans will lose the House is to shut down the government or default on the debt.”The current continuing resolution to fund the government expires on Sept. 30 and the nation is set to hit its borrowing limit shortly after. Republicans have a 17-seat majority in the House and only four Republicans represent Districts that lean Democratic which means Republicans will be more vulnerable from the right. Republican voters in most Republican House Districts want them to be more fiscally conservative and de-fund Obamacare.Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-SC) said his voters would “rather see Republicans veer more to the right” on fiscal matters and Chris Chocola the president of the Club for Growth said “the greatest risk for Republicans is for them to continue to disappoint their supporters. I don’t think they’ve inspired them or given them a reason to support them in quite a while.”“At some point they have to communicate to people there is a difference between Republicans and Democrats” he told the publication.,1
279,"next Image 1 of 2prev Image 2 of 2A former Chicago-area executive is blowing the whistle in the latest case to showcase what is derisively known as the ""Illinois way"" -- politicians' practice of doing business by dishing out favors to friends who contribute generously to their campaigns.This time a top-ranking Democrat has been implicated. The case involves Illinois' most powerful Democratic leader -- state House Speaker Michael Madigan -- and the former head of the Chicago area's commuter rail service Metra. In a rare move earlier this week Metra's ex-CEO Alex Clifford came forward publicly to reveal specific details about how he says he was forced out of his lucrative job after refusing to cave to political pressure.Clifford who was hired from California in 2001 testified during a recent Regional Transportation Authority board meeting in Chicago. For two hours he spoke openly about what he calls serious ""ethical and moral character flaws"" from people who practice the ""Illinois way"" of doing business including Madigan.Clifford claims Madigan specifically wanted a pay raise for a Metra employee Patrick Ward who has been a generous contributor to Madigan's campaign according to state records. Clifford testified: ""What is it that he (Ward) was doing so great and so different than other employees at Metra who have gone three years without a pay raise that would make this person special?""Clifford ultimately rejected the request. In a statement Madigan acknowledged sending a ""recommendation to Metra senior staff that Mr. Ward be considered for a salary adjustment. ... When notified Mr. Clifford had concerns about the appearance of the recommendation coming from my office I withdrew the request.""During a trip to the state Capitol in Springfield Clifford says he was asked by Democratic state lawmaker Rep. Luis Arroyo to consider hiring somebody the Latino caucus sends him. Clifford says he told Arroyo ""we have a process. Times are different today at Metra than they were under my predecessor. Every applicant every employee will come in through the front door.""Clifford went on to point fingers at those who intentionally ""railroaded"" him into a poor performance evaluation which led to the end of his contract -- specifically Metra Chairman Brad O'Hallaron and another Metra board member. When Clifford approached O'Hallaron about his upcoming contract he claims O'Hallaron responded ""but we're just dating."" Then said ""I need to get a meeting with Mr. Madigan and I need to find out what kind of damage you've caused to our potential for future funding.""When it was his turn to testify O'Hallaron denied Clifford's accusations. O'Hallaron told the RTA board: ""If as alleged by Clifford I was seeking to protect Speaker Madigan why would I take his allegations immediately over to the OEIG (Office of Executive Inspector General) if I thought there was pressure from Speaker Madigan? It just doesn't make sense.""Clifford did not get the necessary votes to renew his contract earlier this year but he left Metra with a $700000 severance deal that some have characterized as ""hush money"" to keep Clifford quiet after threatening a lawsuit. Clifford denies that claim and says the money was ""100 percent about my ability to get a job and how I've been damaged.""Metra announced on Friday that it plans to hire a well-known former federal prosecutor in Chicago to perform an independent investigation into Clifford's allegations and make recommendations concerning Metra's hiring and contract policies. Metra's board of directors must approve the hiring at a special meeting on Monday.The man who oversees Illinois' government watchdog group says even though there was no illegal activity involved with the Metra scandal the case has lawmakers squirming a bit more than usual.""This is a very big deal this is the first time in anyone's memory that Speaker Madigan has been implicated so directly in the workings of a public agency"" Better Government Association President Andy Shaw said. ""Madigan and hundreds if not thousands (of politicians) do this every day. We just don't hear about it very often because it happens behind closed doors.""Shaw admits any hope for changing this type of behavior has to come from voters. ""This is only going to change in one of two ways. People coming out to vote and deciding who represents them. And secondly when a groundswell of public outrage forces public officials to impose higher ethics standards upon themselves.""Illinois' history with questionable political ethics is rich. The state practically became the poster child for corruption during the criminal trial of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich. Blagojevich attempted to sell off Barack Obama's coveted U.S. Senate seat in return for hefty campaign donations referencing it in the now infamous phone call saying ""I've got this thing and it's f------ golden and I'm not giving it up for f------ nothing.""Blagojevich is currently serving out his 14-year sentence in federal prison in Colorado.",1
280,Obama’s Debt Default Is on His Shoulders While We Shoulder His Impeachable OffensesApparently the president thinks he can furlough reality when talking about the debt limit. To suggest that raising the debt limit doesn’t incur more debt is laughably absurd. The very reason why you raise the debt limit is so that you can incur more debt. Otherwise what’s the point?It’s also shameful to see him scaremongering the markets with his talk of default. There is no way we can default if we follow the Constitution. The Fourteenth Amendment Section 4 requires that we service our debt first. We currently collect more than enough tax revenue to service our debt if we do that first. However we don’t have enough money to continue to finance our ever-growing federal government (with our $17 trillion dollar national debt that has increased over 50% since Obama took office). That’s why President Obama wants to increase the debt limit. He doesn’t want to make the tough decisions to rein in government spending. So he’s scaremongering the markets about default just as he tries to scaremonger our senior citizens about their Social Security which by the way is funded by the Social Security Trust Fund and is solvent through 2038.It’s time for the president to be honest with the American people for a change. Defaulting on our national debt is an impeachable offense and any attempt by President Obama to unilaterally raise the debt limit without Congress is also an impeachable offense. A default would also be a shameful lack of leadership just as mindlessly increasing our debt without trying to rein in spending is a betrayal of our children and grandchildren who will be stuck with the bill.This article was cross-posted at Sarah Palin’s Facebook page.,1
281,"Uh no. Neither budget thanks.Uh no. Neither budget thanks.So if you are the party committees in charge of electing Democrats in 2014 and your base is up in arms over President Barack Obama's unforced error on his budget's Social Security cuts what do you do?If you're smart like the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee you say nothing (at least so far). Why rub salt in the wounds of your strongest supporters? But if you're the guys at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee you ask them to cheer louder. In an email blast:What does backfire look like? Instead of compromising to get solutions on the budget NRCC Chairman Greg Walden outrageously attacked parts of President Obama’s budget proposal that were included at the demand of Republicans.""Ah yes DCCC your supporters are outraged that Republicans won't applaud the cutting of Social Security benefits—cuts by the way that weren't even included in Paul Ryan's draconian cut-everything-else budget. I'm sure that brought in the dough from outraged Democratic donors desperate for ""compromise"" with recalcitrant Republicans!But the DCCC isn't the only one stepping off the cliff with the president. The Democratic Governor's Association decided to play lemming as well.President Obama just released a budget for next year that will reduce the deficit while investing in the things we need to keep our economy competitive for the long-term – like pre-K for four-year olds. On the other side Paul Ryan and House Republicans have a budget that spends your hard-earned money on tax breaks for the wealthiest ends Medicare and Social Security as we know them and slashes other critical programs. Stand with us in supporting President Obama’s budget and say no to Paul Ryan’s disaster of a plan.There's no doubt that Ryan's budget is a piece of shit but if you're going to be outraged at cuts in Ryan's budget (which again doesn't include the president's chained CPI proposal) then why would you want to stand with Obama's budget?You wouldn't. A Social Security cut is a Social Security cut no matter who proposes it. Heck it's worse when proposed by Democrats. Republicans are assholes. We expect them to slash the safety net. But Democrats? If we stand for anything at all we stand for taking care of each other.Sign this petition telling the DCCC and the DGA that that that's what we should be standing for. Not Obama's cut-Social Security budget.",1
282,President Obama who faithfully shops at independent bookstores when given the chance has angered the American Booksellers Assn. with a planned appearance Tuesday at an Amazon warehouse.The appearance is “greatly misguided” ABA Chief Executive Oren Teicher wrote in an open letter to the president. That’s because the online retailer has caused a net loss of jobs the organization argues while President Obama’s goal is to promote his plan for a stronger economy.Obama’s tour is called “A Better Bargain for the Middle Class.”Amazon has just announced that it will add 7000 jobs -- 2000 of those seasonal -- at its regional shipping and customer service centers. The company says its workers make 30% more than traditional retail staffers.AdvertisementAmazon news releases often make comparative references without sharing specific data. But it’s possible to get a sense of what it will pay its Chattanooga Tenn. warehouse workers: about $11 per hour according to the jobs website glassdoor.com.That’s a bit more than the $8.25 an hour McDonald’s pays its workers -- a wage that even McDonald’s acknowledges needs to be supplemented with a second job to make ends meet and those “ends” include rent of just $600 and no budget for heat -- but it’s hard to see how an annual salary of less than $23000 a year is a better bargain for the middle class.While it’s hard to get people to agree on exactly what a middle-class wage is in 2011 CNN Money reported that the first decade of the 21st century was the first time in American history that middle-class wages declined: Adjusted for inflation median household income dropped from $53164 to $49445.A 2012 Pew Research study showed that on average Americans think it takes $70000 for a family of four to be middle class.AdvertisementPublishers Weekly the publishing industry trade magazine quotes Obama deputy press secretary Amy Brundage on the appearance: “The Amazon facility in Chattanooga is a perfect example of the company that is investing in American workers and creating good high-wage jobs” she said Friday. “What the president wants to do is to highlight Amazon and the Chattanooga facility as an example of a company that is spurring job growth and keeping our country competitive.”ABA’s Teicher protests that writing “At a time when Main Street retailers including indie bookstores show promise of recovering from the recession we are disheartened to see Amazon touted as a ‘jobs creator’ and its warehouse facility used as a backdrop for an important jobs speech when frankly the exact opposite is true.”Citing the Institute for Local Self-Reliance Teicher writes “Every $10 million in spending that shifts from Main Street retailers to Amazon results in a net loss of 33 retail jobs. That would mean for 2012 alone — using Amazon’s own numbers about its increase in sales — Amazon cost the U.S. economy more than 42000 jobs just last year!”Can President Obama be a friend to independent booksellers and Amazon at the same time? He’s been photographed at independent bookstores Prairie Lights in Iowa City and Bunch of Grapes in Martha’s Vineyard. The next time he shows up to shop for books they may have some less-than-enthusiastic words for him.AdvertisementALSO:Remembering Mick FarrenNeil Gaiman wants you to help him create a video gameReza Aslan’s Jesus book a No. 1 bestseller thanks to Fox NewsAdvertisementCarolyn Kellogg: Join me on Twitter Facebook and Google+,1
283,Story highlights President Obama to continue to push plan for economy ahead of congressional recess Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell takes fire from left and right in re-election campaign House Republicans to push for more oversight at IRS take another shot at Obamacare(CNN) —From rising rhetoric between the president and top Republicans over the economy to a marquee Senate campaign showdown politics are heating up in the summer sun and could boil over in the week ahead.1. Economic tug of warWith budget showdowns looming President Barack Obama continues to try to take his case directly to the American people.The president travels to an Amazon distribution center in Chattanooga Tennessee on Tuesday and will again speak on the economy which remains the top issue on the minds of Americans. The White House touts the address as the first in a series of policy speeches on Obama’s “better bargain for the middle class.”John King: Obama thinks he’s getting the upper hand“Tuesday’s speech will focus on manufacturing and high-wage jobs for durable economic growth and the president will discuss proposals he has laid out to jump-start private-sector job growth and make America more competitive and will also talk about new ideas to create American jobs” White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters.The Chattanooga address follows similar speeches last week where the president’s tone was sharper and more partisan than many had expected.Obama: I won’t ‘twiddle my thumbs’ waiting for GOP“If the Republicans don’t agree with me I want them to lay out their ideas. If they have got a better plan to create jobs rebuild our infrastructure to make sure that they have great ports all along the Gulf come on let me know what your ideas are” the president said Thursday in Jacksonville Florida.Congressional Republican leaders are pushing right back at the president – with deadlines to continue funding the federal government and raising the nation’s debt ceiling as well the date for implementing a crucial part of Obamacare on the horizon.Obama touts economic agenda; GOP says he’s ‘all sizzle no steak’“Look this president is a terrific campaigner. We all recognize that. He has got a way with words too. But at some point campaign season has to end and the `working with others’ season has to begin” Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor Thursday morning.“His speech turned out to be all sizzle and no steak that’s assuming there’s any sizzle left after you’ve reheated this thing so many times” House Speaker John Boehner chimed in later.With one week left before the congressional summer recess both Democrats and Republicans will ramp up the rhetoric over the strong possibility of a government shutdown in the autumn. Both sides are pointing fingers in a heated blame game and the fight will continue into the August recess as the action moves to lawmakers’ home states and districts.2. Marquee Senate showdown beginsWhat could ultimately be the most expensive and bitter Senate battle in the 2014 midterm elections formally begins Tuesday when Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes kicks off her Democratic challenge to McConnell who’s running for a sixth term in the Senate.In a preview of how nasty things could get Grimes blames McConnell for greatly contributing to the gridlock in Washington saying in a video previewing her rollout that the Senate Republican leader is “the biggest part of the problem. He’s wasted decades blocking legislation that would have helped Kentucky and our country. And over the last few years he’s done it for the worst possible reason – out of spite.”Web wars start in crucial 2014 Senate raceEven before announcing her candidacy this month Grimes had already come under attack both by an Internet ad put out by the McConnell campaign that poked fun at the amount of time she was taking to make a decision and by a pro-McConnell independent group that went up with an ad that called her “Obama’s cheerleader in Kentucky.”McConnell is known for taking the fight to his political opponents and he quickly welcomed Grimes to the race by linking her to the president who is unpopular in Kentucky a red state in presidential elections.“Accepting the invitation from countless Washington liberals to become President Obama’s Kentucky candidate was a courageous decision by Alison Lundergan Grimes and I look forward to a respectful exchange of ideas” McConnell said in a statement this month.In her video Grimes fired back saying “I don’t scare easy.”Next weekend both Grimes and McConnell will attend the annual Fancy Farm picnic in the rural western tip of Kentucky. The picnic is famous as a traditional political gathering that attracts statewide candidates.Also expected to attend that gathering is Matt Bevins a Kentucky businessman who a few days ago formally launched a conservative primary challenge to McConnell adding more political fire to an already combustible race.Conservative challenger takes on McConnell3. House GOP to make another statementPegged to the scandal involving Internal Revenue Service targeting some political groups for special scrutiny the GOP-controlled House of Representatives will vote on a series of bills in the week ahead to curb the power of the IRS and other federal agencies.House Majority Leader Eric Cantor packaged 10 measures for floor votes and dubbed the final week before a monthlong summer recess as “Stop Government Abuse” week.Republicans to make big push on oversight legislationIn addition to the IRS another chief target of the Republican legislative push is Obamacare which the House GOP has continually tried to roll back.One bill sponsored by Rep. Tom Price R-Georgia would prohibit the IRS from implementing any provisions of the health care law. Since the IRS is the agency that would enforce the mandate that individuals must carry health insurance this legislation essentially hamstrings the program. This bill is the latest in a string of more than three dozen times House Republicans have tried to repeal entirely or change parts of the health care law.House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi criticized the effort saying “It is only fitting that Republicans would waste the last week at work this summer voting for the 40th time to repeal the Affordable Care Act and continue their record of no jobs bills no budget agreement and no solutions for the middle class.”Many Republicans expressed outrage after IRS employee Lois Lerner was placed on administrative leave but is still being paid which the current law allows. A GOP bill sponsored by Rep. Mike Kelly R-Pennsylvania would change that law and allow federal agencies to suspend employees who are under investigation without pay. Other Republican bills would limit bonuses for federal workers and impose a ban on any new IRS conferences until new changes are in place.One topic the House won’t address before its five-week break is immigration reform. The Senate passed a bipartisan comprehensive immigration bill last month but Boehner said instead the House will take a “step-by-step” approach but has not given any details yet on when it will vote or what specific measures will be taken up on the floor.4. Scandals from coast …It’s the tabloid political blockbuster of the summer: Amid falling poll numbers and a rising “sexting” count New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner had a horrible week.Opponent: Weiner is immature disconnected from the truthBut the former seven-term Democratic representative who resigned from Congress two years ago following a similar scandal has so far resisted calls to end his bid for a second chance in politics.All eyes will be on Weiner in the days ahead. Will Weiner’s poll numbers continue to plunge? Will more women who had inappropriate online relationships with Weiner speak out? Will Weiner’s wife Huma Abedin a longtime top adviser to Hillary Clinton continue to support her husband’s bid for political redemption?Weiner acknowledged Sunday that campaign manager Danny Kedem has left his team.A lot of questions remain and as of now Weiner’s still giving answers.Weiner says he has no response to Sidney Leathers“But there’s going to reach a point fairly soon that I’m going to say I think I’ve said enough about it and I’m going to keep just talking about other things” Weiner told reporters Friday.Stay tuned.5. … to coastOn the left coast it’s a similar story as another former Democratic congressman is facing calls to quit. San Diego Mayor Bob Filner is dealing with an explosion of sexual harassment allegations.Filner said Friday he will take a two-week hiatus for “intensive counseling.” His move came one day after fellow Democrats called for his resignation.Amid calls to resign embattled Filner to enter clinicSaying he had apologized to his staff the citizens and the “women I have offended” the mayor said “It is simply not acceptable to explain away my conduct as the product of the standards of a different generation.”On Thursday the San Diego County Democratic Party voted 34-6 to ask the mayor to step down. Seven women have said they were targets of the mayor’s advances.A group has begun a campaign aimed at getting more than the 100000 signatures needed to try and recall Filner who was a five-term congressman before being elected mayor last year.CNN’s Tricia Escobedo Craig Broffman and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report,1
284,"APThe agency spent %2450M on at least 220 conferences between 2010 and 2012One speaker was paid %2417%2C000 to discuss %27leadership through art%27IRS employees told investigators Washington officials told them to scrutinize conservative groupsWASHINGTON (AP) — A government watchdog has found that the Internal Revenue Service spent about $50 million to hold at least 220 conferences for employees between 2010 and 2012 a House committee said Sunday.The chairman of that committee Rep. Darrell Issa R-Calif. also released excerpts of congressional investigators' interviews with employees of the IRS office in Cincinnati. Issa said the interviews indicated the employees were directed by Washington to subject tea party and other conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status to tough scrutiny.The excerpts provided no direct evidence that Washington had ordered that screening. The top Democrat on that panel Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland said none of the employees interviewed have so far identified any IRS officials in Washington as ordering that targeting.The conference spending included $4 million for an August 2010 gathering in Anaheim Calif. for which the agency did not negotiate lower room rates even though that is standard government practice according to a statement by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.Instead some of the 2600 attendees received benefits including baseball tickets and stays in presidential suites that normally cost $1500 to $3500 per night. In addition 15 outside speakers were paid a total of $135000 in fees with one paid $17000 to talk about ""leadership through art"" the House committee said.The report by the Treasury Department's inspector general set to be released Tuesday comes as the IRS already is facing bipartisan criticism after agency officials disclosed they had targeted tea party and other conservative groups.Agency officials and the Obama administration have said that treatment was inappropriate but the political tempest is showing no signs of ebbing and has put the White House on the defensive.Three congressional committees are investigating a Justice Department criminal investigation is under way President Barack Obama has replaced the IRS' acting commissioner and two other top officials have stepped aside.The Treasury Department released a statement Sunday saying the administration ""has already taken aggressive and dramatic action to reduce conference spending.""IRS spokeswoman Michelle Eldridge said Sunday that spending on large agency conferences with 50 or more participants fell from $37.6 million in the 2010 budget year to $4.9 million in 2012. The government's fiscal year begins Oct. 1 the previous calendar year.On Friday the new acting commissioner Danny Werfel released a statement on the forthcoming report criticizing the Anaheim meeting.""This conference is an unfortunate vestige from a prior era"" Werfel said. ""While there were legitimate reasons for holding the meeting many of the expenses associated with it were inappropriate and should not have occurred.""Issa's committee also released excerpts from interviews congressional investigators conducted last week with two IRS employees from the agency's Cincinnati office. The excerpts omitted the names of those interviewed and provided no specifics about individuals in Washington who may have been involved.One of the IRS employees said in an excerpt that they were told by a supervisor that the need to collect the reports came from Washington and said that in early 2010 the Cincinnati office had sent copies of seven of the cases to Washington.The other said ""all my direction"" came from an official the transcript said was in Washington.One of the workers also expressed skepticism that the Cincinnati office originated the screening without direction from Washington according to the excerpts.Appearing Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Issa said this conflicted with White House comments that have referred to misconduct by IRS workers in Cincinnati. Without naming White House spokesman Jay Carney Issa said the administration's ""paid liar their spokesperson"" is ""still making up things about what happens in calling this local rogue.""He added ""This is a problem that was coordinated in all likelihood right out of Washington headquarters and we're getting to proving it.""In briefings with reporters Carney has not referred to the Cincinnati IRS office as ""rogue.""""He's good at throwing out outlandish charges but it's unclear what he's saying he lied about"" White House spokesman Eric Schultz said of Issa's remark.Cummings said Issa's comments conflicted with a Treasury inspector general's report that provided no evidence that the Cincinnati office received orders on targeting from anyone else.""Rather than lobbing unsubstantiated conclusions on national television for political reasons we need to work in a bipartisan way to follow the facts where they lead"" Cummings said.The interviews with IRS employees were conducted by Republican and Democratic aides on Issa's committee and also involved aides from both parties from the House Ways and Means Committee.One of the employees was a lower-level worker while the other was higher-ranked said one congressional aide but the committee did not release their names or titles.The IRS Cincinnati office handles applications from around the country for tax-exempt status. A Treasury inspector general's report in May said employees there began searching for applications from tea party and conservative groups in their hunt for organizations that primarily do work related to election campaigns.That May report blamed ""ineffective management"" for letting that screening occur for more than 18 months between 2010 and 2012. But that report — and three hearings by congressional committees — have produced no specific evidence that the Cincinnati workers were ordered by anyone in Washington to target conservatives.The latest report on IRS conferences will be the subject of a hearing Thursday by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.Werfel is scheduled to make his first congressional appearance as acting commissioner Monday when he appears before a subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee.According to congressional aides briefed by the inspector general's office the IRS did not formally seek competitive bids for the city where the agency's 2010 conference was held for the event planner who assisted the agency or for the speakers.The aides who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe a confidential congressional briefing said other benefits given to some attendees at the Anaheim IRS conference included vouchers for free drinks and some tickets to attend Angels baseball games.Two videos produced by the IRS were shown at the Anaheim conference. In one agency employees did a parody of ""Star Trek"" while dressed like the TV show's characters; the second shows more than a dozen IRS workers dancing on a stage. The two videos cost the agency more than $50000 to make aides said.The lecturer who spoke about leadership through art produced six paintings of subjects that included Abraham Lincoln Michael Jordan the rock singer Bono and the Statue of Liberty the aides said.",1
285,More voters have a positive opinion of former President George W. Bush than President Barack Obama according to the latest Fox News Poll. But former President Bill Clinton is liked best of the three.The poll finds 50 percent of voters have a favorable opinion of Bush while 47 percent have an unfavorable view.By contrast Obama has a net negative rating: 46 percent have a favorable opinion of him while 52 percent have an unfavorable opinion.Views of Clinton are far more positive: 70 percent favorable vs. 26 percent unfavorable. That gives him a huge net positive rating (+ 44 points).The two former presidents and President Obama attended the memorial service for South African leader Nelson Mandela on December 11 and Bush joined Obama on Air Force One for the flight to Johannesburg.Obama’s favorable rating has been more positive than negative for almost his entire presidency. However in the last few months during the botched health care roll-out opinion of Obama has reversed.At the end of Bush’s second term he had a 34 percent favorable rating (December 2008) but that’s been increasing the last few years during his retirement.There’s a large partisan gap in views of Obama and Bush; for example there’s an 80-point difference in Obama’s favorable rating among Democrats and Republicans. And there’s a 60-point gap in Bush’s positive rating from the two parties.Eighty-five percent of Democrats have a positive view of Obama while just five percent of Republicans feel that way.Likewise 85 percent of Republicans have a favorable opinion of Bush while just 25 percent of Democrats agree.Fully 93 percent of Republicans rate Obama negatively. In contrast Bush’s unfavorable drops to 74 percent among Democrats.Presidential Job Performance ComparisonsPresident Obama ends his fifth year in office under water on his job rating by 12 percentage points: 41 percent of voters approve of the job he’s doing while 53 percent disapprove.President Bush ended his fifth year in office in negative territory too by nine points: 42 percent approved of his job performance and 51 percent disapproved in the Fox News poll conducted mid-December 2005.Obama’s average approval rating for 2013 is 44 percent just slightly below the 2005 average approval of 46 percent for Bush.The Fox News poll is based on landline and cell phone interviews with 1027 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from December 14-16 2013. The full poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.,1
286,"A trucker protest aimed at clogging the Capital Beltway around Washington to protest government ""corruption"" was not shaping up to be quite the commuter nightmare organizers had threatened.As of Friday morning dozens of tractor-trailers were said to be on the road as part of the protest convoy.Virginia state police say they stopped four tractor-trailer drivers on the Beltway pulling them over after they began driving side-by side across all four northbound lanes of the Beltway in Fairfax County.Their actions slowed traffic to about 15 mph. Officers warned the drivers not to impede traffic and did not write any tickets.Police say a convoy of about 30 trucks began traveling north on Interstate 95 from Doswell Va. on Friday morning. The truckers are circling the Beltway.However the presence was not quite the thousands of truckers that organizers had predicted. On Friday morning just a handful of people had showed up at a key staging area.According to MyFoxDC.com organizers say more could show up through the weekend.The rally ""Truckers Ride for the Constitution"" had called for 10000 truck drivers to show up Friday morning and circle I-495 for the next three days according to a Facebook page for the event.""Truckers will lead the path to saving our country if every American rides with them!"" the Facebook page says adding ""The American people are sick and tired of the corruption that is destroying America!""On its website the group lists several demands including that President Obama resign immediately that the debt ceiling not be raised and that National Security Agency surveillance of communications be ceased. The group is also complaining about low wages and rising fuel costs.The event's organizers however have stressed that they intend to keep the protest peaceful and adhere to all traffic laws.""We're not coming in to cause any violence or disrupt anything"" protester J.B. Schaffner told Greta Van Sustern Thursday night on ""Greta.""""We're just coming in to make our voice heard.""The Associated Press contributed to this report.",1
287,An investigation by Cincinnati Fox 19 reporter Ben Swann finds that Obama Administration claims that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) targeting of conservative groups was the work of two “rogue” low-level employees in Cincinnati Ohio strain credulity and are “falling apart.”Swann reports that so far six IRS agents working out of the Cincinnati office–which is the central hub for processing tax-exempt applications–have been identified as sending scrutinizing letters to conservative groups. These include:Mitchel Steele-IRS AgentCarly Young-IRS AgentJoseph Herr-IRS AgentStephen Seok-IRS SupervisorLiz Hofacre-IRS AgentMs. Richards (full name unknown)-IRS AgentThese agents report to different managers with a territory manager overseeing those managers.Swann explains how the process works:When an application for tax exempt status comes into the IRS agents have 270 days to work through that application. If the application is not processed within those 270 days it automatically triggers flags in the system. When that happens individual agents are required to input a status update on that individual case once a month every month until the case is resolved. Keep in mind at least 300 groups were targeted out of Cincinnati alone. Those applications spent anywhere from 18 months to nearly 3 years in the system and some still don’t have their non-profit status. 300 groups multiplied by at least 18 months for each group means thousands of red flags would have been generated in the system. So who in the chain of command would have received all these flags? The answer according to the IRS directory one woman in Cincinnati Cindy Thomas the Program Manager of the Tax Exempt Division. Because all six of our IRS workers have different individual and territory managers Cindy Thomas is one manager they all have common. It turns out Cindy Thomas’ name is one we have heard before. The independent journalism group ProPublica says in November of 2012 they had requested information on conservatives groups that had received non-profit status.Cindy Thomas says Swann is the highest-ranking employee in the Tax Exempt and Government Entities Department in Cincinnati.Democrats unleashed a barrage of pointed questions to IRS officials on Wednesday in the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing. Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-MA) said if witnesses today are not more forthcoming and continue to stonewall the committee “it will lead to a special prosecutor” in order “to get to the bottom of this.” He warned that “there will be hell to pay if that’s the route we go down.”“It is possible that criminal activity may have occurred” said Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration J. Russell George.,1

Four predicted Obama will nominate Larry Summers his former economic adviser and President Clinton's Treasury secretary.The survey was done last week amid a flurry of media reports suggesting that the field was narrowing to a choice between Yellen and Summers or that Summers was the front-runner.The White House has said only that a decision will be made in the fall. In an interview with The New York Times published over the weekend Obama said he has narrowed his choice to ""some extraordinary candidates."" Treasury Secretary Jack Lew declined to express a preference in an interview on ABC's This Week on Sunday.Yellen is ""extremely well-qualified and she's been there through the (financial) crisis"" says Diane Swonk chief economist of Mesirow Financial. ""We need continuity.""Vincent Reinhart chief U.S. economist of Morgan Stanley and former head of monetary affairs at the Fed thinks Obama will pick Summers.""The president really has tended to reward loyalty"" Reinhart says ""and Summers has that history with the president that Yellen doesn't.""The presumptive horse race between Yellen and Summers to be the nation's top economist has transfixed Washington in a uneventful political summer even though the White House says a nominee won't be announced until fall.After reports last week that Summers may be emerging as the favorite Senate Democrats began a petition in support of Yellen and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi endorsed her in a Bloomberg Television interview. ""It would be great to have a woman"" Pelosi said.Bernanke hasn't said whether he plans to step down when his second four-year term ends in January but his departure is widely expected.The Fed chairman is the most influential voice on a policymaking committee that can speed up or slow down U.S. economic growth by lowering or raising interest rates among other moves that ripple across the global economy.Yellen 66 chaired the Council of Economic Advisors under Clinton and headed the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank for six years before becoming vice chairwoman of the Fed's board of governors in 2010.Obama likely would relish the opportunity to nominate the first female Fed chief says Nariman Behravesh chief economist of IHS.Like Bernanke Yellen has used a collegial style to push through bold programs by building consensus on the Fed's politically diverse Federal Open Market Committee.""She convinces people through the strength of her argument but she's not argumentative"" says Swonk with Mesirow Financial.Summers 58 is widely regarded as brilliant but sometimes arrogant. ""Summers doesn't play nicely with others"" Swonk says. ""Congress doesn't like him."" As Treasury secretary she says he took part in the 1990s banking industry deregulation that led to the 2008 financial crisis.Reinhart says criticism of Summers as domineering is overstated noting he held senior positions in two administrations that required him to work with colleagues.As Obama's chief economic adviser in his first term Summers was a key architect of the policies that helped pull the nation from recession and he is viewed as having a steady hand in a crisis.Most telling Reinhart says is that the White House apparently is floating Summers' name. ""But we haven't heard anything that can really be construed as a trial balloon about Yellen"" he says.",1
289,"POINT PLEASANT BEACH N.J. (AP) — President Barack Obama casually tossed a football as Gov. Chris Christie won a stuffed bear in an arcade Tuesday along a New Jersey boardwalk signaling the famed Jersey Shore is back seven months after Hurricane Sandy bore down with force.Obama with a left-handed soft toss went 0 for 5. Christie scored a hit on the first try prompting a high-five from the president.""That's because he's running for office"" Obama joked a nod to the Republican governor's re-election campaign and the perception that Obama's visit helps Christie in Democratic-leaning New Jersey.The odd couple of politics Christie and Obama found common cause in Point Pleasant Beach where about half the boardwalk was destroyed in the storm. Christie held back as Obama dodging rain in a blue rain jacket worked a rope line shaking hands with a crowd that gathered for his arrival.The trip gives Obama a chance to showcase the widely praised Federal Emergency Management Agency at a time when attention has focused on the Internal Revenue Service and its targeting of conservative groups. The president also gets to draw attention to the kind of bipartisanship that has been harder to find in the nation's capital.White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters traveling to New Jersey with Obama that the president believes Christie ""has done an excellent job in the efforts he's undertaken.""For Christie the president's appearance is yet another way to showcase his beloved Jersey Shore. The Republican governor has been touting it throughout the Memorial Day weekend as a destination point that is back in business and he broke a Guinness world record Friday by cutting a 5.5-mile-long ceremonial ribbon that symbolically tied together some of the towns hardest-hit by Sandy. The state has a $25 million marketing campaign to highlight the shore's resurgence in time for the summer season.Both men will reprise the remarkable bipartisan tableau they offered during Sandy's immediate aftermath when Obama flew to New Jersey just days before the November election to witness the storm's wreckage. Politically the visit plays well for both men. Christie seeking re-election this year will stand shoulder to shoulder with a president popular among Democrats in a Democratic-leaning state. And Obama dueling with congressional Republicans on a number of fronts gets to display common cause with a popular GOP stalwart. (Obama was not scheduled to meet with state Sen. Barbara Buono Christie's likely Democratic opponent in the governor's race.)Story continuesChristie in an interview with NBC on Friday played down the politics even when asked whether ties to Obama could hurt him among conservatives if he were to seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2016.""The fact of the matter is he's the president of the United States and he wants to come here and see the people of New Jersey"" Christie said. ""I'm the governor. I'll be here to welcome him.""To be sure New Jersey is still rebuilding. Obama is visiting those regions that have been among the first to recover — Christie ranks the recovery of the state's famous boardwalks as an eight on a scale of 10 but concedes that in other parts of the state many homeowners are still rebuilding six months after the devastating superstorm struck. Overall the storm caused $38 billion in damages in the state and harmed or wrecked 360000 homes or apartment units.But the coastal recovery is a big potential boon for the state where tourism is a nearly $40 billion industry.For Obama coming off a week that had the IRS in the crosshairs of a scandal the trip also offers an opportunity to demonstrate the work of FEMA whose response to disasters has been met with bipartisan praise.Indeed inside the White House FEMA is perceived as an example of what's best about government. The agency panned for its response under President George W. Bush to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 has made a turnaround under administrator Craig Fugate and has been commended for its work in disasters from the Joplin Mo. tornado in 2011 to Sandy last year.The visit also occurs as Congress is away for a Memorial Day break a weeklong recess that likely will silence the daily attention lawmakers particularly Republicans had been paying to the IRS political upheaval as well as the ongoing debate about the fatal attacks at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi Libya last year and an investigation of media leaks that has stirred opposition from the media and many lawmakers.",1
290,"I also wrote a diary ""Working Age"" Military Retirees Screwed Over in the Ryan/Murray Deal. In it I highlight all those places that Congress could have cut the military budget items that the Pentagon itself wanted to cut and Congress chose not to. Why? Because those cuts would mean ending contracts with companies in their districts. Just.to.hard.to.do.So instead Congress is going to repeat it's 1990-style military retiree screw you over deal. Back then it was health care. Military retirees had been promised a lifetime of free healthcare. They lost it when Congress and President Clinton signed a budget agreement that started to charge retirees for seeing the doctor. They fought back but they fought alone because the civilian community didn't see such a big deal at the time. For 20 years many a military member has cussed out Clinton for his part in all of this. In fact I would say it was one of the major reasons why vocal military opinion swayed against Democrats for so long.Now we're going to see President Obama sign similar legislation. Different retiree benefit but just another generation of military retirees to screw over. Don't think we're getting screwed? Military families certainly do:From a military spouse at MilitarySpouse.com:We’ve embraced many hardships. I’ve sacrificed plenty over the years. I know I personally gave up my career to support my husbands – without regret. My occupation is not portable so I’ll have to start over – someday when I stop moving every two years. My youngest is five years old and she’s already lived in four states. I’ve said goodbye to family knowing we’ll never live in the same state again. Because aren’t all grandparents meant for Skyping and not sleepovers? My children are forced to change schools every two years expected to make new friends and adapt to imbalances in education from state to state. My husband’s office is an intricate part of the national defense of our country. So that means T-ball games are missed so are school plays recitals activities help with home work bed time routines and of course family vacations. Not to mention let’s send you off to a war zone for an unknown amount of time too. My husband has spent 20 years in the United States military. It’s not your typical day job. And quite frankly I think I have it pretty good. I know other military families out there have it a lot worse. I’ve embraced my suck we all do. So when I hear the Minority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi (D) spout out in a news conference we have to “embrace the suck” I want to scream! How about trying out a new slogan “Embrace Your Promise.”So how about it? Are you with us or against us?You can send a letter to your Representative your Senators and President Obama in one single go by visiting the Military Officers Association of America. You don't have to be military just mark that you're an MOAA Family/Friend.And please show the front pagers that this issue is important. Rec the diary and get this issue some attention. Please.",1

292,On Friday Pentagon officials informed a House committee that the President’s formal budget proposal wouldn’t be delivered to Congress until April 8th more than two months past the statutory deadline. Under federal law the President is required to submit his budget blueprint to Congress no later than the first Monday in February. President Obama has met that deadline only once.When asked at a press briefing Friday White House deputy press secretary Josh Earnest wouldn’t confirm the budget’s release. “I don’t have a budget date to announce to you” he said. It is telling that the White House didn’t inform Congress of the delay but left the task to budget staff at the Pentagon.A major part of a President’s job is to manage the Executive Branch and its numerous federal agencies. The President’s budget proposal is the Administration’s estimation of the resources it will need to meet its mission and priorities for the coming year. Historically the President submits his budget before Congress gets to work on a final spending plan.This year however House and Senate Budget authors will unveil their spending plans weeks ahead of President Obama. Like many other legislative deliberations Obama will be on the sidelines.Senate Budget Committee Ranking Member Sen. Jeff Sessions blasted the delay. “He will be submitting it after the House and Senate have produced a budget proposal and adjourned for Easter. So while the President speaks of his deep concern for American workers and families he fails to even submit to Congress his financial plan to help those workers and families.”Since Obama took office the government has mostly been on auto-pilot. Senate Democrats have refused for the past four years to even bring a budget plan to the floor for a vote. This inaction has caused the government to run on a series of “continuing resolutions” which simply extend all current spending with modest increases for a set period of time.As a result there have been no real talks about prioritizing spending nor reducing or eliminating ineffective programs. It has allowed Obama and the Democrats to give lip-service to the need to cut spending without having to provide any specific recommendations. It’s budgetary shadow-boxing.Obama is simply uninterested in the day-to-day workload required to successfully manage the federal government. He can’t even be bothered when federal law requires that he “show his work” to the nation.Follow me on twitter,1
293,Of all the arguments for the Obama administration’s green-energy loan program one of the worst is that federal aid leverages private capital.Consider Fisker Automotive. In August 2009 this wannabe plug-in electric hybrid car company was hard up for cash to pay suppliers and faced potential layoffs.A green-energy loan was the only hope Fisker executive Bernhard Koehler explained in an e-mail to the Department of Energy — because it would help bring in private money. “We are oversubscribed in this equity round with the DOE support — and nowhere without it” Koehler pleaded.A month later in September 2009 the Energy Department approved a $529 million low-interest loan. Vice President Biden stood before the proposed site of a Fisker plant in Delaware and described the department’s program as “seed money that will return back to the American consumer in billions and billions and billions of dollars of good new jobs.”Sure enough private money started flowing in to Fisker by the tens of millions. Apparently investors liked the idea of a firm that enjoyed access to cheap government funding.1 of 50 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles goes green View Photos A collection of cartoons about the environment and global warming. Caption A collection of cartoons on the environment and climate change. Wait 1 second to continue.All told Fisker attracted $1.1 billion in private investment the vast majority of which took place after it got the DOE loan.Alas government loans could not overcome Fisker’s fundamental problem: no experience mass-producing automobiles let alone the complex battery-powered luxury cars that it proposed to sell for more than $100000. Today the company is nearly bankrupt; taxpayers are on the hook for $171 million and private investors are probably nearly wiped out. (The story is well told with documents at PrivCo.com.)In other words that’s more than a billion dollars in capital that can’t create jobs elsewhere in the economy — but might have if the government had not propped up and promoted Fisker.A committee of the Republican-majority House is searching for proof that Fisker got its loan because of its political connections. It’s certainly true that the Silicon Valley venture capital (VC) firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers was Fisker’s biggest backer and that KPCB’s lineup includes such Democratic heavies as John Doerr and Al Gore.I doubt the committee will find a smoking gun though. This is a story of self-serving groupthink not a blatant quid pro quo. Fisker’s fool’s gold took in members of the U.S. elite from Leonardo DiCaprio to KPCB “strategic limited partner” Colin Powell. For the private investors Fisker was about getting rich while feeling virtuous. For the Obama administration it was about doing something for green jobs. The former will be held accountable financially; the latter politically.That doesn’t make the Fisker debacle a victimless episode or a disaster only in the sense of opportunity cost. State university endowments and charitable foundations had exposure through KPCB investment funds. The College Illinois fund a state-run prepaid tuition plan used by 30000 families sank $10 million into Fisker. It did so at the urging of Advanced Equities Inc. (AEI) a Chicago-based firm that Fisker paid to raise private capital after the Energy Department loan.AEI did not enjoy a sterling reputation. A 2008 Forbes article portrayed it as an oft-sued operation notorious for foisting dubious VC deals on its clientele. An anonymous ex-employee called it “a bucket shop.”AEI eventually raised more than half of Fisker’s private capital. “They are good at what they do” Fisker board member (and KPCB partner) Ray Lane no relation told the Wall Street Journal. (Through a spokeswoman Lane declined a request for an interview.)San Diego businessman Daniel Wray typifies the investors AEI pulled in. He spent $210000 on preferred shares prior to January 2012 — when AEI told him that his stake would be downgraded to common stock unless he ponied up $84000 more within a week.Wray is suing claiming that AEI took him by surprise — though it must be said that such “pay to play” gambits are not unprecedented in the VC biz especially in “late-stage” start-ups desperate for cash as Fisker was in early 2012.Last September Advanced Equities paid the Securities and Exchange Commission $1 million to settle fraud charges related to its fundraising for another KPCB-backed green start-up Bloom Energy. Allegedly one of AEI’s top officials told would-be investors that the CIA had ordered $2 billion of its fuel cells which it hadn’t. Advanced Equities shut down last year.Government can efficiently affect energy usage through fuel taxes and basic research. When it intervenes on behalf of specific technologies and specific companies however bad things happen — resource misallocation windfall-seeking even sometimes corruption. The Fisker debacle proves once again that in the immortal words of former White House economist Larry Summers “government is a crappy VC.”charles.lane@washpost.com,1
294,WASHINGTON — For Lawrence H. Summers President Obama’s preferred candidate to lead the Federal Reserve the messy debate over a military attack in Syria was the final sign.After weeks of opposition to his candidacy from an array of progressives the president’s inability to rally Congressional Democrats on Syria persuaded Mr. Summers that his most important audience — the Senate which must confirm a Fed chairman — probably could not be won over.He concluded that the White House was also unlikely to overcome opposition to his candidacy from many of the same Democrats who view him as an opponent of stronger financial regulation according to supporters who insisted on anonymity to describe confidential conversations with him.“Clearly Obama couldn’t bring his own most enthusiastic supporters to back him on an issue of national security” one supporter said. “How was he going to corral them for Larry?”,1
295,"Editor's Note: An earlier version of this story incorrectly estimated that the annual cost to the White House for paying its interns would be $7.3 million. That estimate incorrectly assumed that all 300 interns work 52 weeks per year.The White House may not be able to afford to pay its interns.While pressure has been mounting for President Obama to pay his interns there could be a reason why the White House hasn't ponied up: It would cost more than $2.5 million a year.That's about what the White House paid to give tours of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. which were infamously halted in March due to forced spending cuts.Related: White House urged to pay internsThe figure assumes Obama would pay his interns $9 an hour the number he suggested the minimum wage should be raised to during his State of the Union address in January.The White House has said it employs more than 300 interns each year with 150 this summer alone and ""more than 100"" in the fall and spring semesters. Each intern is expected to work 45 hours per week.We assumed the White House would be paying 125 interns at $9 per hour for 50 weeks per year.The figure can be taken two ways. On the one hand it means the White House is getting $2.5 million of free work each year. On the other it is a relatively large amount of money to shell out at a time when the White House is being forced to cut back on many expenses.Related: Spending cuts likely deeper in 2014That may give pause to the interns who are calling on Obama to set an example by paying them.The Fair Pay Campaign a grassroots lobby set to launch around Labor Day has said that not paying interns creates a situation where only a privileged few can afford to work there -- it can cost several thousands of dollars to cover rent and other living expenses while not getting paid.""If you want to break into these industries you have to work for free"" said Mikey Franklin the leader of Fair Pay's charge. ""That's not a reality for a lot of people who aren't upper middle class.""The White House was not immediately available for comment.",1

297,Lawrence H. Summers the former Treasury secretary and senior White House economic adviser has withdrawn as a candidate for Federal Reserve chairman in a startling development that raises urgent questions about who will lead the central bank when Chairman Ben S. Bernanke steps down in four months.Summers withdrew after an intense uproar among liberal Democrats women’s groups and other advocacy organizations against his potential nomination — a highly unusual assault on the candidate who President Obama favored for the job.Obama has said he is considering two other candidates for the post Fed Vice Chairman Janet L. Yellen and former Fed vice chairman Don Kohn. But he was leaning toward picking Summers people close to the White House say and the economist’s decision to take his name out of the ring might lead Obama to pursue a wider range of candidates.Summers helped Obama navigate the depths of the financial crisis and recession providing a degree of support that Obama has told aides he deeply valued. No official with the possible exception of former Treasury secretary Timothy F. Geithner did more to influence the president’s response to the traumatic events he faced at the beginning of his term which Obama plans to highlight this week as he marks the fifth anniversary of the financial crisis.On Sunday Summers telephoned the president to tell him he was withdrawing his name from consideration.“It has been a privilege to work with you since the beginning of your Administration as you led the nation through a severe recession into a sustained economic recovery” Summers wrote in a letter to the president.He added: “This is a complex moment in our national life. I have reluctantly concluded that any possible confirmation process for me would be acrimonious and would not serve the interest of the Federal Reserve the Administration or ultimately the interests of the nation’s ongoing economic recovery.”Obama accepted Summers’s decision lauding him and saying that he planned to continue to consult his former adviser.“Larry was a critical member of my team as we faced down the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression and it was in no small part because of his expertise wisdom and leadership that we wrestled the economy back to growth and made the kind of progress we are seeing today” Obama said. “I will always be grateful to Larry for his tireless work and service on behalf of his country.”The decision marks a disappointing turn of events for the renowned economist who had operated at the highest levels of academia and government. But he has been dogged by controversies. Summers has come under fire for his support for deregulating parts of the banking sector while he was Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton. While president of Harvard University in 2005 he also sparked controversy for his comments on women’s aptitude in math and science.People close to the White House said Summers faced not only a rebellion among liberal Democrats but also other challenges including a debate over whether to launch a military strike against Syria that stretched out the Fed process and gave more time for opposition to build.“It was just a perfect storm of bad timing” said one person close to the White House who requested anonymity in order to speak candidly about private deliberations. “It would have been absolute war and the president would have had to spend all of his political capital. Larry decided not to drag him through it.”The contest for Fed chairman had taken on the form of a political campaign this summer as allies of Summers and Yellen advanced their cases in the news media — and in behind-the-scenes whispering campaigns.A wide array of current and former Obama officials backed Summers arguing that his crisis experience and economic prowess made him an exceptional candidate. Yellen’s supporters meanwhile noted that she has deep Fed experience and has been an architect of the central bank’s efforts to reduce unemployment.The drama started after word of Summers’s candidacy first circulated early this summer — when most Fed watchers thought Yellen would be appointed.Liberals on Capitol Hill as well as a wide array of economists erupted. They said he had a brusque personality that would be problematic at the Fed.Summers’s allies took to the media noting that he was an architect of the president’s push for tough financial regulations after the crisis and couldn’t be so difficult to work with if he had garnered the support of so many of his White House colleagues.When questioned on Capitol Hill Obama made many of the same points in defense of his former adviser. But given the heated opposition Obama decided to announce publicly that he would wait until the fall to make a decision hoping to buy time and cool tensions.Some former administration officials say in retrospect that the White House got the strategy wrong. While the noise from Capitol Hill died down for a while — and Senate leadership privately told the White House it would do all it could to get Summers through — key voices in the opposition grew louder.In the past week Democratic Sens. Jon Tester (Mont.) and Sherrod Brown (Ohio) members of the banking committee which would have had to endorse Summers announced that they would vote against him. Another committee Democrat Sen. Jeff Merkely (Ore.) had said long ago that he would oppose Summers and it was widely assumed that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) would have joined them as well.That would have meant that Obama would have had to court Republicans to get Summers confirmed — a difficult task at the same time he would be trying to strip away Republican support for a deal to keep the government open and raise the federal borrowing limits.“The truth is that it was unlikely he would have been confirmed by the Senate” said Sen. Bernard Sanders (I-Vt.) a liberal who said he would have voted against Summers if he was approved by the Senate banking committee.Obama is now short on time to make a nomination given that the Senate often takes a few months for confirmation. While some speculated Sunday that Obama might turn to Geithner a person close to the former Treasury secretary said he does not want to be considered.The decision may give a lift to markets which were concerned about the uncertainty surrounding the Fed nomination process and the perception that Summers would have been less supportive of the Fed’s efforts to reduce unemployment.“This news should be positive for the markets” said Millan Mulraine director of U.S. rates research at TD Securities. “We could see a rally.”Summers’s friends expressed regret that the perception of him has been more caricature than reality arguing that he would have pushed the Fed strongly to reduce unemployment and to demand more transparency in the financial system.,1
298,With budgetary tantrums in the Senate and investigative play-acting in the House the Republican Party is proving once again that it simply cannot be taken seriously.This is a shame. I don’t share the GOP’s philosophy but I do believe that competition makes both of our major parties smarter. I also believe that a big complicated country facing economic and geopolitical challenges needs a government able to govern.What we don’t need is the steady diet of obstruction diversion and gamesmanship that Republicans are trying to ram down the nation’s throat. It’s not as if President Obama and the Democrats are doing everything right. It’s just that the GOP shrinks from doing anything meaningful at all.The most glaring example at the moment is in the Senate. For four years Republican senators lambasted their Democratic colleagues — with justification — for not approving a budget one of the basic tasks of governance. Sen. John Cornyn(R-Tex.) and others regularly took to the Senate floor to announce the number of days since the body last produced a spending plan and to blast Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) for this shocking failure.Two months ago Reid and the Democrats finally passed a budget. Since the House has already passed its version — the controversial plan authored by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) — the next step should be for both chambers to appoint members of a conference committee that would iron out the differences. But Republicans won’t let this happen.1 of 171 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Republicans View Photos A collection of cartoons about the GOP.

Establishment types such as John McCain of Arizona are apoplectic at the antics of their tea party-inspired colleagues which McCain called “absolutely out of line and unprecedented.”Cruz and the others are worried that a conference committee might not only work out a budget but also make it possible to raise the federal debt ceiling without the now-customary showdown threatening default and catastrophe. They believe that brinkmanship is the only way to stop runaway government spending which produces massive trillion-dollar deficits which add to the ballooning national debt which . . .Hold on senator. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office the deficit is shrinking rapidly and will fall to $642 billion this fiscal year. That’s still substantial but it’s less than half the deficit our government ran in 2011. More important if annual deficits continue to decline as the CBO predicts the long-term debt problem begins to look more manageable. That’s good news right?What Republicans ought to do is declare a victory for fiscal conservatism and move on to the battle to have their priorities reflected in the budget — a promising fight since the conferees appointed by the GOP-controlled House are hardly going to be flaming liberals. Instead the party seeks not consensus but crisis.This is no way for a 2-year-old to act much less the self-proclaimed “world’s greatest deliberative body.”And speaking of juvenile behavior I would be remiss not to mention how Rep. Darrell Issa of California and his GOP colleagues in the House are embarrassing themselves by straining to turn Obama administration missteps into Watergate-style scandals.Ann Telnaes animation: Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) proposes nationwide ban on abortions after 20 weeks. (Ann Telnaes/The Washington Post)The deaths of four Americans in Benghazi Libya resulted from a security lapse of the kind that every recent administration unfortunately has suffered. Since future administrations will have lapses as well congressional oversight could be useful in at least making sure the specific mistakes of Benghazi are not repeated. But instead House Republicans summon the television cameras and ask round after round of tendentious questions — without paying the slightest attention to the answers.Similarly on the question of how and why the IRS gave added scrutiny to conservative “social welfare” groups seeking nonprofit status House inquisitors seem barely interested in what actually happened. “What did the president know and when did he know it?” was an appropriate question. But the follow-up — “Harrumph well then why didn’t he know sooner?” — isn’t much in the way of scandal material.And concerning the Justice Department’s overzealous crusade to thwart classified leaks — and investigative reporting — it is amusing to watch House Republicans twist themselves into champions of the hated Lamestream Media. Who knew?None of this is boosting the GOP’s poll numbers.

Revenues%2C however%2C are not.Does that mean that the ballooning debt is all Obama%27s fault%3F No.The United States can%27t go on forever increasing its debt by 60%25 every four years.President Obama the Democrats and plenty of Republicans in Congress would like it if you'd spend the next few weeks talking about gun control. That's because when you are you're not talking about the country's financial situation.And as the graph included here taken from OMB budget data illustrates the situation is dire. Spending keeps going up. Revenues however are not. And since we're borrowing the difference President Obama has what Politico is calling a debt problem: ""The staggering national debt — up about 60% from the $10 trillion Obama inherited when he took office in January 2009 — is the single biggest blemish on Obama's record even if the rapid descent into red began under President George W. Bush. Obama has long emphasized Bush's role in digging the immense hole. But he owns it now.""Well things did start to go south under Bush. But look at that graph more closely. In 2003 when we invaded Iraq (one of those ""two wars on the credit card"" that Obama likes to blame for the debt) and when we passed the Bush tax cuts (the other thing Obama likes to blame for the debt) revenue actually started to climb. The revenue and spending lines start to converge and as they head up to 2006 it actually looks as if the two might cross with revenue outpacing spending.Even the New York Times noticed spotting unexpected increases in revenue in 2005 and in 2006 noting that a ""surprising"" increase in tax revenues was closing the budget gap. The heady possibility of surpluses was in the air. But -- look at the graph again -- everything changes in 2007.What happened in 2007? The financial crisis hadn't struck yet. But we did elect a new Democratic Congress with Democrats controlling both houses for the first time in over a decade. The trend immediately reversed and became much worse with President Obama's election in 2008 and inauguration in 2009. (In fact despite talk of ""wars on the credit card"" we could save a lot of money by cutting defense spending back to where it was in 2007.)So does that mean that the ballooning debt is all Obama's fault? No. Most of those spending bills got Republican votes too. But it does mean that as Politico notes Obama now owns the 60% increase in the debt that has occurred on his watch and can no longer credibly blame Bush (under whom plenty of Democrats voted for spending bills).Economist Herbert Stein observed that something that can't go on forever won't. The United States can't go on forever increasing its debt by 60% every four years. Therefore it won't. The only question is how things will stop -- smoothly or catastrophically.As we head into the next debt-ceiling debate it's worth considering these words from a patriotic senator concerned with America's future:""The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. . . . It is a sign that the U.S. government can't pay its own bills. It is a sign that we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to finance our government's reckless fiscal policies. … Leadership means that 'the buck stops here.' Instead Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better. I therefore intend to oppose the effort to increase America's debt limit.""The senator? Sen.

300,"WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration appears to have almost no international support for controversial new trade standards that would grant radical new political powers to corporations increase the cost of prescription medications and restrict bank regulation according to two internal memos obtained by The Huffington Post.The memos which come from a government involved in the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade negotiations detail continued disputes in the talks over the deal. The documents reveal broad disagreement over a host of key positions and general skepticism that an agreement can be reached by year-end. The Obama administration has urged countries to reach a deal by New Year's Day though there is no technical deadline.One memo which was heavily redacted before being provided to HuffPost was written ahead of a new round of talks in Singapore this week. Read the full text of what HuffPost received here. (Note: Ellipses indicate redacted text. Text in brackets has been added by a third party.) Another document a chart outlining different country positions on the text dates from early November before the round of negotiations in Salt Lake City Utah. View the chart here. HuffPost was unable to determine which of the 11 non-U.S. nations involved in the talks was responsible for the memo.""These are not U.S. documents and we have no idea of their authorship or authenticity"" a spokesman for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said. ""Some elements in them are outdated others totally inaccurate."" The spokesman declined to specify which parts were outdated or inaccurate.The Obama administration has been leading negotiations on the international trade accord since 2010. The countries involved in the talks include Australia Brunei Chile Canada Japan Malaysia Mexico New Zealand Peru Singapore and Vietnam.One of the most controversial provisions in the talks includes new corporate empowerment language insisted upon by the U.S. government which would allow foreign companies to challenge laws or regulations in a privately run international court. Under World Trade Organization treaties this political power to contest government law is reserved for sovereign nations. The U.S. has endorsed some corporate political powers in prior trade agreements including the North American Free Trade Agreement but the scope of what laws can be challenged appears to be much broader in TPP negotiations.""The United States as in previous rounds has shown no flexibility on its proposal being one of the most significant barriers to closing the chapter since under the concept of Investment Agreement nearly all significant contracts that can be made between a state and a foreign investor are included"" the memo reads. ""Only the U.S. and Japan support the proposal.""Under NAFTA companies including Exxon Mobil Dow Chemical and Eli Lilly have attempted to overrule Canadian regulations on offshore oil drilling fracking pesticides drug patents and other issues. Companies could challenge an even broader array of rules under the TPP language.New standards concerning access to key medicines appear to be equally problematic for many nations. The Obama administration is insisting on mandating new intellectual property rules in the treaty that would grant pharmaceutical companies long-term monopolies on new medications. As a result companies can charge high prices without regard to competition from generic providers. The result public health experts have warned would be higher prices around the world and lack of access to life-saving drugs in poor countries. Nearly every intellectual property issue in the November chart is opposed by a broad majority of the 12 nations. The December memo describes 119 ""outstanding issues"" that remain unresolved between the nations on intellectual property matters. The deal would obligate nations to develop many standards similar to those in the United States where domestic prescription drug prices are much higher than costs in other nations.Also according to the December memo the U.S. has reintroduced a proposal that would hamper government health services from negotiating lower drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. The proposal appears to have been universally rejected earlier in the talks according to the memo.Australia and New Zealand have medical boards that allow the government to reject expensive new drugs for the public health system or negotiate lower prices with drug companies that own patents on them. If a new drug does not offer sufficient benefits over existing generic drugs the boards can reject spending taxpayer money on the new medicines. They can also refuse to pay high prices for new drugs. The Obama administration has been pushing to ban these activities by national boards which would lock in big profits for U.S. drug companies. Obamacare sought to mimic the behavior of these boards to lower domestic health care costs by granting new flexibilities to U.S. state agencies for determining drug prices.The U.S. is also facing major resistance on bank regulation standards. The Obama administration is seeking to curtail the use of ""capital controls"" by foreign governments. These can include an extremely broad variety of financial tools from restricting lending in overheated markets to denying mass international outflows of currency during a financial panic. The loss of these tools would dramatically limit the ability of governments to prevent and stem banking crises.""The positions are still paralyzed"" the December memo reads referring to the Financial Services Chapter. ""The United States shows zero flexibility.""Previously leaked TPP documents have sparked alarm among global health experts Internet freedom activists environmentalists and organized labor but are adamantly supported by American corporations and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The Obama administration has deemed negotiations to be classified information -- banning members of Congress from discussing the American negotiating position with the press or the public. Congressional staffers have been restricted from viewing the documents.This story has been updated with a comment from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and to specify that prescription drug flexibilities under Obamacare are provided to state boards.",1
301,"Elisabeth Rosenthal looks at the difference between the potential of renewables and the path we're on.We will need fossil fuels like oil and gas for the foreseeable future. So there’s really little choice (sigh). We have to press ahead with fracking for natural gas. We must approve the Keystone XL pipeline to get Canadian oil. This mantra repeated on TV ads and in political debates is punctuated with a tinge of inevitability and regret. But increasingly scientific research and the experience of other countries should prompt us to ask: To what extent will we really “need” fossil fuel in the years to come? To what extent is it a choice? ... “It’s absolutely not true that we need natural gas coal or oil — we think it’s a myth” said Mark Z. Jacobson a professor of civil and environmental engineering and the main author of the study published in the journal Energy Policy. “You could power America with renewables from a technical and economic standpoint. The biggest obstacles are social and political — what you need is the will to do it.”President Obama visits the Middle East makes history as he speaks war to Syria and Iran and peace to Israelis and Palestinians and the talk back home circles The Big Question: Will Hillary run?Not incidentally the women’s vote is hers. Even Republican women would find it hard not to cast a ballot for Hillary. If not her then who?Head Start education programs for low-income students are being slashed. So are medical services for 2 million native Americans living on Indian reservations and in Alaska. The Army is suspending tuition assistance for soldiers hoping to enroll in classes while scholarship funds have been curtailed for children of troops who were killed in combat. ... Still not everyone who depends on the federal government is suffering in these austere times. According to the Wall Street Journal the USDA is on the verge of purchasing 400000 tons of sugar in a massive bailout of domestic sugar processors. The move would cost taxpayers about $80 million.The major beneficiaries of this bailout would be cane growers in Florida and beet operations in Minnesota Michigan and North Dakota. Big Sugar has outsized political clout in Washington as evidenced by the silence of so-called fiscal conservatives. Heavy campaign contributions are spread among Democrats and Republicans alike. Barack Obama took money from the sugar industry as did Mitt Romney. Hefty donations went to both of Florida’s senators Bill Nelson and Marco Rubio. Every time somebody in Congress tries to kill the sugar subsidy the measure gets voted down — by some of the same lawmakers who love to rail against public spending on welfare benefits health care and education.Judging from the squeals we're hearing from members of Congress whose districts are threatened by cuts the effects are intolerable. The complaints from Democrats who never wanted the sequester to go into effect were predictable. But some of the complaining comes from Republicans who welcomed the sequester as an overdue act of belt-tightening. Tea Party Rep. Steve Stockman (R-Texas) has decried cuts to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration which he called ""one of the few legitimate functions of government."" (The Johnson Space Center with about 3000 civilian employees happens to be in his Houston-area district.) The sequester Stockman warned could put all Americans in danger — by hampering NASA's work to protect the Earth from asteroids.Kathleen Parker is apparently fixated on Hillary 2016 and thinks that you are too.Um maybe inhome Kathleen but the rest of America kind of cares about what the current president is doing. Still Parker does admit something that has to be tough for her to acknowledge. Carl Hiaasen looks at a portion of government that's miraculously dodged the budget cuts.Maybe they're just too sweet to fail. Or maybe... Doyle McManus says that the sequester is showing up in more than just programs that help kids and soldiers.But who really ""wins"" on the sequester is still an open question. Consider this your ""read it all"" political article of the morning.Paul Krugman examines another small instance of the Rand-ification of the right.On today’s right not only is civic virtue nay patriotism associated with narrow defense of your own self-interest any deviation from that standard — like being an affluent person who nonetheless supports aid to the poor paid for by progressive taxation — is considered prima facie hypocritical. … All through the 2012 campaign we were lectured about the evils of “attacking success“ which was defined as any criticism of how a wealthy individual got that way. But as soon as they think they spot an opening right-wingers go ahead and … attack success.A perfect storm has gathered over Colorado. The prevailing winds of value-free politics the decline of authentic debate and the increasing global warming of relativism will collide with the upslope of secularism and the denial of religious liberties to converge with individualistic notions of freedom absent responsibility producing powerful thunderstorms of hypocrisy and the rain of radical liberalism.Sarah Huntzinger deserves an award for her piece in the Denver Post. Maybe two awards. After all it's not every day you see someone combine a staggering persecution complex with writing worthy of Bulwer-Lytton.Admit it. You know you're going to read the rest of it just to see if she can keep up this level of indignent insanity. She can.

Study 1 surveyed rant-site visitors to better understand the perceived value of the Web sites and found that while they become relaxed immediately after posting they also experience more anger than most and express their anger in maladaptive ways. Study 2 explored the emotional impact of reading and writing rants and found that for most participants reading and writing rants were associated with negative shifts in mood.So in all things moderation.

302,President Obama who faithfully shops at independent bookstores when given the chance has angered the American Booksellers Assn. with a planned appearance Tuesday at an Amazon warehouse.The appearance is “greatly misguided” ABA Chief Executive Oren Teicher wrote in an open letter to the president. That’s because the online retailer has caused a net loss of jobs the organization argues while President Obama’s goal is to promote his plan for a stronger economy.Obama’s tour is called “A Better Bargain for the Middle Class.”Amazon has just announced that it will add 7000 jobs -- 2000 of those seasonal -- at its regional shipping and customer service centers. The company says its workers make 30% more than traditional retail staffers.AdvertisementAmazon news releases often make comparative references without sharing specific data. But it’s possible to get a sense of what it will pay its Chattanooga Tenn. warehouse workers: about $11 per hour according to the jobs website glassdoor.com.That’s a bit more than the $8.25 an hour McDonald’s pays its workers -- a wage that even McDonald’s acknowledges needs to be supplemented with a second job to make ends meet and those “ends” include rent of just $600 and no budget for heat -- but it’s hard to see how an annual salary of less than $23000 a year is a better bargain for the middle class.While it’s hard to get people to agree on exactly what a middle-class wage is in 2011 CNN Money reported that the first decade of the 21st century was the first time in American history that middle-class wages declined: Adjusted for inflation median household income dropped from $53164 to $49445.A 2012 Pew Research study showed that on average Americans think it takes $70000 for a family of four to be middle class.AdvertisementPublishers Weekly the publishing industry trade magazine quotes Obama deputy press secretary Amy Brundage on the appearance: “The Amazon facility in Chattanooga is a perfect example of the company that is investing in American workers and creating good high-wage jobs” she said Friday. “What the president wants to do is to highlight Amazon and the Chattanooga facility as an example of a company that is spurring job growth and keeping our country competitive.”ABA’s Teicher protests that writing “At a time when Main Street retailers including indie bookstores show promise of recovering from the recession we are disheartened to see Amazon touted as a ‘jobs creator’ and its warehouse facility used as a backdrop for an important jobs speech when frankly the exact opposite is true.”Citing the Institute for Local Self-Reliance Teicher writes “Every $10 million in spending that shifts from Main Street retailers to Amazon results in a net loss of 33 retail jobs. That would mean for 2012 alone — using Amazon’s own numbers about its increase in sales — Amazon cost the U.S. economy more than 42000 jobs just last year!”Can President Obama be a friend to independent booksellers and Amazon at the same time? He’s been photographed at independent bookstores Prairie Lights in Iowa City and Bunch of Grapes in Martha’s Vineyard. The next time he shows up to shop for books they may have some less-than-enthusiastic words for him.AdvertisementALSO:Remembering Mick FarrenNeil Gaiman wants you to help him create a video gameReza Aslan’s Jesus book a No. 1 bestseller thanks to Fox NewsAdvertisementCarolyn Kellogg: Join me on Twitter Facebook and Google+,1
303,With President Obama set to precipitate a constitutional crisis over the upcoming debt ceiling Republicans in Congress must now stand up to the bullying commander in chief.Yesterday after the fiscal cliff had been passed through Congress President Obama claimed victory. “Just recently” he told supporters “Republicans in Congress said they’d never agree to raise tax rates on the wealthiest Americans. We’ve now raised those rates permanently making our tax code more progressive than it’s been in decades.”But more important than Obama’s triumphalism was his insistence that he will not – repeat will not – negotiate over the debt ceiling. At all. “While I will negotiate over many things” Obama said “I will not have another debate with this Congress over whether or not they should pay the bills that they’ve already racked up through the laws that they passed.” Of course Obama has racked up those bills and it is he who refuses to pay the freight with any cuts whatsoever. But now he’s declaring the unilateral authority to avoid discussing the debt ceiling. “What the president was saying was ‘I’m not going to play chicken with the debt limit'” said Jen Psaki Obama’s spokeswoman.Under the Constitution of the United States the House of Representatives has the power of the purse strings. It is Congress that decides whether or not to incur more debt not the president. And yet Obama has essentially stated that he will not stand for any negotiation surrounding that Congressional power.That’s tyrannical. But unlike in the past the Democrats in Congress are willing to go along with such systemic perversion. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has shown himself quite willing to give Obama unlimited power to raise the debt ceiling.So the question now is whether Republicans will stand strong against this unconstitutional aggression from President Obama. In 2011 Republicans in Congress caved and ended up with the pathetic fiscal cliff proposal that set up massive tax increases and an across-the-board cut. Then they made that cave complete in order to avoid those default tax increases.Now however they have a second chance to stand tall. But they will have to stand together and they will have to hold Obama’s feet to the fire. The issue of the debt ceiling is about more than spending. It is about whether we have a Constitutional system worth preserving or whether the President should be allowed to run roughshod over it. Speaker of the House John Boehner has been re-elected — and in achieving re-election he has given himself a second bite at an apple he missed in 2011 during that disastrous debt ceiling debate. The time for compromise is finished. Our thug president ended it. Republicans must realize that and act accordingly.Ben Shapiro is Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News and author of the upcoming book “Bullies: How the Left’s Culture of Fear and Intimidation Silences America” (Threshold Editions January 8 2013).,1
304,Breitbart News has learned that Tea Party Patriots is asking its members to pressure Congress to conduct a full and thorough investigation into the IRS’s targeting of conservative and Tea Party organizations.The organization is calling on Congress to conduct “substantive” investigative hearings in the wake of recent reports that senior IRS officials knew in 2011 exactly what was going on despite initial claims that local “low-level” employees were the only ones involved in targeting conservatives.Tea Party Patriots co-founder Jenny Beth Martin said that on Friday “we learned that the IRS lied to Congress and the American citizens when Douglas Schulman said there was ‘absolutely no targeting’ of Tea Party groups who applied for nonprofit status.” Martin was referencing Schulman’s March 2012 Congressional testimony.Today we are learning that the IRS lied when they said that only “low-level employees” were to blame for outrageous and egregious overreach and abuse of power. The AP is reporting in June 2011 IRS division head Lois Lerner instructed employees to change the criteria for “flagging groups ‘immediately'” and in August 2011 “the IRS” Rulings and Agreements office “held a meeting with chief counsel so that everyone would have the latest information.”A Saturday report by the Associated Press citing a draft of a forthcoming Inspector General report found that “senior Internal Revenue Service officials knew agents were targeting Tea Party groups as early as 2011.” The AP notes that this report’s findings “seemingly contradicts public statements by the IRS commissioner.”On Friday the IRS admitted to targeting conservative and Tea Party groups and apologized for the behavior. But with this new information Martin said her organization “rejects the apology from the Internal Revenue Service.”“It appears the IRS committed crimes and violated our ability to exercise our First Amendment Right to Free Speech” Martin said. “A simple apology is not sufficient reparation for violating the Constitutional rights of United States citizens.”In the release Martin said Tea Party Patriots is “encouraged to hear that Congress plans to investigate. Those responsible must be held accountable and must resign or be terminated for their actions.”Martin also asked conservative grassroots activists “around the country to help us with two things.”First she asked activists to help make sure “that the hearings in Congress are substantive and get to the bottom of this scandal to reveal how deep it runs how many other lies the IRS has told related to the these tactics and what will be done to insure no other group of citizens is so unfairly discriminated against solely because they are speaking out against rampant government.” She called on members to “call your Member of Congress and both of your Senators to let them know that we must get to the bottom of this scandal.”Second she said Tea Party Patriots needs to “hear from you if you or your local group has felt intimidated by the IRS actions over the last 4 years.”Are you part of a local group who applied for tax-exempt status? What is the status of that application? Did you set out to form a group but were so intimidated by the IRS tactics that you abandoned that goal and wound up participating only as individuals rather than incorporating and coordinating activity with other groups?Martin provided a website for conservatives to use to submit any stories of abuse available here.,1
305,According to a 2011 financial document Mr. Froman held $490845 in a fund managed by Citigroup and based in Grand Cayman’s Ugland House a modest whitewashed building that has been widely cited as a symbol of tax avoidance since it is home to nearly 19000 business entities seeking favorable tax treatment.In answers to Finance Committee questions Mr. Froman said on May 17 that he still held those assets but would sell them off within 90 days of confirmation as trade representative.Mr. Grassley said the president once called the Ugland House “the biggest tax scam in the world.”“Yet he nominated two top advisers in a row who invested in the Ugland House” Mr. Grassley said. “He also nominated a commerce secretary with significant offshore income.”Mr. Froman’s 2009 financial disclosure forms showed holdings in three different Citigroup accounts that maximize profits through “carried interest” a tax loophole that allows private equity and hedge fund managers to claim compensation as capital gains thus paying a lower tax rate than if that pay is taxed as income.Mr. Froman received a $2 million payout from Citigroup to waive his holdings in the India Infrastructure Carried Interest Plan and from another investment called the Sustainable Investments Carry LP. Another account Citi Infrastructure Investors Carried LP showed $1 million to $5 million in assets in 2009. Those assets were transferred to his wife Nancy Goodman who has promised to divest them as soon as he is confirmed. But White House officials say their value in his latest financial disclosure was revised to zero because of fund performance.As the financial industry went into a tailspin Mr. Froman received a bonus in 2008 of $2.75 million based on his performance the year before. In 2009 his bonus for 2008 work was $2.25 million. The justification for these bonuses given to the committee was “normal industry practice.”,1
306,"Story highlights House Speaker John Boehner says he won't negotiate legislation with the president Zelizer: House GOP won't acknowledge Obama's mandate Boehner not in control of caucus Navarrette: Obama needs to stop practicing ""defiance politics"" needs to lead Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell could be instrumental in upcoming battles(CNN) —If all the recent wrangling over the fiscal cliff has revealed anything it’s how tense and strained President Obama’s relationship is with Republicans in Congress.Borger: Fiscal cliff was bound to collapseAnd Obama’s relationship with Congress reached yet another low Thursday when House Speaker John Boehner confirmed to CNN that he has told House Republicans he will no longer negotiate legislative deals with the president.And in an opinion piece on Thursday Sen. John Cornyn of Texas faulted the president for all the fiscal brinksmanship since 2010. The new No. 2 Senate Republican also suggested that “[i]t may be necessary to partially shut down the government in order to secure the long-term fiscal well being of our country.”Low bar for new CongressIn the White House’s relationship with Capitol Hill “the real negative is clearly that the relationship with House Republicans is as bad as ever” CNN contributor and Princeton University historian Julian Zelizer said adding that the House GOP refuses to acknowledge any mandate from Obama after November’s election.“They are going to fight the president tooth and nail” Zelizer said a problem made worse by the fact that Boehner “is not in control” of House Republicans particularly the contingent of fiscal conservatives brought to Washington by support from the tea party movement.Zelizer: GOP faces choice – leadership or gridlock?CNN contributor Ruben Navarrette Jr. said Obama’s strained relationship with congressional Republicans dates back to the contentious debate over Obama’s signature health care legislation where the president showed his willingness to push through major proposals and major legislation without consulting them.“He is so good at the business of politics that he’s really outmaneuvered them” Navarrette observed about Obama’s relationship with Republicans over the past four years.Navarrette: The real issue is runaway spendingThe already difficult relationship isn’t helped by unique issues on each side.The GOP has been struggling to define itself and its message in tough economic times amidst twin concerns about government spending and income inequality.Zelizer: What the tea party cost the GOPAnd buoyed by his electoral success in 2008 legislative successes in the first half of his first term and by winning a second term Obama adopted a take-it-or-leave-it attitude with Republicans even as the nation teetered on the edge of the fiscal cliff.“My preference would have been to solve these problems in the context of a larger agreement a bigger deal a grand bargain. But with this Congress that was obviously a little too much to hope for at this time” Obama said Monday afternoon at a White House event that at moments seemed like a campaign gathering.At the same event Obama also warned the GOP about expected battles over spending cuts in the coming months.“Now if Republicans think that I will finish the job of deficit reduction through spending cuts alone” Obama said “[I]f they think that’s going to be the formula for how we solve this thing then they’ve got another thing coming. That’s not how it’s going to work.” Rather Obama declared “it’s going to have to be a matter of shared sacrifice at least as long as I’m president. And I’m going to be president for the next four years.”Obama’s recent post-election trash talking directed at Congress is “defiance politics” that misunderstands what it means to win an election Navarrette said.The president’s recent comments are like “an end zone dance a celebration” or in the world of mixed martial arts competition like “putting your foot on the other guy’s neck and holding your hand up in the air” after you’ve felled your opponent according to Navarrette.Instead of taking every opportunity to remind Republicans that he won (and they lost) last November Obama needs to realize that “with winning elections comes the responsibility to lead” Navarrette said. As the person in whom the public has placed its trust and confidence “your burdens are much greater (than your losing opponent’s).”Democrats counter that Obama hasn’t had anyone to make a deal with.“When John Boehner comes to the table and he can’t even bring his deputy or his third in command to vote for the deal that he is agreeing to I think you’ve got a real crisis of leadership in the House” former White House press secretary Bill Burton said.Debt Ceiling: Welcome to Fight Club“And so the president showed that even in that case he can get a deal that moves the ball forward for the country but going forward you just wonder how much control does Boehner have over the folks in the House and what kind of deals are we going to be able to get?”For all his recent public swagger when it comes to Congress Obama “really does compromise a lot” said Zelizer. For example Zelizer pointed out that during recent negotiations over the fiscal cliff the president changed his position substantially on the income threshold for eliminating the Bush tax cuts.While he says he doesn’t think there’s much more Obama can do publicly to smooth over the differences with House Republicans Zelizer said that Obama can’t let stand Boehner’s declaration that he’s abandoning any more legislative deal-making with the White House. The president would be wise to try to work behind the scenes to keep Boehner “in the fold and maintain some sort of relationship” with the speaker.And Zelizer noted an encouraging pattern in the recent fiscal brinksmanship between Congress and the president.After negotiations between Boehner and Obama broke down “(Senate Minority Leader Mitch) McConnell stepped up and put the deal together” observed Zelizer who added the Senate could take the lead again in working out agreements on things like handling automatic spending cuts put off by this week’s fiscal cliff deal and likely upcoming battles over the debt ceiling and funding the federal government.Zelizer noted that after McConnell negotiated a deal with Vice President Joe Biden Boehner allowed House Republicans to entertain an alternative that would have included more spending cuts an alternative which never made it to a vote because fiscal conservatives couldn’t muster a majority in the House GOP to support its passage.Ultimately Boehner kept his pledge to Democratic leaders in Congress to put the Senate’s deal up for a House vote. By making the pledge before the terms of the Senate deal were even set Zelizer said Boehner sent a signal to House Republicans that they were going to lose the battle over the fiscal cliff even if they didn’t like the Senate deal.The maneuvers by McConnell and Boehner suggest a path forward if repeated according to Zelizer because if GOP leaders continue not to obstruct Democrats as they try to move forward with legislation that could help bring around tea party Republicans in the House.Tea party calls for consequences after fiscal cliff voteIn order to improve their relationship with the White House Navarette said Republicans “have to fix what’s broken in their own party they have to heal the divisions in their own party … and define what the GOP is about.”Boehner re-elected speaker in midst of public defectionsCalling it “a miracle” that Boehner was re-elected as speaker Navarette said the GOP must also decide which role it wants to play in Obama’s second term. Will they try to be accommodating and try to work with the president to find solutions to problems including some problems Republican donors and the Republican establishment wants fixed? Or will they play the proverbial loyal opposition?Both are “not terribly attractive options” for the GOP Navarette said especially up against a masterful political strategist like Obama.And Navarrette suggests that the sports-loving and competitive Obama invite top Republicans over to the White House for his annual Super Bowl watching party in order to build personal relationships across the aisle in Congress.For Obama moderating his triumphal defiant approach when it comes to Republicans and Congress is also important because Navarette points out gun control and immigration reform are both high on Obama’s second term agenda. And there are strong feelings on the part of conservatives and Obama’s liberal base on both issues.Politics in 2013: 5 things to watch forObama talks about ‘worst day of my presidency’ goals for next termOn the fiscal issues where Obama has repeatedly clashed with Capitol Hill Republicans in the past two years Zelizer warns that recent events could repeat themselves.“It’s going to be rough going to be tough we’re going to see this issue recur again and again over the years” the historian said.Indeed both Obama and McConnell the GOP’s new lead fiscal negotiator already seem to be playing out a familiar script.3 more fiscal cliffs loomThe last fiscal battle barely over Obama wasted no time late Tuesday night staking out his position in the battles to come.After saying “I am very open to compromise” the president went on to fire a shot over Congress’ bow in the likely fight in February over raising the debt ceiling. “[W]hile I will negotiate over many things I will not have another debate with this Congress over whether or not they should pay the bills that they’ve already racked up through the laws that they passed” Obama declared “Let me repeat: We can’t not pay bills that we’ve already incurred.”McConnell quickly fired back.“The president may not want to have a fight about government spending over the next few months but it’s the fight he is going to have because it’s a debate the country needs” McConnell wrote in a Yahoo op-ed published Wednesday night adding that Obama “must show up” and deliver a serious plan for slashing federal spending.“That’s the debate the American people really want. It’s a debate Republicans are ready to have. And it’s the debate that starts today whether the president wants it or not” McConnell wrote.Although he has sworn off direct negotiations with Obama Boehner echoed McConnell’s remarks on Friday.“With the cliff behind us the focus turns to spending” Boehner told House Republicans.CNN’s Jim Acosta Jessica Yellin Dana Bash Deidre Walsh Ted Barrett Paul Steinhauser Gabriella Schwarz Halimah Abdullah Ben Brumfield Steve Almasy and CNNMoney’s Rich Barbieri contributed to this report.",1
307,Joy Reid at The Grio reports that the Heritage Foundation the uber-rightwing think tank that Jim DeMint left the Senate to head up just sent this letter to Speaker Boehner and Eric Cantor:For the first time the activities of the Obama administration are receiving a sustained public vetting. Americans’ outrage over Benghazi is amplified by the Internal Revenue Service’s intimidation of conservative grassroots organizations and a cascade of negative headlines. There is the real sense the Obama administration has been less than forthright with the American people the press and lawmakers.Recent events have rightly focused the nation’s attention squarely on the actions of the Obama administration. It is incumbent upon the House of Representatives to conduct oversight hearings on those actions but it would be imprudent to do anything that shifts the focus from the Obama administration to the ideological differences within the House Republican Conference.To that end we urge you to avoid bringing any legislation to the House Floor that could expose or highlight major schisms within the conference. Legislation such as the Internet sales tax or the FARRM Act which contains nearly $800 billion in food stamp spending would give the press a reason to shift their attention away from the failures of the Obama administration to write another “circular firing squad” article.Make no mistake principled conservatives will still oppose bad policy if it comes to the floor. Rather than scheduling such legislation for consideration we urge you to keep the attention focused squarely on the Obama administration. As the public’s trust in their government continues to erode it is incumbent upon those of us who support a smaller less intrusive government to lead.SincerelyMichael A.

310,"(Boy do I love being able to type those words - ""Sen.

Warren's (sort of rhetorical) questions who were not able to say when they had taken any banker to trial.But the true sign that her line of questioning struck a nerve with bankers accustomed to the comfy status quo was in the immediate terrified howling pushback by numerous banking executives - who refuse to come out into the open and identify themselves rather remain anonymous.Elizabeth Warren asked why banks traded below book value while most corporations trade above book value. She proposed some possible explanations:""One would be because nobody believes that the banks' books are honest"" she said. ""Second would be that nobody believes that the banks are really manageable. That is if they are too complex either for their own institutions to manage them or for the regulators to manage them.""She also earned significant ire from bankers with her line that one reason big banks mostly trade below book value may be that “nobody believes” their books are honest. Most of the complaints came on background or off the record given that these bankers have to deal with Warren in the Senate for at least six years and perhaps much longer and are (apparently quite justifiably) freaked out at the prospect.Predictably the banksters did not take kindly to having the curtain pulled back:",1
311,"1) Liberal groups will launch a national TV ad campaign that hits Republicans for letting benefits expire for over one million Americans to be launched the day after Christmas and run on national cable through at least December 28th the day benefits are set to expire. The ads will also highlight GOP priorities by spotlighting GOP opposition to nixing loopholes enjoyed by the top one percent even as a lifeline expires for over one million far less fortunate Americans. There may also be a second round of ads launched when Congress returns in early January. The ads — backed by a “significant” buy a source says — will be run by Americans United for Change. Other groups involved in the broader campaign include the National Employment Law project AFSCME the AFL-CIO SEIU and UAW. 2) House Democrats are planning a big push in local media with the goal of using local coverage to dramatize how constituents in Republican districts will be impacted by the expiration of benefits. This is hyper-granular stuff: I’m told Ways and Means Committee Dems are collecting county-by-county data on the number of people who will be kicked off benefits and pushing local press outlets to reflect these numbers in their coverage.The idea is to make it harder for individual lawmakers to escape the direct consequences in their districts of failing to renew benefits bringing it home ... 3) Liberal groups are drawing up lists of House Republicans who are both vulnerable and reside in states where unemployment is high. The targeting of them will take various forms such as conference calls — directed at local media in their states and districts — that feature people who are losing benefits. Meanwhile labor unions are planning events in states and liberal groups are planning polls on unemployment benefits in both marginal districts and nationally. Results should be released next week.Sargent notes that the ultimate objective of this campaign is to convince voters despite the media's automatic inclination to blame ""Congress"" for any gridlock or federal inaction that the blame for failing to pass an extension of this popular program and hurting 1.3 million Americans in the process falls squarely on the Republican Party. And just as with the contrast between Democrats and Republicans on maintaining current levels of food assistance programs for the neediest there is certainly room to gain political ground from the electorate by campaigning on conservative heartlessness toward the poor—especially when said conservatives insist on having poor kids sweep school floors to earn their lunches while their wealthier counterparts stand idly by.Without question maintaining food stamps and unemployment benefits is an unqualified good. But there is room for debate on whether focusing on the safety net nearly exclusively is harming the liberal project at large. At the New York Times Thomas Edsall cribs substantially from a post by Roosevelt Institute Fellow Mike Konczal to argue that doubling down on the ""social safety net"" strategy actually detracts from the progressive agenda at large:In practice Konczal writes the political left has abandoned its quest for deep structural reform — full employment and worker empowerment — and instead has “doubled-down” on the safety net strategy. The result in his view is “a kind of pity-charity liberal capitalism.” Konczal’s poignant description of the problem goes a long way toward explaining the current struggles of the left. The question is whether there is an effective worker empowerment strategy at a time of globalization offshoring and robotization. Insofar as Democrats concentrate the bulk of their efforts on means-tested transfer programs (on the extension of long-term unemployment benefits Medicaid and food stamps for example) they leave the most needy and vulnerable to the vagaries of public opinion. Survey data find that during hard times people become less altruistic and more inclined to see the poor as undeserving. They turn to the right not the left in periods of economic stress.Edsall makes the case that business interests are more than happy to have the social safety net in place because the welfare state allows them to pay wages that would otherwise be completely inadequate while expecting government to pick up the tab and ensure that these workers have enough resources to prevent the fabric of society from fraying completely. Meanwhile the current political debate is occurring between Democratic elites who support ""pity-charity liberalism"" despite the lack of a broader empowerment agenda and a Republican Party infected with such a case of Social Darwinism that it seems to want to see the poor starve seemingly out of spite if nothing else.Edsall concludes:The call of Konczal and his colleagues on the progressive left for an empowerment agenda — for structural economic reform — faces roadblocks far higher than many people realize. The loss of a political movement (economic liberalism) and its political vehicle (a stable progressive coalition) has put the left into a position of retreat struggling to protect besieged programs that are designed explicitly for the poor and that therefore lack strong public backing. The shift of the Democratic Party from economic to “pity-charity” liberalism has put the entire liberal project in danger. It has increased its vulnerability to conservative challenge and left it without a base of politically mobilized supporters. Progressives are now dependent on the fragile possibility that inequality and socioeconomic immobility will push the social order to the breaking point and force the political system to respond.Now none of this is to argue that Democrats and progressive allies should not continue to fight tooth and nail for extensions of the social safety net. Obviously common decency economic justice and the maintenance of the social fabric depend on the continuance of these programs. But especially now that Republicans have been using their control of the House of Representatives to chip away at the social safety net at every opportunity playing defense is not enough. It is critical to go on offense and fight for a broader empowerment agenda and fundamental structural economic reform rather than continue to simply defend the social safety net while austerity and economic inequality force ever-increasing numbers of people to rely on it.Edsall is correct that the political power of the bottom half of the economic spectrum has been gutted and hollowed out; that we have lost a political movement and a political vehicle at the nationwide level. At the local level however there are signs of coalescence as minimum wage increases take hold across the country and as fast food strikes spring up organically across the country. And in Senator Elizabeth Warren we have one nationwide leader who is willing to not just defend the social safety net but put fundamental economic reform at the top of her agenda.The progressive movement is starting to see the energy and leadership necessary to stop simply playing defense and start advocating for an empowerment agenda that can reverse the decades of squeezing and fracturing endured by the middle class. The question is whether we can sustain enough organizational strength to capitalize at both the local and the federal level and bring about the type of fundamental economic change we need.",1
312,"WASHINGTON -- On election night in Chicago two months ago President Barack Obama triumphantly pledged to fight for a middle class he'd appealed to relentlessly -- and successfully -- on the 2012 campaign trail.""I believe we can build on the progress we've made and continue to fight for new jobs and new opportunity and new security for the middle class"" Obama said. ""I believe we can keep the promise of our founders the idea that if you're willing to work hard ... you can make it here in America.""The central challenge of Obama's second term is whether he can keep that founder’s ""promise"" to working Americans. It won't be easy and in an era of divided government and amid cries for austerity and budget cuts it does not seem likely that the president will offer sweeping new proposals to do so. The administration has said that its top two priorities at the outset of its second term are immigration reform and gun control. Despite an ongoing jobs crisis creating quality jobs seems to have fallen a few slots on the president's to-do list.As Obama implicitly acknowledged the American middle class has fallen on hard times saddled with historic levels of debt skyrocketing health care costs and flat wages. By most accounts middle-class Americans are no better off than they were when the president took office in 2009 in the wake of an unprecedented financial crisis and in the midst of the Great Recession.The arithmetic is stark. Median household income is lower than when Obama took office according to Census Bureau data -- lower even than when President Bill Clinton left office in 2001. The middle 60 percent of households -- those earning between $20262 and $101582 -- captured a smaller share of aggregate income in 2011 than they did in 2009 while the top fifth which already made more than the other groups combined captured more. Surveys of public opinion reveal a middle class that is smaller poorer and less optimistic than ever. And although the unemployment rate fitfully has fallen below 8 percent for the first time since Obama's 2009 inauguration most new jobs are too low-paying to sustain middle-class families.There is more to the plight of the American middle class than numbers can express -- and a greater threat to the country than economists can quantify.Democracy after all can't thrive without a broad strong educated core of citizens. But today they find themselves buffeted by the remorseless dictates of global capital the need for evermore education and training and the burdens of higher taxes to pay for social programs they need such as health care.Battling these global and cultural trends is difficult. In fact it is unfair to ask any one person -- even a president even Barack Obama -- to overcome them all. The president’s first responsibility in 2009 literally was to do his part to save the world’s frozen capital banking and trade systems -- without which the American middle class would have had no prospects at all.Most fair-minded observers would say that Obama did his part and acquitted himself well under crushing circumstances. A workable and affordable health care system the central legislative success of his first term can (if he sets it up properly) be of great benefit to middle-class workers.But now he must make good on his own promise -- not always central to his discourse or decision making -- to find more good-paying middle class jobs.How?On the stump this year the president made manufacturing a centerpiece of his vision arguing that a combination of tax reform investment and education could help repatriate quality jobs to U.S. soil and stabilize the middle class. Perhaps sensing the political popularity of such an idea in Rust Belt states like Ohio and Michigan the Obama campaign set the lofty but achievable goal of creating a million new manufacturing jobs during the president's second term.In a recent interview on ""Meet the Press"" the president renewed his commitment to investing in infrastructure which he called ""broken"" as another way to create good-paying jobs.With the conversation in Washington focused not just on austerity but how much austerity to apply to a sputtering economy it's hard to imagine what kind of rebooted jobs plan the president could propose for his next term while staying within the bounds of political reality.""In the short term we are in a pretty difficult spot"" said John Schmitt an economist with the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research who studies economic inequality and unemployment. ""Even if there was a serious commitment on the part of the administration towards a jobs program of some sort it would run into a lot of trouble in the Congress.""Without a clear and politically viable policy objective for jobs -- unlike say banning high-capacity magazines to address mass shootings -- the administration is likely to continue the piecemeal approach to economic recovery that it took for most of the president's first term observers say.Obama's landmark 2009 stimulus bill pumped billions of dollars into the ailing economy stemming the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs each month. The bill addressed the short-term fallout in the private sector by cutting taxes and pouring money into infrastructure projects and expanded unemployment insurance benefits.But since then additional spending has been all but off the table. Obama has repeatedly proposed more infrastructure spending but the White House has routinely given up such demands in negotiations with congressional Republicans.The lack of stimulus since the initial package -- aside from the repeated extensions of long-term unemployment insurance -- has exasperated left-leaning and centrist economists.""The answer is very clear: We need substantial additional stimulus to support the economy"" said Heidi Shierholz an economist at the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) a left-of-center think tank. ""We are choosing as a country and as a town [Washington] not to do it with millions of jobless workers.""To address the decline in manufacturing jobs the Obama administration has undertaken a number of modest initiatives such as launching a manufacturing institute in Youngstown Ohio with $30 million in federal funding a joint effort between industry and schools to train workers for tomorrow's manufacturing jobs. The Youngstown facility focuses on training workers for 3-D printing technology the kind of modern manufacturing industry where observers see a lot of potential.The facility is an acknowledgment that tomorrow's manufacturing jobs will be different from the ones of the past. Gone are the days when a new high school graduate could show up at the factory door get trained on the shop floor and earn a good wage and a pension. Jobs like those in 3-D printing require more advanced training and a certain degree of computer literacy. The same goes for other areas where experts as well as the White House see promise like industrial robotics or nanomanufacturing. Obama's own tech advisers have warned that the country's ""historic leadership"" in manufacturing technology is ""at risk"" if it can't cultivate the right talent for these fields.In his 2013 budget proposal Obama called for devoting $1 billion to create a national network of institutes like the one in Youngstown -- a recommendation that hasn't exactly become a priority for Congress. Neither have the loftier goals of his earlier manufacturing package such as extending tax breaks to companies that return jobs to U.S. shores. They appear unlikely to move forward in a second term even if the president chooses to champion them.""The administration has done some things but could do a lot more to help manufacturing"" said Scott Paul director of the non-profit Alliance for American Manufacturing. What the White House has done so far is ""not well-publicized or well-known. They will ultimately be helpful but so much of the debate has become politicized it's hard to make progress on some of the meaningful issues.""And in the end the manufacturing plan still faces some cold mathematics. The U.S. lost more than 5 million manufacturing jobs in the first decade of this century falling from 17 million to 12 million. Fewer than 9 percent of American workers have manufacturing jobs compared with more than 20 percent in 1979. Creating a million new such jobs puts only a dent in that sector's -- and the middle class's -- long-term woes.""It doesn't come close to restoring manufacturing employment to what it had been"" Paul noted adding that he still found the goal admirable.Even setting aside the immediate joblessness crisis Obama still faces the long-term problems of deteriorating wages and growing income inequality for the poor and middle class. Since 1979 the top 1 percent of American households captured more than 38 percent of income growth while the bottom 90 percent received just shy of 37 percent according to EPI.The Great Recession technically ended halfway through 2009 but the economic recovery of the past few years is replacing office workers real estate brokers and insurance claims adjusters with retail salespeople restaurant workers and warehouse hands.Mid-wage jobs -- ones with median hourly wages ranging from $13.84 to $21.13 -- accounted for 60 percent of the jobs lost during the recession according to an analysis by the National Employment Law Project a worker advocacy group. During the recovery since then mid-wage jobs have represented just 22 percent of growth. Jobs earning less than $13.84 per hour made up 58 percent of recovery growth according to the NELP.The president pledged during his 2008 campaign that by 2011 he would have the minimum wage raised to $9.50 and pegged to inflation a move that worker advocates have clamored for for years claiming it would help raise the wage floor for the working poor and the middle class. But the federal minimum wage remains $7.25 per hour well below a living wage in most areas.Many of those same worker advocates tie the stagnation of real wages to the decline of collective bargaining in the workplace. The rate of unionization in the U.S. has fallen to a historic low with just 7 percent of private-sector workers now belonging to a union. Labor leaders believe that labor law needs to be amended to make it easier for workers to join unions. Their best shot came and went under the president's watch when Democrats failed to pass the Employee Free Choice Act when they controlled both chambers of Congress.""I do feel disappointment"" said Schmitt the Center for Economic and Policy Research economist. ""That said we're also in a [political] context where it's extremely difficult to make any progress on the concerns of low- and middle-wage workers.""Despite those shortcomings and despite the acrimony on Capitol Hill liberals like Richard Trumka president of the AFL-CIO federation of unions are bullish on Obama's second term given the focus on the middle class and jobs during the election.""It all starts with the political will or the national appetite to again create jobs that are going to be family-supportive and middle-class producing and I think that's underway right now"" Trumka said. ""People are talking about it. That's the difference between this election and the ones in the past. We actually had a debate about what's hollowing out the country and what isn't. And our side won big time.""Now the president’s challenge is to turn that political victory into an economic one for the people who supported him.This article is part of a series produced by The Huffington Post that closely examines the most pressing challenges facing President Obama in his second term.

313,"Republican state legislators in Kansas are calling on the University of Kansas to dismiss a tenured journalism professor over a controversial tweet in which the professor suggested that children of National Rifle Association members should be the victims in a mass shooting.David Guth a tenured associate professor of journalism tweeted Monday: ""The blood is on the hands of the #NRA. Next time let it be YOUR sons and daughters. Shame on you. May God damn you."" The words came following the Navy Yard shooting in Washington.Guth was put on paid administrative leave Friday and the university has taken steps to distance itself from the tweet. In a statement reported by Fox4 in Kansas the school's vice chancellor called the tweet ""repugnant"" while Ann Brill Kansas' journalism dean said the university does not agree with Guth and does not ""advocate violence directed against any group or individuals.""#NavyYardShooting The blood is on the hands of the #NRA. Next time let it be YOUR sons and daughters. Shame on you. May God damn you. — David Guth (@DWGuth) September 16 2013While the university has taken steps against Guth Republican state lawmakers want Guth fired. If he isn't they say the school could face consequences. State Senate President Susan Wagle (R-Wichita) and Senate Majority Leader Terry Bruce (R-Hutchison) have both issued statements calling for Guth's dismissal. State Sen. Greg Smith (R-Overland Park) released a statement Friday saying that unless further action is taken against Guth he will react.""As a public educator in the Kansas high school education system I am often consulted by my students as to which college they should attend"" Smith said in his statement. ""As long as Professor Guth remains employed by the University of Kansas I will no longer recommend the university as an institution worthy of attendance by any of my students nor as a state senator will I support any budget proposals or recommendations for the University of Kansas.""Other Republican lawmakers echoed Smith's comments about the university budget. State Rep. Travis Couture-Lovelady (R-Palco) told The Huffington Post that the university's latest budget proposal is arriving this week on lawmakers' desks -- and it asks for an increase. Swift action against Guth is needed to show that the university does not tolerate his tweet Couture-Lovelady said.""It is a university decision"" Couture-Lovelady said. ""We are elected representatives of the people who develop the budget for the university. I could see something like this being detrimental to their cause. Things like this hurt their cause and it's unfortunate. I want to see them continue to grow.""State Rep. Brett Hildabrand (R-Shawnee) one of the most vocal pro-Second Amendment legislators in Kansas told HuffPost that he and other lawmakers have been in contact with the university to express their opinions that Guth should be fired.""He went after the children of NRA members and some of those children could be students in one of his classes"" Hildabrand said. ""That sets up a hostile environment for the students.""Guth has been standing by his comments telling Fox4KC Thursday that he does not want people to be shot.""If you look at how I structured the statement I didn’t really bring [the NRA’s) children into it” he said according to Fox4KC. “I carefully structured the statement to make it conditional but apparently it was too much of a nuance for some people.”“I don’t want anybody harmed. If somebody’s going to be harmed maybe it ought to be the people who believe that guns are so precious that it’s worth spilling blood over” Guth added according to Fox4KC. Guth did not immediately respond to a request for comment from HuffPost.Several lawmakers expressed concern that Guth's administrative leave is paid. Rep. Reid Petty (R-Liberal) said that while he doesn't think administrative leave is enough of a sanction for Guth it's not the job of the legislature to interject itself into Guth's employment status.""I don't think that it is appropriate for us"" Petty said. ""We can share our opinions and you have the chancellor and the Board of Regents. If you had a pattern of professors saying outrageous things then we could.""Jack Martin University of Kansas spokesman said the university did not have a comment on the legislators. He referred back to the statement the school released announcing Guth's suspension.All of the legislators contacted by HuffPost said they agree that Guth has a First Amendment right to free speech. But they said he's paid by the taxpayer and has embarrassed the state.""He has freedom of speech. Speak all he wants as a former KU professor"" state Rep. J.R. Claeys (R-Salina) told HuffPost. ""When he voices an insensitive and threatening opinion he doesn't get to take the good image of our institutions down with him.""UPDATE: 10:30 p.m. -- Guth told The Huffington Post in an email he agreed with University of Kansas officials' request to take paid administrative leave because of the threats. He explained:""I have had conversations with the university and have agreed to this action -- an administrative leave with pay -- in light of the abusive email threats I and others have received. It is in it the best interests and peace of mind of our students that I remove myself from the situation and let cooler heads prevail. It is unfortunate that my comments have been deliberately distorted. I know what I meant. Unfortunately this is a topic that generates more heat than light. I don't think any further comment would be appropriate at this time.""",1
314,I have seen more powerful men than Barack Obama fall. I worked in South Africa during Thabo Mbeki’s presidency when the ruling African National Congress (ANC) won 70% of the vote and earned the power to change his country’s constitution unilaterally. In 2005 I watched from the gallery as he told Parliament he was dismissing his deputy Jacob Zuma over allegations of corruption stemming from a lucrative arms deal.Two years later Mbeki was ousted by his party and forced to resign his presidency of the country. Zuma is now president and the ruling party is both fractured by rivalries and weakened by the growing strength of the opposition Democratic Alliance. The growing current of dissent in South Africa is not primarily over principles or policies but over clashes over the spoils of power in a time of economic stagnation and turmoil.President Obama holds unprecedented sway over his own party–and yet the first signs of internal tension are already bursting into the open. The news that he has turned his campaign into a permanent non-profit organizing outfit to push for his policies has been greeted with frustration by members of the Democratic National Committee who see the new “Organizing for Action” group as a competitor for fundraising dollars and power.The Hill reports on the open dissatisfaction at the DNC:DNC members said they were caught off guard when the leaders of the president’s reelection team announced Obama for America was morphing into Organizing for Action (OFA) a nonprofit group that can take unlimited “soft money” donations….While the new group will seek to go toe to toe with GOP outside groups like Crossroads GPS some Democrats aren’t pleased that Obama didn’t fold his powerful grassroots operation back into the DNC.The looming fights over spending deficits and debts also threatens the coalition that re-elected President Obama. The Obama administration designed a sequester whose non-defense cuts would scare as many voters and interest groups as possible. It expected that sequester to be canceled; now there is a strong chance that it may go through. If it does interest groups and lobbies may find themselves fighting each other–and Obama.Many of the president’s strongest backers were prepared to wait until the election was over to demand their money’s worth. Hollywood for example watched the defeat of the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) in frustration–and patiently waited for Obama to return to office. Now having won its tax benefits in the fiscal cliff talks it may revive SOPA again.Yet it will have to compete with other interest groups in the Democrats’ coalition who believe that the president was not aggressive enough in his first term and are no longer willing to accept the idea that compromise with Republicans is necessary. The rush to redeem promises made by Obama to each of these constituencies will likely increase friction within Democratic ranks–just as Republicans are pressing their case on debt.That is why the most important opposition to Obama may come from within–some on matters of principle such as the loose alliance of liberal and pro-Israel groups opposing Chuck Hagel’s nomination for Secretary of Defense; and others on pure self-interest. Republican opposition will still be critical especially given the effective veto the House still holds. But it will likely be given a boost by Democrats’ own greed and impatience.,1
315,"Well that was quick: Hillary Clinton is no longer inevitable.The media giveth and the media taketh away. And so the consensus that she will be sworn in as president in January 2017 has begun to crumble.All right I’m exaggerating a bit. More than two years before the Iowa caucuses normal people haven’t even tuned in. And many in the press undoubtedly believe that Clinton will be facing off against Chris Christie who as expected won a huge reelection victory yesterday. (For junkies: a network exit poll had her beating Christie in New Jersey 49 to 43 percent.)I’ve always had problems with the whole Hillary inevitability scenario having seen that evaporate in 2008. But the conventional wisdom in the press seemed set in cement notwithstanding the fact that Clinton hasn’t said she’s running.Now comes liberal New York Times columnist Frank Bruni to say that gadzooks she’s slipping in the polls. An NBC/Wall Street Journal survey found that Clinton’s favorability rating had slipped from 56 to 46 percent while her unfavorable rose from 29 to 33 percent. Stop the presses!“Here we go. The beginning of the end of her inevitability...“Voters are souring on familiar political operators especially those in or associated with Washington. That’s why Clinton has fallen. She’s lumped together with President Obama with congressional leaders with the whole reviled lot of them.”That’s an excellent and underappreciated point.“And some of the ways in which she stands out from the lot aren’t flattering. She comes with a more tangled political history of gifts bestowed favors owed ironclad allegiances and ancient feuds than almost any possible competitor does…“And what would the argument for a Hillary presidency be? Something interesting happens when you ask Democrats why her in 2016. They say that it’s time for a woman that she’ll raise oodles of dough that other potentially strong candidates won’t dare take her on. The answers are about the process more than the person or any vision she has for the country. There’s no poetry in them. That’s not good.”I wouldn’t dispute for a second that Hillary Clinton is the overwhelming Democratic front-runner even if there’s a challenge from the left and that the groundbreaking nature of her candidacy will be a major asset. But I’ve always felt the media bestowed the inevitability crown too quickly and here’s why.No one knows what the political climate will be in 2016 but I know this: After eight years of one party controlling the White House voters are usually ready for a change. Only once since the advent of presidential term limits—when George H.W. Bush defeated the hapless Mike Dukakis to succeed Ronald Reagan—has the country given one party 12 straight years.If the Obama administration is limping out of office at relatively low popularity that will affect the woman who was the president’s secretary of State. If ObamaCare is judged by then to have been a disaster that will affect the woman who first pushed universal health care when her husband was president.And since Hillary has been a national figure since 1992 and Bill is such a force in the Democratic Party it’s a bit harder for her to run as a fresh face if Washington seems like a mess.She could overcome all of that of course with an inspiring campaign. But it’s a tad early to say that in November of 2013.Meanwhile Carla Marinucci of the San Francisco Chronicle is razzing her approach to the lecture circuit:“Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton hasn’t even started her 2016 presidential campaign yet — and she’s already shutting out the press.Clinton’s much-anticipated speech at the Moscone Center on Saturday before the National Association of Realtors conference a convention that is drawing 22000 people to San Francisco this week will be blacked out — closed to the media.“So will her big fundraiser Saturday night with Chelsea Clinton at San Francisco’s Regency Ballroom a ‘Millennial Network’ event to benefit the Clinton Foundation.“The decision to bar reporters from the Clinton speech before thousands of Realtors is ‘per her team’s request’ a National Association of Realtors spokeswoman told us in an e-mail Monday.“Seriously? In San Francisco? The easiest Democratic audience in the country? The region that’s home to Twitter Facebook and Google?”And it’s her buckraking that draws fire from National Review’s Victor Davis Hanson:“Hillary Clinton is no doubt a talented speaker. She recently went into what the left wing sees as the heart of darkness of the American 1 percent at Goldman Sachs purportedly gave two brief chats and walked away with a reported $400000 in fees. Such compensation is almost as profitable as Hillary’s long-ago cattle-future trading in which as a talented rookie speculator she beat one-in-several-million odds by parlaying an original $1000 investment into a $100000 profit.“That Goldman’s shenanigans were central to the 2008 housing and financial meltdown — and were empowered in part by Bill Clinton’s own prior twofer of deregulating Wall Street and appointing to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae greedy though liberal incompetents of the likes of James Johnson Franklin Raines and Jamie Gorelick — apparently meant nothing to Hillary.”You can expect to see much more of this if she runs.Confrontational ChristieThere was one speed bump on Chris Christie’s big reelection and that was the image of his wagging a finger at a New Jersey teacher who challenged him.His heated encounter with Melissa Tomlinson of the state’s largest teachers’ union is getting plenty of coverage. Here’s part of her interview with Salon:Christie’s opponent has called him a “bully.” Do you think that’s fair? Is that how you saw him?I’m going to be honest … I haven’t seen enough of him to say “Yes he’s a bully.” Did I feel bullied at the time? Yes I did. I left shaking.Why shaking?It was a kind of a scary confrontation. He shouted at me. The crowd shouted at me. The crowd cheered when he shouted at me. People told me I was in the wrong place to be doing this. People need to understand it has to be done — somebody has to do it.The governor responded in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper:TAPPER: The photograph of this big strong governor berating a poor little teacher as some might see it could be counterproductive to what you want to achieve.CHRISTIE: First is that whole incident as an incident was mischaracterized and overdramatized by the teacher who belongs to a portion of the teachers union.Are there times I wish I would have said something? Sure. But what I think people see in me is that I’m genuine.That’s sort of a microcosm of the debate over Chris Christie and his outsize personality.Top Twitter Talk@DRUDGE: ""McAuliffe De Blasio and Christie: Triple feature in a Republican's nightmare.

316,She then held up her 'redneck version' of Karl Rove's whiteboard (a piece of paper) showing the Obama Scandals:That “self-censoring” Palin said meant a campaign where “we weren’t allowed to tell the truth about who the candidate was Barack Obama.”“What that got us this kind of complacency and self-censoring of a campaign where we weren’t allowed to tell the truth about who this candidate was – Barack Obama – what it got us was a list of these scandals” Palin said.Palin held up a white piece of paper she dubbed “the redneck version of a whiteboard” on which she had scrawled the titles of numerous Obama administration scandals – including Fast & Furious Benghazi and IRS targeting.Because writing them down somehow makes these 'scandals' worse.And what did the McCain brainiacs' silencing of her attempts to speak the truth about Obama get us? Things like reminding us about the 57 states gaffe? (The irony of Gaffemaster Palin bringing up this incident is rich).It got us scandals! Scandals I tellz ya!So it's all John McCain and his brainiacs fault. If Sarah Palin had just been allowed to speak the truth if only Americans knew Barack Obama had visited Bill Ayers in 57 states she and McCain could have won that election!Probably the one right thing John McCain did after the historic error of selecting Sarah Palin half-term governor of Alaska as his running mate was muzzling her immediately. She most likely was told not to talk about anything at all really. Thank you once again John McCain for giving us Sarah Palin in 2008 and thus Barack Obama.,0
317,"Earlier this month while planning a press conference with other lawmakers and tea party leaders in response to the Internal Revenue Service's unfair targeting of conservatives Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann told Tea Party Patriots national coordinator Jenny Beth Martin that she longed to travel and speak to tea party groups more often than she had been able to recently.At the time Martin didn't think much of Bachmann's comment which she said was just made in passing. As planned Martin joined Bachmann and other tea-party-friendly lawmakers outside the U.S. Capitol building on May 16 to speak out against the federal tax collection agency's practices. The IRS controversy helped breathe some new life into the tea party movement by offering a fresh platform to rail against both its targeting of conservatives and its role in implementing the federal health care law.Two weeks later when Bachmann abruptly announced she would not seek re-election to her House seat Martin suddenly remembered what Bachmann had told her. Perhaps she had been hinting at something?""Maybe she couldn't engage in a full-blown campaign at home and also spread the message in the way she is able to around the country"" Martin told Yahoo News in an interview. ""And also at the same time fight the battles on Capitol Hill. There's only so much a single person can do.""From the onset of the movement Bachmann was one of the tea party's most prominent champions in Washington. She co-founded the House Tea Party Caucus in July 2010 spoke at rallies for groups around the country introduced a bill to repeal President Barack Obama's health insurance overhaul immediately after it passed and embraced the tea party label during her short-lived run for president in 2012.When Obama gave his first State of the Union address in 2011 Bachmann made waves by giving a televised ""tea party response"" in coordination with Tea Party Express. To many she was (and is) the face of the tea party in the capital city.Story continuesBachmann's decision to leave Congress came as an abrupt surprise to tea party coordinators according to Martin and Tea Party Express Chairwoman Amy Kremer two leaders of tea party groups that have worked closely with Bachmann since the movement's early days during Obama's first term. Bachmann was traveling in Russia and out of pocket when her video announcing the decision was posted online on Wednesday morning leaving tea party leaders to draw their own conclusions about the reason for her departure.Tea party organizers said they were disappointed by Bachmann's move but they say they hope she will continue working with them when she leaves office. They also expressed hope that she will seek office again soon by running for Senate or launching another bid for the presidency.""We have not heard the last of her"" Kremer told Yahoo News. ""Just because she's not seeking re-election for her congressional seat doesn't mean she won't run for higher office at some point. I still think she has a platform.""Kremer was quick to add that as a movement established to function without an identifiable leader she does not anticipate that Bachmann's departure will mean the end of the tea party.""She's been a strong and vocal voice for us but the tea party movement is so diverse and there are so many people involved with different local groups different national groups. The tea party movement is not focused on any one individual or any one organization"" Kremer said. ""The tea party movement is what it is because of the people who are out there across the country not because of any one leader whether it is a leader of an organization or somebody in the halls of Congress.""",1
318,"NEW YORK — Anthony Weiner is out with a new ad addressing the sexting scandal that threatens to sink his mayoral campaign in which he reaffirms he has no plans to “quit” the race.The minute-long spot posted Tuesday evening on Weiner’s campaign site features the former congressman speaking directly to the camera about the state of his mayoral bid.""You know sometimes people say to me 'This campaign is pretty rough. You may want to quit.' I know there are newspaper editors and other politicians that say ‘Boy I wish that guy Weiner would quit’” the Democratic mayoral hopeful says in the spot. “You don’t know New York. You certainly don’t know me. Quit isn’t the way we roll in New York City. We fight through tough things. We are a tough city.”This content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.The spot was released exactly one week after Weiner admitted that he continued to send sexual messages to women he met online even after he was forced out of Congress for similar online dalliances. His wife Huma Abedin who joined him in his other campaign ad is not featured in his latest spot.Weiner who looks visibly tired in the ad insists the race is not about him but “helping New Yorkers.”“If someone wants to come out with something embarrassing about you in your private life you have to talk about that for a little while” Weiner says. “But it’s also reminded me that citizens when they come up to ya and they want to talk to you about a situation on their block or at their child’s school or something going on at their job site that’s what this campaign is all about and I’ll never forget that.""It’s unclear if the campaign is reserving television airtime for the spot. A spokeswoman for Weiner did not respond to a request for comment.",1
319,Editor’s note: This piece from Roger Pilon first appeared on the National Review Online website just before the Senate’s historic filibuster vote and it appears with the CATO Institute’s permission.Harry Reid is set to “go nuclear.” He wants to end the filibuster as it applies to appellate court nominations — not by a two-thirds vote of the Senate as Senate rules require but by a simple majority. And given the short memories now in evidence he may just succeed.On Monday for the third time in less than a month Senate Republicans filibustered an Obama nominee to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. That’s the court that’s checked the president more than once as when it said he couldn’t make “recess appointments” when the Senate wasn’t in recess. So in a Tuesday closed-door lunch Reid moved closer to ending the practice and it’s reported he picked up crucial support from California Democratic senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer along with Judiciary Committee chairman Patrick Leahy among others.The hypocrisy here should not go unnoticed. Although the filibuster for legislation has a long history prior to 2003 it was seldom used to block executive-branch nominations — and appellate-court nominees in particular. In fact Democrats themselves began using it this way in the 108th Congress after they lost the Senate in the 2002 midterm elections. Here’s the backstory.Start with Bush v. Gore the Supreme Court’s December 2000 decision that effectively decided the presidential outcome creating a firestorm among Democrats especially among the legal professoriate. On January 13 2001 for example 554 professors from 120 law schools took out a full-page ad in the New York Times condemning the Court’s majority for having acted not as judges but as “political proponents for candidate Bush.” And at a Democratic retreat a month later Yale’s Bruce Ackerman urged members not to confirm a single Bush nominee for the Supreme Court until after the 2004 elections.Story continuesDemocrats got their break in May when Vermont senator James Jeffords left the Republican party. That switched control of the Senate to the Democrats who immediately turned their attention to the eleven appellate court nominees then before the Senate Judiciary Committee two of them Democrats — a gesture from Bush. Those two were immediately confirmed. The rest would not even get hearings. Instead Democrats began calling for “litmus tests” — explicit demands that nominees state their views on everything from abortion to affirmative action to Congress’s unquestioned power to regulate anything and everything.But the near lock-down on appellate-court nominations did not end with the 2002 midterm elections which switched control of the Senate back to the Republicans. It was then that Senate Democrats began the unprecedented filibustering of appellate-court nominations. The most egregious case was that of Miguel Estrada whose life story was pure American dream. First nominated by President Bush in May 2001 Estrada finally withdrew his name from further consideration some 27 months later after seven failed cloture votes in the next 108th Congress.Things came to a head early in the 109th Congress when Republicans themselves still in control of the Senate threatened finally to “go nuclear” — to end the appellate-court filibusters Democrats had introduced only in the previous Congress. That was headed off when the bipartisan “Gang of 14” reached a compromise: Democrats would filibuster nominees only in “extraordinary circumstances” they agreed and Republicans would not use the nuclear option. That compromise held for the rest of the 109th Congress — though not without difficulties — but it became moot after Democrats regained control of the Senate following the 2006 midterm elections since they no longer needed to filibuster Bush nominees.In sum after the 2000 election was decided Senate Democrats sat on their hands for two years as Bush appellate-court nominees twisted in the wind. In the minority after the 2002 elections those Democrats then initiated the filibuster for many of Bush’s nominees. Only after the 2005 Gang of 14 compromise was imposed did things settle down. And after the 2006 elections Democrats no longer needed to filibuster.So is the Republican use of the filibuster today simply fair turn-around — with Democrats in no position to complain when Republicans use tactics they themselves introduced? If so that would be enough to illustrate the hypocrisy of today’s Democratic protests. But that’s not what’s at issue here. In the D.C. Circuit matter which has driven Senator Reid to the nuclear option Republicans are not raising ideological objections to Obama’s nominees — as Democrats did when they filibustered Bush’s picks. Their objection rather is that these judges are not needed because the workload of the court is so light. In fact speaking of hypocrisy Democrats in the minority in the 109th Congress used that very rationale to urge Judiciary Committee chairman Arlen Specter in a July 2006 letter not to confirm any additional Bush nominees to the D.C. Circuit — and none was confirmed after that letter from Senators Leahy Feinstein Schumer and Durbin was sent all of whom are still on the committee. Yet now when the court’s workload is even lighter Democrats cry foul when Republicans point that out.In fact look at the numbers from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. In 2006 written decisions per active judge had declined by 17 percent since 1997. Since 2006 they have declined another 27 percent. In 2006 the total number of appeals filed had declined by 10 percent since 1997. Since 2006 they have declined another 18 percent. The Administrative Office ranks the twelve circuits using various caseload benchmarks: 2013 is the 17th straight year that the office has ranked the D.C. Circuit last on both appeals being filed and appeals being terminated. There simply is no need for more judges on the D.C. Circuit when those there now do not have enough to do — unless of course the aim is to have a bench more sympathetic to rule by presidential diktat which may be precisely why Senator Reid wants to go nuclear.Roger Pilon is vice president for legal affairs at the Cato Institute and director of Cato’s Center for Constitutional Studies.Recent Filibuster StoriesFilibuster Reaction: Harry Reid’s nuclear hypocrisyFilibuster Reaction: The vote that will change AmericaLooking at Harry Reid’s statement about filibusters and the ConstitutionIn defense of the filibuster,1
320,"8 years ago[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'][twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN'](CNN) – Anthony Weiner's top opponents for New York City's Democratic mayoral race each got a chance to address the former congressman in a major televised debate Tuesday night but City Council Speaker Christine Quinn took more than one shot at the flagging candidate as the two engaged in heated exchanges throughout the night.Two minutes deep into the five-candidate showdown Weiner was already acknowledging and apologizing for his sexting scandal but he urged voters to move beyond his ""personal failings"" and focus on the more substantive issues in the race.""At the end of the day this campaign is not about me or about anyone else on this stage it's about you"" he said looking at the camera.All four of his opponents on stage agreed with each saying they're tired of talking about Weiner. Public Advocate Bill de Blasio added the former congressman ""should step aside for the good of the city.""""We need a debate on the issues"" he said. ""We should not be talking about one individual and their personal life.""City Comptroller John Liu pleaded: ""Please don't ask me any more questions about him.""Weiner has vowed to stay in the running despite his sharp drop in the polls after admitting last month that he continued having online relationships with women for more than a year after his 2011 resignation from Congress.At Tuesday night's debate-hosted by WABC New York Daily News Univision and the League of Women Voters-Quinn said Weiner was ""right"" in that New Yorkers have ""heard a lot about his personal issues.""""For me the bigger issue is his record"" she said before taking a swipe at the limited amount of legislation passed under his name during his dozen years in Congress.Hitting back Weiner faulted Quinn for getting term limits overturned an unpopular move that allowed Mayor Michael Bloomberg to win a third term and allowed Quinn to stay in the speaker's office.""The speaker refuses to apologize for overturning the will of the people"" he said. ""I've owned up to my personal failings but I have a record that I'm proud of...and that's not something the speaker can claim.""Quinn stood by her decision on term limits and argued neither she nor any other New Yorker ""should be lectured by Anthony Weiner about what we need to apologize for tonight–or ever.""As the field of candidates which also included former City Comptroller Bill Thompson debated local issues Weiner stepped in to paint himself as an outsider.""This is the problem: They all come from basically the same place. They've been part of municipal government for decades now"" he argued. ""If you want someone truly independent who's going to stop this noise ... you have a choice here.""Turning to Weiner Quinn begged to differ.""Not for nothing you were in government your whole career until you had to resign from government so I'm not sure why you're finger-pointing at people in government"" she said.Tuesday's debate came hours after a new poll showed a dramatic switch in the race. According to the Quinnipiac University survey de Blasio jumped to the front of the pack with 30% of support among likely Democratic primary voters.Quinn the former front-runner fell behind with 24% and Thompson came in at 22% just four weeks before the September 10 primary. Weiner remained behind all three at 10% while Liu had 6% support.",1
321,SCOTTSDALE Ariz. — The Democratic National Committee’s summer meeting here late last week was starkly different from the gathering of its Republican counterparts earlier in the month. There were no surefire news-making speakers like Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey or former Speaker Newt Gingrich nor was there consideration of any made-for-cable-news resolutions like one that tried to bar a pair of television networks from sponsoring future presidential debates.Rather it was a sedate gathering where routine party business was conducted routinely by national and state Democratic officials in a suburban Phoenix resort.But when Harold M. Ickes walked into the Rules and Bylaws Committee meeting on Thursday afternoon and rejoined the panel at least one longtime Democratic strategist raised her eyebrows.“He predated the Clinton era but when I saw Harold reappointed to the D.N.C. he surely in my judgment symbolizes the return of the Clintons” said Donna Brazile a fellow member of the rules committee.Mr. Ickes said he was put back on the committee by Debbie Wasserman Schultz chairwoman of the national committee and herself an ardent advocate for Mrs. Clinton in 2008 but he also acknowledged that he “actively sought” the seat.“It is in my view the most important committee at the D.N.C. because of its role in shaping the nomination process” he said adding a bit mischievously “The goal is to design rules to nominate the strongest candidate for the general election.”That he added would be up to the voters but there is no question who he believes that candidate is.Mr. Ickes 73 is a fixture in the Clinton’s world. He ran Bill Clinton’s New York campaign in the 1992 Democratic primary and served as a deputy chief of staff in Mr. Clinton’s White House. He was a top adviser to Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign and Mrs. Clinton’s chief liaison at the D.N.C. during her primary battle against Barack Obama. From his perch on the rules committee he memorably railed against a compromise on disputed delegates in the waning days of the Democratic primary.At a notably less sedate national committee meeting in late May 2008 Mr. Ickes argued in vain against what he called the “hijacking” of Mrs. Clinton’s delegate share from two disputed state primaries. “I am stunned that we have the gall and the chutzpah to substitute our judgment for 600000 voters” Mr. Ickes said at the time.A few weeks later Mrs. Clinton conceded the race to Mr. Obama. The following year with Mr. Obama as party leader Mr. Ickes left his rules committee post. According to party records he had served on the rules panel since at least 1992.“I was not reappointed after the 2008 election for some pretty obvious reasons” Mr. Ickes said.Now five years later — with Mr. Obama a lame duck and speculation soaring about whether Mrs. Clinton will seek the White House again — her procedural maven is back in his old position at the national party. The rules committee is tasked with setting the guidelines governing the presidential nominating process.Mrs. Clinton does not lack for support among national committee members — that much was obvious by the rate in which unofficial campaign buttons promoting her for 2016 were sold in the hallway outside the conference room here.But with Mr. Ickes a canny tactician with decades of presidential campaign experience again on the rules committee she has a strategist on a key committee who could advocate for her interest.As one party official put it Mr. Ickes not only knows how the party works but effectively “wrote the rules” for the national committee over the years at least until he was thwarted by Mr. Obama.Mr. Ickes said he did not rejoin the committee at the behest of either Mr. or Mrs. Clinton but conceded that he understood the meaning of his reappearance as Democrats begin to consider life after Mr. Obama.“I was on the rules committee for years and years but yes I can understand people reading it that way” he said.,0
322,A new poll from NBC New York and Marist College says that disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner (D-NY) who lied to the American public about tweeting pictures of his junk to random women around the country is now running a hard second in a potential mayoral matchup. Christine Quinn the current Speaker of the House in New York runs first with 26 percent of the vote; Weiner follows with 15 percent. While Nate Silver of the New York Times suggests that this number is actually limp for Weiner given his 100 percent name recognition it still gives him a leg up on the rest of the crowd.It’s no coincidence that Weiner is now preparing to get on his hands and knees before the public in New York. As USA Today reports Weiner says “I think I’ll be spending a lot of time here on out saying I’m sorry.”Weiner and his wife Huma are plastered on the new cover of the New York Times Magazine. He still refuses to answer questions about his tweet scandal. But it’s clear he understands he’s got to get the monkey of the story off his back or he’ll take a spanking at the ballot box. He says “I have been excruciatingly honest in letter by letter detail by detail with my wife. An embarrassing amount is in the public domain … But out of respect for the idea that I’ve laid it all out for her and out of some respect for the privacy of the people who were at the other end of these correspondences who had their lives turned upside down I am not going to go into the details of every bit of it.”Respect for his own possible mayoral run is more like it. He’s relying on his new book Keys to the City to carry him to victory. According to Weiner the penis apparently mightier than the rhetorical sword.Ben Shapiro is Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News and author of the New York Times bestseller “Bullies: How the Left’s Culture of Fear and Intimidation Silences America” (Threshold Editions January 8 2013).,1
323,Entire touch-football rosters could be filled with Kennedys who could never have been elected at their tender ages without their last names. In November Ted’s 32-year-old cousin Joseph Kennedy III — the son of a former U.S. representative Joseph Kennedy II — became the latest pledge when he won the congressional seat left by Barney Frank who retired. Even Ted Jr.’s son Edward Kennedy III has announced his intention to run for U.S. senator from Massachusetts someday. He was at the time of his announcement 11.“There is this question with every member of my family” Patrick Kennedy said. “How do we fit into this amazing legacy that we have been given by dint of our birth?” That is not a sentence most people utter. But his point was that simply running for an office because it is available is the family default option and it’s not necessarily the best one.Patrick did not seek re-election in 2010 and now devotes much of his life to promoting treatment and research for his twin causes mental illness and brain injuries. He married moved to New Jersey and has two children. He has sad green eyes a big pillow of red hair and the gawky bearing of an overgrown boy. But he also has the weary voice of someone who could be 65.Patrick told me he has no regrets about his career choices but his own life proves his original point: that the family reflex to run early is not for everyone. He has battled depression and alcohol and drug addictions for years and he admits that the United States Congress was not the best place to wrestle these goblins. “When you grow up in my family being somebody meant having power having status” Patrick told me back in 2006 when I was reporting an article for The Times not long after police found him disoriented having crashed his car into a barrier near the Capitol at 2:45 a.m. “The compensations you got were all material and superficial” he said. “I’ve come to realize in the last few months that that life made me feel all alone.” After the article ran Patrick told me his father was furious at him for unburdening himself publicly. “Save that stuff for your shrink not a reporter” Senator Kennedy said to him.Ted Jr. is less the unburdening type. He has granted few interviews and he seemed nervous when we talked or perhaps a bit suffocated by Keil who was always with us. Keil whom I first met back in his journalism days is a friendly and earnest operator who like many in Washington is always working. (I ran into him once at the supermarket and teased him about the work Purple Strategies was doing to help BP “reposition” its image after the spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Without missing a beat Keil unleashed his own gusher calling BP the “the greatest corporate turnaround story in history” before moving on to the deli counter.) He sat in on all three of my meetings with Ted Jr. monitored a subsequent phone call and also stayed close by during my meeting with Patrick. He made backup recordings of all of our conversations which is not unusual for public-relations people to do but typically happens with high-level subjects not with someone who has never run for office and wasn’t really running for anything now. The aggressive “management” of the story conveyed an impression of both loftiness and hand-holding — or at worst of a Not Ready for Prime Time Kennedy being propped up by consultants.All of that said there’s something innately likable about Ted Jr. People who have known him over the years generally describe a solid down-to-earth guy who is quite normal given his royal lineage. And his instinct to become a fully formed human being before answering the “call to service” was admirable. His priority by all accounts has always been to raise a family and nurture them as unassumingly as possible (again for a Kennedy). As he put it “I pretty much spent half my life trying to resist other people’s timetables.” Later when I asked him to elaborate on this he added: “My father was the single most important person in my life. But in some ways we all live our lives resisting what our parents want us to become.”In early 1985 Ted Jr. was 23 and living in Somerville Mass. outside Boston. Tip O’Neill the district’s longtime representative had announced he would retire at the end of his term. This seemed an obvious starter gig but Ted Jr. was not interested. His 34-year-old cousin Joe — Robert F. Kennedy’s son — ran and won instead. “I never seriously considered that race” Ted Jr. told me. “My father was strongly considering me.” Ted Sr. commissioned a poll that came back “a slam dunk for Ted” said Steve McMahon who was one of the people then running Senator Kennedy’s political operation. Ted Jr.’s decision not to run McMahon said “was against the advice and counsel of pretty much everyone around him.” Senator Kennedy was disappointed Ted Jr. told me. “He couldn’t understand why someone with all the built-in advantages would not take advantage of the opportunity.”,1
324,"But all told a critical look at some of the activities of those tea party applicants currently under review by IREHR or those already designated as 501(C)(4) reveals the potential for a threat to democratic governance in general.From the IREHR website: The Tea Party and the IRS “Scandal” The Actual Facts of the CaseHere are the not-so-known facts of a few of those cases:• The First Coast Tea Party Inc. of Jacksonville Florida for example which applied for 501(c)(4) status in 2009 and received it in 2011. Commenting about the recent IRS controversy on Facebook the group declared “We file a tax return account for every penny.. We do not endorse candidates that is a no no.” Yet the group’s activities included public bragging about directly helping Republican campaigns. In an August 30 2012 Facebook post for instance the group advertised a Jacksonville rally for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan adding “bring your chairs and your signs make sure they know that the First Coast Tea Party is and has been helping their campaign.”It must be noted here that three weeks after receiving 501(C)(4) status the group declared a ""state of emergency"" on their Facebook page pleading with supporters to campaign for Romney.THIS is just one example of why the IRS wanted all their Facebook postings.“FLORIDA FRIENDS IF YOU LIVE IN ANY OF THESE 3 COUNTIES GET OFF THE COUCH NOW GET YOUR FRIENDS OFF THE COUCH. GET TO THE REPUBLICAN HEADQUARTERS AND OFFER AND THEN DO SOME WORK. PHONES (YOU CAN EVEN DO THESE CALLS FROM HOME) AND WALK AND KNOCK. NOW. WE CANNOT LOSE FLORIDA TO OBAMA.. NOW. THIS IS MOST CRITICAL.” [Emphasis in Original]That plea came from the official Face book account of the organization as opposed to coming from random supporters.• Similarly the Louisville Tea Party was granted 501(c)(4) status in 2009. Nevertheless it published a list of “officially tea party endorsed candidates for the 2011 Kentucky primary.” They also published an article “The Rationale for Romney-Ryan” arguing for Tea Partiers to vote for the Republican candidate.Then there’s...• The Katy Tea Party Patriots which filed for 501(c)(4) non-profit status in 2009. This group actually ran an “Oust Obama 2012” campaign organizing block-watching with the Fort Bend GOP and phone-banking against Obama at GOP headquarters in Sugarland and Houston Texas. Still featured on the frontpage of the group’s website at the time this article was written is an October 4 2012 article entitled “Our Country's Future” by Katy Tea Party Patriots President Darcy Kahrhoff. She urged members to vote for Gov. Romney. ""Please take time to talk with friends and family you may have living out of state and try to convince them to vote for Governor Romney especially if you have friends and family in Florida Colorado or Ohio. Also find a Senatorial candidate to support in these states and go to FreedomWorks to phone bank for these patriots. Everything you can do to help will matter. We can and we must win this!""Not to be outdone...• The Central Valley Tea Party Inc. This regional California Tea Party group was granted the much more politically limiting IRS 501(c)(3) tax status back in 2009. It should be noted that this tax-status explicitly prohibits partisan political activity. According the IRS “Under the Internal Revenue Code all section 501(c)(3) organizations are absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in or intervening in any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office. The prohibition applies to all campaigns including campaigns at the federal state and local level. Violation of this prohibition may result in denial or revocation of tax-exempt status and the imposition of certain excise taxes.”Despite this (c)(3) designation the front-page of the group's website features ""upcoming events"" instructing members to ""Volunteer for Measure G"" and ""Volunteer for Vidak for Senate.” In the latter case the website simply tells members...""Please volunteer to do phone banking or precinct walking to help win the election.""""So it’s time to get excited to vote for the better candidate. It’s time to talk him up to friends and family. It’s time to join with groups like Operation Swing State (www.operationswingstate.org) and make calls in support of his candidacy.""In an article in the October 2012 issue of the Central Valley Tea Party Times entitledPaul Szopa told fellow Central Valley Tea Partiers to get out and campaign for GOP presidential candidate Mitt RomneyAnother Tea Party group granted the 501(c)(3) non-profit status by the IRS...• The Tifton Georgia-based Tiftarea Tea Party Patriots Inc. which received the designation in 2010. The group also appears to have engaged in openly political activity including publicly endorsing candidates. On October 9 2012 in a post on the group’s website “Are you ready to vote?” the group offered up an endorsement for Romney “The choice is simple. Obama has stated He will transform America and acted to do such. Everything this Administration stands for is Government and control of every aspect of life. This is the pipe dream of a Socialist’s mentality for in their eyes you the individual do not know and cannot do what is right so someone else has to make decisions for you to ensure you do not make the wrong choices or actions. Or you chose Romney who does not want to transform America the greatest nation in history of human kind. He wants to allow the individual to have the right to succeed and fail on his own regard while ensuring those freedoms given by our Creator and to assure those inalienable rights written about in the Declaration of Independence are retained by their proper owners ‘We the People.’”Note these are only a few of the many examples of blatant political involvement by tea party 'non-profits' reviewed by IREHR. Of course there are plenty more. As the title of this diary indicates the REAL scandal here is how often the IRS granted 501(C)(4) status to groups that egregiously violated standards.Even though the agency was clearly inundated with applications there's no excuse for the incompetency of its employees. As far as I know the agency was at full strength; no cutbacks no furloughs... just incompetency.Now one must ask:After the firing of several high level IRS employees over this incident how likely is it that Tea Party groups will be prevented these sorts of violations in the future?I don't know if we want to know the answer to that question.Here's an article written for Salon.com by Joan Walsh highlighting what appears to be one of the few groups denied 501(C)(4) status -- a Democratic group.",0

326,"UNITED STATES - MARCH 15: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell R-Ky. speaks next to a tower of 20000 pages of health care rules and regulations at the 2013 Conservative Political Action Conference at the Gaylord National Resort & Conference Center at National Harbor Md. on Friday March 15 2013. (Photo By Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call)Will the implementation of some of the most important provisions of ObamaCare this fall and next year result in the ""train wreck"" Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) predicted a few days ago?No. But you can be certain that there will be no shortage of political candidates and high-powered political spin doctors who will be working relentlessly between now and the 2014 midterms to convince us that it will be.ObamaCare -- even though it already has reduced the number of uninsured Americans by several million and has limited price gouging by insurance companies -- represents the best hope that many Republicans will have of maintaining or boosting their majority in the House and possibly retaking the Senate.Think about it. The economy seems to be on the right track. Just last week the stock market reached record highs and the jobless rate fell to its lowest point in four years. The war in Iraq is over and most American troops are scheduled to be out of Afghanistan by the end of next year. The GOP appears to have lost the advantage to Democrats on gun control and immigration and abortion and gay rights are no longer the reliable campaign wedge issues they once were.That leaves ObamaCare and ""big government spending"" as just about the only issues that remain for right-leaning candidates barring any unforeseen domestic or global calamity. But if their campaigns against ObamaCare next year are as successful as their campaigns against it were in the 2010 midterms -- and the White House and supporters of the law are once again asleep at the switch -- GOP candidates might not need anything else to talk about to take both houses of Congress.When Barack Obama was inaugurated in January 2009 there was wide support for health care reform and Republican strategists knew it. They realized they might be able to turn reform into a winning issue for their candidates by mounting a campaign to make people afraid of what the Democrats might try to do. So just as Congress was beginning preliminary work on what eventually became the Affordable Care Act GOP message guru Frank Luntz persuaded his clients to condemn whatever the Democrats proposed as a ""government takeover of health care.""Even though the bill that ultimately became law was anything but a government takeover GOP lawmakers and candidates never missed an opportunity to insist that it was. Luntz' sound bite was repeated hundreds of times in floor speeches by Republican members of Congress in the hours before the House voted on its version of the bill on November 7 2009.Their fear-based campaign worked so well to influence public opinion that GOP candidates have never stopped using the ""government takeover"" meme which is why the perception of ObamaCare as being exactly that has become a reality for millions of Americans.When you consider the inadequate job that the White House and the president's supporters have done in explaining how the law benefits just about every one of us -- and never letting us forget why reform was necessary in the first place -- it's little wonder Republicans see opportunity once again.There no doubt will be glitches when the online health insurance exchanges go live on October 1 for the relatively small percentage of Americans who will use them to shop for coverage because their employers don't offer health insurance as an employee benefit. The exchanges will work just fine for the vast majority of people but there will be some who will have complaints. You can expect the law's critics to give every one of them a voice in their effort to create the impression that the exchanges are a disaster and that the government can't do anything right.Similarly some people who have been paying relatively low premiums for what they don't realize is junk insurance will be upset when junk insurance is outlawed next year. Because real insurance costs more than junk some invariably will complain about having to pay higher premiums for coverage that will actually be there if and when they need it.You can also expect that a fair number of folks will squawk when the requirement to have health insurance kicks in on January 1. And you can bet that the opponents of the law will be aided unwittingly in most but certainly not all cases by the media. Just as local TV reporters tell us about the drivers who crash into each other instead of the rest of us who get to our destinations unharmed the media will focus on the glitches. And they'll interview far more complainers than happy campers.I'm betting that Frank Luntz and other Republican strategists have already been hired to craft the sound bites to use against Democrats next year. If the Democrats and consumer advocates who support ObamaCare are not at work developing their own strategies to counter the coming barrage of misleading spin the GOP will have an excellent chance of controlling Capitol Hill after the next elections.",1
327,"Former President Bill Clinton declined to weigh in on the campaign for mayor of New York City -- and the sexting scandal engulfing mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner -- telling CNN on Tuesday ""We are a hundred miles from that race.""""Everyone understands that we are not going to be involved as long as our personal friends and people who we feel obligations [to] are involved"" said Clinton speaking from Rwanda where he was doing work through his foundation.""Neither Hillary or I was ever involved in the political campaign and they understood that from the beginning"" he said of Weiner's bid. ""There are too many people running for mayor who have been my supporters who supported her for senator her for president.""""The feelings I have are all personal and since they are I shouldn't talk about them"" he added.Clinton's comments the first he's made on the New York City campaign were extremely judicious. But they also serve to distance the Clintons from Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin who remains an aide to Hillary Clinton.Many have compared Weiner and Abedin to the Clintons who in their younger years stuck together through a scandal. But that comparison has reportedly infuriated the Clintons.Nevertheless the two worlds overlap with Abedin maintaining close contact with Hillary Clinton as her husband's campaign persistently moves forward.For his part Weiner said recently that he has ""enormous respect"" for the Clintons and called them ""tremendous friends.""",1

MooreUSA TODAYAnthony Weiner quit Congress after a sexting scandal in 2011Wife says she has forgiven himWeiner says he won%27t drop out of the raceNEW YORK -- Former congressman Anthony Weiner D-N.Y. said he would not quit his race for mayor of New York City despite acknowledging that he continued to send women inappropriate online messages after a sexting scandal forced him to resign from Congress in 2011.""I said that other texts and photos were likely to come out and today they have"" Weiner said in a hastily arranged news conference with his wife by his side. Weiner acknowledged that some of the inappropriate texts were sent after he had resigned.""Some of these things happened before my resignation some of them happened after"" Weiner said.""I'm sure many of my opponents would like me to drop out of the race"" he said but he refused to drop out of the race. After the news conference he went directly to a mayoral candidate forum.""Anthony has made some horrible mistakes both before he resigned from Congress and after"" said Weiner's wife Huma Abedin. ""I love him I have forgiven him I believe in him.""An online gossip site called The Dirty posted screenshots Monday of online messages between an account in the name of Anthony Weiner and that of an unidentified woman. The site said the messages were sent last August more than a year after Weiner left Congress. Weiner discusses her potential involvement in a blog for Politico the political news site and talks about his cats. He also asks the woman to delete other messages they exchanged.A second salacious chat exchange posted by The Dirty was from an account using the name Carlos Danger which the site quoting the unidentified woman says is Weiner.Weiner stepped down from Congress in June 2011 after admitting that he had texted lewd pictures of himself to women reversing previous denials. In May Weiner entered the race for New York City mayor and his wife an aide to former secretary of State Hillary Clinton is campaigning for him. The couple have an 18-month-old son.On Tuesday Weiner said his behavior was ""problematic to say the least and self-destructive to say the most"" but he reminded reporters that he had said at the time that more pictures and messages might be out there. The messages revealed Monday ""don't represent all that much that is new.""Because of the upcoming Sept. 10 Democratic primary ""I'm surprised that more things didn't come out sooner"" he said Tuesday.""While some things that have been posted today are true and some are not there is no question that what I did was wrong"" Weiner said in a written statement. ""This behavior is behind me. I've apologized to Huma and am grateful that she has worked through these issues with me and for her forgiveness. I want to again say that I am very sorry to anyone who was on the receiving end of these messages and the disruption that this has caused. As my wife and I have said we are focused on moving forward.""At the news conference Weiner refused to detail which of the messages were authentic.Sometimes smiling and sometimes near tears the elegantly dressed Abedin a top aide to Hillary Clinton addressed one of the biggest questions of the Weiner story: why she is still married to him. ""It took a lot of work and a whole lot of therapy to get to the point where I could forgive Anthony"" she said.Staying with Weiner ""was not an easy choice in any way"" she said. ""But I made a decision that it was worth staying in this marriage. that was a decision I made for me for our son and for our family. I didn't know how it would work out but I did know that I wanted to give it a try.""George Arzt a New York Democratic political consultant said the new revelations would make Weiner's campaign much harder particularly with former N.Y. governor Eliot Spitzer running for city comptroller after his own sex scandal.""Obviously he has a lot of problems plus the fact that I think that Spitzer has taken a lot of air out of his balloon because they have overlapping aberrant behavior"" Arzt said.

330,"Add Erik Rush to the list of prominent wingnuts calling for a coup against Obama. The WorldNutDaily columnist and frequent Faux News guest is out with a new column that calls for Obama to be overthrown ""by any means necessary""--even if they aren't legal.I have said previously that if a preponderance of Americans suddenly became aware of what I and a few others know (not “believe” but know) they would stream into our nation’s capital by the millions concern for personal safety cast aside in light of that which is at stake. They would demand the resignation of those in this administration as well as many who have facilitated its crimes. Seeing this these ruling class elites would have no choice but to retreat – or to attempt to forcibly quell the movement. Such action at that point would undoubtedly fail given the determination of so large and motivated a host. This administration much of the Congress and the creatures who support the same in blissful belligerent ignorance must be neutralized if this nation is to survive in any semblance of its intended form. And it must be done by any means necessary because such criminals have proven that they are not dissuaded by trifles like legality. The law in our President’s estimation is what he says it is. This has been proven time and again. So Obama and his cabal and in all likelihood a substantial segment of Congress must go. We must also extricate the radicals and Islamists whom Obama has so kindly insinuated into high places in our government. And the culture of our government must change. Indeed it will take some time and sacrifice but America has never faced a threat such as this. In truth I don’t think any nation has.Rush maintains that nothing short of a coup is necessary to pull the country from ""the brink of totalitarianism."" The best that can be said about this sentiment is that Rush is blind in his right eye. After all we now know that a substantial element of the GOP deliberately planned to defund Obamacare knowing full well it would cause a shutdown. Tell me how that isn't undemocratic.Moreover Rush is the last person to wring his hands about authoritarian excess. Before the 2012 election he claimed that the first priority for a Romney administration should have been to arrest Democrats and journalists for treason--a claim that he reiterated back in July. In the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombings he called for all Muslims to be lined up and shot.I really have to wonder--what does it say about Faux News and WorldNutDaily that this guy is still associated with them?",1
331,"7 years agoWashington (CNN) - What a difference a month makes.A new CNN/ORC International poll indicates a dramatic turnaround in the battle for control of Congress in next year's midterm elections.Democrats a month ago held a 50%-42% advantage among registered voters in a generic ballot which asked respondents to choose between a Democrat or Republican in their congressional district without identifying the candidates.That result came after congressional Republicans appeared to overplay their hand in the bitter fight over the federal government shutdown and the debt ceiling.But the Democratic lead has disappeared. A new CNN/ORC poll indicates the GOP now holds a 49%-47% edge.The new survey was conducted last week and released Tuesday.The 10-point swing follows a political uproar over Obamacare which included the botched rollout of HealthCare.gov and controversy over insurance policy cancelations due primarily to the new health law.The turnaround in the CNN/ORC poll follows similar shifts in recent national surveys from Quinnipiac University and Fox News.At a news conference two weeks ago President Barack Obama acknowledged that problems plaguing the startup of the new healthcare law could hurt Democrats.""There is no doubt that our failure to rollout the ACA smoothly has put a burden on Democrats whether they are running or not because they stood up and supported this effort through thick and thin"" Obama said.The CNN/ORC poll released as the President makes a West Coast campaign fundraising swing on behalf of fellow Democrats indicates both parties making gains within their base.""It looks like the biggest shifts toward the Republicans came among white voters higher-income Americans and people who live in rural areas while Democrats have gained strength in the past month among some of their natural constituencies such as non-white voters and lower-income Americans"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.""If those patterns persist into 2014 it may indicate that Obamacare is popular among those who it was designed to help the most but unpopular among the larger group of voters who are personally less concerned about health insurance and health care"" Holland said.Republicans currently have a 17-seat advantage in the U.S. House with the Democrats holding a 55-45 majority in the Senate.While the generic ballot question is one of the most commonly used indicators when it comes to the battle for Congress the poll results are a long way from predicting what will happen next November.""There is just under a year to go before any votes are actually cast and the 'generic ballot' question is not necessarily a good predictor of the actual outcome of 435 separate elections"" Holland cautions.""A year before the 2010 midterms for example the Democrats held a six-point lead on the generic ballot but the GOP wound up regaining control of the House in that election cycle thanks to an historic 63-seat pickup"" he said.The poll was conducted November 18-20 for CNN by ORC International with 843 adult Americans including 749 registered voters questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.",0

333,WASHINGTON — Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona likes President Obama voted to give him the authority to strike Syria supported the comprehensive immigration legislation favored by the White House and works comfortably with members of the opposing party.The six-term House Republican who is now serving his first term in the Senate also is a rock-ribbed conservative especially on economic and fiscal issues. He has been a darling of the Club for Growth; before going to Congress he ran the Goldwater Institute in his home state.As a conservative who mixes conviction and civility he is a member of a vanishing breed. He stands out among the Tea Party-driven congressional Republicans who are threatening to shut down the government or risk a U.S. default by refusing to increase the debt ceiling — and do not withhold their venom toward Mr. Obama. (Representative Kerry Bentivolio of Michigan for example delights his constituents with his relish for a presidential impeachment. His animosity runs so deep that he said he “couldn’t stand” to be in the same room with Mr. Obama.)On most social questions Mr. Flake is squarely on the right. He opposes abortion rights and unlike Arizona’s senior senator John McCain he refused to break with orthodoxy and support a mild background check for gun buyers. He is a Mormon — a graduate of Brigham Young University in Utah and a former missionary in Africa — and opposes same-sex marriage. But he is not a demagogue; in the House he voted to repeal the military’s “don’t ask don’t tell” restriction and to allow gays to serve in the armed forces.,1

I’m clean’ ” said Roye who is chief public health inspector for St. Elizabeth parish. “Those are the exact words he said to me.”The usually media-shy Thompson basked in the spotlight each year during the televised black-tie NAACP Image Awards. For more than a decade TCBA had been the accounting firm that tabulated the results. But last year the NAACP used other accountants.President Obama Gov. O’Malley Del. Norton and Del. Donna M. Christensen who represents the U.S. Virgin Islands have returned contributions they believed were associated with Thompson. Sen. Timothy M. Kaine (D-Va.) also returned money that had been given to his gubernatorial campaign.TCBA is now BCA. Thompson sold his 79 percent interest to Ralph Bazilio. He has sold some of his properties including the salon that he allowed his hairdresser to use.Lawyer Charles Parsons sued Thompson when he tried to renege on the sale of the salon. “His assets are being stripped and here I was one of the strippers” Parsons said.Parsons said he met with Thompson in person three or four times. They settled in March. Parsons noticed that Thompson never showed up in his tailor-made suits.“I thought he would be a very arrogant guy. . . . He’s had so much money sloshing around the gas tank” Parsons said. “The fact of the matter is he wasn’t without his charm. He saw the humor in things. He laughed. He was laughing at a time when his world was coming down.”Jennifer Jenkins and Mike DeBonis contributed to this report.Graphics by Laura Stanton Wilson Andrews; Video by Sohail Al-Jamea Julio Negron Wilson Andrews Michel du Cille Jayne Orenstein; Editing by Jeff Leen Tim Curran JJ Evans;Design by Chris George Tim Wong; Photo editing and research by Mark Miller Melina Mara Dee Swann Wendy Galietta Nate Grann; Visual editing by Janet Michaud Kat Downs; Project coordination by Greg Linch Tim Richardson; Development by Connor Jennings Tim Wong,1
335,For much to happen in Washington there needs to be a majority or at least a large plurality of voters who trust the notion that Washington activism will have a positive effect. The current scandals combined with President Obama’s lethargy and lack of planning have driven trust in government to a recent new low. This strengthens the hand of those who don’t want anything to pass in Congress. An AP/GFK poll from April 2013 shows that only 21 percent of Americans “trust the government in Washington to do what’s right” either “just about always” or “most” of the time. Senator Marco Rubio recognizes this now-pervasive sentiment referring to “the lack of trust in the federal government and in particular in this administration” when discussing border security concerns in the immigration reform bill.Ironically it’s entirely possible that sequestration will end up being the most consequential piece of legislation that passes in President Obama’s second term. Neither side really wanted it to go into effect and since the consequences are mostly passing unnoticed it’s unlikely that it will be substantially amended.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe president has lost any kind of momentum he may have had coming into his second term and with his administration on the rocks it doesn’t seem likely that he will gain any traction in the coming months.

337,"8 years agoNew York (CNN) – The now-immortalized final moment of Anthony Weiner's failed New York mayoral campaign was the candidate's middle finger directed at a reporter curbside as his car drove away Tuesday night.CNN affiliate NY-1 captured Weiner flipping the bird on video as the candidate departed his primary election night party after delivering his concession speech punctuating the end of his bizarre campaign and an odd evening.Press Weiner security scuffle. Reporter: ""These are the type of people you surround yourself w/ who push us?"" Cue: pic.twitter.com/TAKCKz88xc — Lindsey Christ (@LindseyChrist) September 11 2013If that wasn't enough drama Weiner had trouble getting into his event as Sydney Leathers the woman at the center of the sexting controversy that began the unraveling of his mayoral campaign had shown up outside in what she admitted was a blatant play for media attention. Weiner's problem was there was only one entrance to Connolly's Pub and Restaurant the election night headquarters for his campaign.""I'm here to celebrate. I think he needs some sex therapy"" explained Leathers who is now embracing a career in the porn industry.In Weiner's final days more curiosity than serious candidateDressed in a skintight red dress and platform black pumps Leathers got what she was looking for as some of the press inside headed outside to interview the newly minted porn star. For about 30 minutes it was a media frenzy outside. Leathers stuck around for several hours hoping Weiner would show up even heading inside to the bar to drink a glass of white wine with a male friend.""We went to his campaign headquarters today first and he decided to rearrange his schedule because apparently he doesn't think he can handle confronting me or me being in his presence so I felt like it was only appropriate to make one last stop"" she said.She was right that campaign staff didn't want a scene out front as they spent a long time figuring out how to choreograph Weiner's arrival. When the candidate finally showed just before 11 p.m. he quickly bolted into a next door McDonald's restaurant. The press corps and Leathers gave chase – yes this really happened – security pulled a blocking maneuver as Weiner ducked through a door that connected Connolly's and the Mickey D's.Despite the antics Weiner made no mention of the spectacle outside during his concession speech. But his mood may have been reflected by his departing gesture.- CNN's Laura Dolan Rosa Flores and Tim McCaughan contributed to this report.",1
338,"When Barack Obama unveils his jobs and economic plan to a joint session of Congress on Thursday he'll do so at the lowest point of his presidency according to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.After the bruising debt-ceiling fight — as well as Standard & Poor's subsequent downgrade of the nation's credit rating — Obama's job approval rating has sunk to a low of 44 percent a 3-point drop since July. His handling of the economy stands at a low of 37 percent. And only 19 percent believe the country is headed in the right direction the lowest mark for this president.Perhaps most ominously for Obama a majority of poll takers — 54 percent — think he's facing a longer-term setback from which he's unlikely to recover. Back in January just 39 percent agreed with that assessment.Indeed that 54 percent is virtually identical to George W. Bush's score on the same question in the Nov. 2005 NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll which was released just months after Bush's widely criticized handling of Hurricane Katrina.""When [Obama] addresses the American public he is going to have one more chance to provide some sense of hope and optimism that he ... can provide answers to what is a woeful economy"" said Democratic pollster Peter D. Hart who conducted the survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff.But both Hart and McInturff contend that Obama wasn't the only party damaged by the debt ceiling debacle. A whopping 82 percent now disapprove of the job Congress is doing. In the history of this poll it's an all-time high level of dissatisfaction with Capitol Hill.In addition when asked who is most to blame for the S&P downgrade a plurality points to congressional Republicans. And a majority of respondents say they would vote out every single member of Congress if they could.""Everybody in Washington is taking a substantial hit"" McInturff said.Silver linings for ObamaYet Obama in particular took a gut punch. According to the poll just 42 percent give the president high marks for possessing strong leadership qualities. That’s a 12-point drop from May (in the days following Osama bin Laden’s death).In addition his high marks for being a good commander in chief have plunged 10 points (from 51 percent in May to his current 41 percent rating); his high marks for having the ability to handle a crisis have dropped 14 points (from 53 percent to 39 percent); and his high marks for achieving his goals have declined another 14 points (from 41 percent to 27 percent).If there's a silver lining for Obama it's that a combined 70 percent of respondents still find him likeable (though nearly six in 10 say they disapprove of many of his policies). And 50 percent approve of his handling of foreign policy which Hart says is significant because it suggests that the public doesn't think that everything Obama touches can be viewed negatively.What's more in a hypothetical general election contest Obama leads Texas Gov. Rick Perry by five points 47 percent to 42 percent. And he leads former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney by one 46 percent to 45 percent though that margin is down five points since June.But for the first time in the poll more say they'd probably vote for a generic Republican candidate (44 percent) than say they'd probably vote for Obama (40 percent).""Obama is no longer the favorite to win re-election"" Hart said explaining that a head-to-head score will usually conform to the generic one especially when so many believe the country is headed in the wrong direction.Perry takes commanding GOP leadAnd there's a new favorite in the race for the Republican presidential nomination.Heading into the post-Labor Day sprint and the NBC News/Politico-sponsored debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library on Wednesday Perry is the first choice among 38 percent of GOP voters — followed by Romney at 23 percent Texas Rep. Ron Paul at 9 percent and Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann at 8 percent.Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and ex-Godfather’s Pizza CEO Herman Cain are tied with 5 percent of GOP voters each while former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum gets 3 percent and former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman gets 2 percent.The NBC/WSJ survey is the latest poll to show Perry leading Romney nationally. In recent days Gallup Quinnipiac and CNN have had Perry out in front.On the 'super committee' and 9/11Also this week Congress returns to work and topping the agenda is the start to the 12-member Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction — better known as the “super committee.”In the poll 60 percent say it would be acceptable if the ""super committee"" considers reducing the deficit by ending the so-called Bush tax cuts for families earning $250000 or more per year. Moreover 56 percent say it would be acceptable if it considers reducing the deficit by a combination of tax increases and spending cuts.By comparison just 37 percent believe it’s acceptable for the committee to reduce the deficit by only cutting spending and not raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy. And only 20 percent say it’s acceptable to lower the deficit by reducing spending on Medicare.Finally this Sunday will be the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks. According to the poll 42 percent believe the U.S. is now safer than it was before the attacks — a 9-point increase from Aug. 2010.Thirty-six percent think the U.S. is about as safe as it was before the attacks and 21 percent say it’s less safe.But by more than a 2-to-1 margin respondents maintain that the 9/11 attacks had less of a personal impact to them than the economic recession did.Forty-six percent cited the recession as the event that had the greatest effect on them versus 20 percent who cited the 9/11 attacks.The NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll was conducted of 1000 adults (200 reached by cell phone) from Aug. 27-31 and it has an overall margin of error of plus-minus 3.1 percentage points.Mark Murray covers politics for NBC News.",1
339,This week the Daily Beast contacted and harassed private citizens who made contributions to Sarah Palin’s political action committee SarahPAC. In doing so the outlet attempted to also weaken her organization by smearing it in the eyes of those most responsible for ensuring Palin’s free-market populist message and conservatism is widely disseminated.During the first half of 2013 a political off-year in which there are few elections Palin’s political action committee spent $35000 more than it took in. The Daily Beast seized on that number and tried to convince donors to SarahPAC that Palin was defrauding them by spending money on expenses common to every political action committee.As the Daily Beast conceded Palin’s donors were not buying the Beast’s malarkey.Tim Crawford the treasurer of SarahPAC told Breitbart News that since 2013 is an off-year the organization did not aggressively raise money cognizant of the fact conservative donors were flooded with requests during the 2012 election cycle.“For the most part we gave our donors a break and didn’t fundraise aggressively at all. Very pleased with the results” Crawford told Breitbart News. “It is an off year after a presidential election where every donor was bombarded with requests.”As the Daily Beast mentioned Palin’s PAC did make a $5000 contribution to Jason Smith; the conservative Republican won a special election in Missouri’s Eighth Congressional District in June by a hefty margin 67% to 27%.John Avlon the co-founder of the anti-Tea Party “No Labels” group was recently promoted to be the “Executive Editor” of the Daily Beast. Avlon oversees a publication that declared the Tea Party was dead earlier this year before conceding less than six months later that the movement has roared back to life.“No Labels” donors want to see the Tea Party destroyed and Avlon’s group benefits financially and politically if the Tea Party and conservatives are weakened. Palin coincidentally is the political figure who former South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint said had the most impact in Republican primaries. Furthermore Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) declared at this year’s CPAC that he would not be in the Senate were it not for Palin’s support in the Texas Republican Senate primary.Showing Palin’s strong grassroots support the Daily Beast acknowledges that 75% of SarahPAC’s donations are from “small donors” who contribute less than $200. The Daily Beast admitted they reached out to a “number” of donors and got three on record all of whom dismissed the outlet’s assertion that SarahPAC was wasting their money.One donor said “I trust her judgment and her record.” Another said she has “done research” on Palin’s advisers and the ones that she uses are the “good” ones. Another donor mocked the Daily Beast for insinuating Palin was wasting their money simply telling the reporter “Come on get real.”The publication seems troubled that Palin a figure whose star power is surpassed by few in American politics paid North Star Strategies’s Jason Recher to organize and accompany Palin to events to ensure they went smoothly. To the Daily Beast’s surprise Palin also has advisers like Rebecca Mansour–who is mentioned in the piece–that are indispensable to any political figure especially those like Palin whose time is in demanded like few others.Breitbart News has already systematically undercut Avlon’s assertion that Palin was being hypocritical for railing against Washington’s permanent political class while having political advisers who fight against it. Palin’s advisers are different as Breitbart News reported:They don’t hang “for sale” signs around their necks every election cycle to field a slate of candidates to butter their breads. They don’t go on television shows while not disclosing their business interests or allegiances when attacking other candidates. In fact it is difficult to even think of the last time a Palin staff member actually went on a television program. Again it is because these are people who work for Palin are assembled for the long run and put Palin’s interests ahead of their own. They don’t have a stable or roster of clients.In closing the Daily Beast criticized Palin’s PAC for spending money on hotel rooms so that Palin could give a “commencement speech in the tiny town of Republic Washington.” As Breitbart News reported Palin gave that speech in a town elitist New York outlets like the Daily Beast so often dismiss deride and ignore.The Daily Beast criticized Palin for paying her way–and not forgetting her roots–to speak at the high school graduation in Republic Washington. Perhaps the outlet expected her to walk or drive to give that address. More disturbingly though the outlet harassed and pestered private citizens who donated to her political organization trying to turn them off from supporting a political figure and organization that runs counter to the one co-founded by the Daily Beast’s Executive Editor.That is the type of permanent-political-class politics that Palin and her political action committee have always fought.,1
340,"Martha T. MooreUSA TODAYAnthony Weiner quit Congress after a sexting scandal in 2011Wife says she has forgiven himWeiner says he won%27t drop out of the raceNEW YORK -- Former congressman Anthony Weiner D-N.Y. said he would not quit his race for mayor of New York City despite acknowledging that he continued to send women inappropriate online messages after a sexting scandal forced him to resign from Congress in 2011.""I said that other texts and photos were likely to come out and today they have"" Weiner said in a hastily arranged news conference with his wife by his side. Weiner acknowledged that some of the inappropriate texts were sent after he had resigned.""Some of these things happened before my resignation some of them happened after"" Weiner said.""I'm sure many of my opponents would like me to drop out of the race"" he said but he refused to drop out of the race. After the news conference he went directly to a mayoral candidate forum.""Anthony has made some horrible mistakes both before he resigned from Congress and after"" said Weiner's wife Huma Abedin. ""I love him I have forgiven him I believe in him.""An online gossip site called The Dirty posted screenshots Monday of online messages between an account in the name of Anthony Weiner and that of an unidentified woman. The site said the messages were sent last August more than a year after Weiner left Congress. Weiner discusses her potential involvement in a blog for Politico the political news site and talks about his cats. He also asks the woman to delete other messages they exchanged.A second salacious chat exchange posted by The Dirty was from an account using the name Carlos Danger which the site quoting the unidentified woman says is Weiner.Weiner stepped down from Congress in June 2011 after admitting that he had texted lewd pictures of himself to women reversing previous denials. In May Weiner entered the race for New York City mayor and his wife an aide to former secretary of State Hillary Clinton is campaigning for him. The couple have an 18-month-old son.On Tuesday Weiner said his behavior was ""problematic to say the least and self-destructive to say the most"" but he reminded reporters that he had said at the time that more pictures and messages might be out there. The messages revealed Monday ""don't represent all that much that is new.""Because of the upcoming Sept. 10 Democratic primary ""I'm surprised that more things didn't come out sooner"" he said Tuesday.""While some things that have been posted today are true and some are not there is no question that what I did was wrong"" Weiner said in a written statement. ""This behavior is behind me. I've apologized to Huma and am grateful that she has worked through these issues with me and for her forgiveness. I want to again say that I am very sorry to anyone who was on the receiving end of these messages and the disruption that this has caused. As my wife and I have said we are focused on moving forward.""At the news conference Weiner refused to detail which of the messages were authentic.Sometimes smiling and sometimes near tears the elegantly dressed Abedin a top aide to Hillary Clinton addressed one of the biggest questions of the Weiner story: why she is still married to him. ""It took a lot of work and a whole lot of therapy to get to the point where I could forgive Anthony"" she said.Staying with Weiner ""was not an easy choice in any way"" she said. ""But I made a decision that it was worth staying in this marriage. that was a decision I made for me for our son and for our family. I didn't know how it would work out but I did know that I wanted to give it a try.""George Arzt a New York Democratic political consultant said the new revelations would make Weiner's campaign much harder particularly with former N.Y. governor Eliot Spitzer running for city comptroller after his own sex scandal.""Obviously he has a lot of problems plus the fact that I think that Spitzer has taken a lot of air out of his balloon because they have overlapping aberrant behavior"" Arzt said. ""There is a cumulative impact for the public. They're willing to give anyone a second chance and then they see the repetitive nature of his misdeeds and they say nah I just can't.''Follow @USATMoore on Twitter.",1
341,Beyond the media fawning over the spectacle of President Barack Obama and outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sitting down for an interview together on 60 Minutes–old rivals reunited!–there is a message that the president wants to send. Not just the fact that Vice President Joe Biden will not be his first pick for 2016 but also the signal that Republicans ought to forget about a revival in four years: liberalism is here to stay.Republicans seem to have concluded that their overall revival depends on finding the right candidate to win. If so they may be in for a long wait. Clinton is so popular right now–with Republicans as well as Democrats–that she is easily the favorite to win in 2016. Freshman Rep. Tom Cotton (R-AR) welcomed her during last week’s Benghazi hearings by telling her he had wished her to win the 2008 Democratic primary; even Paul Ryan suggested on Meet the Press that a President Clinton might have solved the debt crisis by now.Clinton’s popularity is partly due to the fact that she is so different to Obama. She is not as hostile to opposition and gives more direct-sounding answers to tough questions even when she is being just as evasive. She once gave the impression of being more centrist as well famously voting in 2002 to authorize the Iraq War–a vote that her rival punished her for on the campaign trail in 2008 claiming he would have voted differently.In truth there is not much daylight between the Alinskyite pair. Clinton not only carried out the Obama administration’s awful foreign policy–she did so with enthusiasm. She lectured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for 45 minutes over construction in Jewish parts of Jerusalem for example and launched an abortive “reset” in relations with Russia (a gesture that failed even in its theatrics; the button read “overcharge”).Obama and Clinton are also closely bound together in the Benghazi failure a scandal whose details are still being kept from the public even though it is broadly clear that the White House chose not to intervene to save U.S. personnel and at the same time engineered a cover-up in which both Obama and Clinton agreed to a fraudulent alibi that blamed the deadly attack on an anti-Islam video on YouTube that few had seen.Yet the two have avoided accountability since the media failed to pursue the Benghazi scandal before the election (or actively suppressed it) and now that the election is long gone most have adopted the “what difference does it make?” attitude displayed by Clinton on Capitol Hill last week. She ought to be haunted by those words and those four dead Americans for the rest of her career; chances are however that she will not.Obama’s joint interview was likely planned as a gesture of support and unity as the Benghazi scandal returned–however briefly–to the headlines. Yet it also serves a political purpose for the president as he moves forward with an aggressive and confrontational agenda designed to divide and marginalize opposition and lay the foundation for radical changes not just for the next four years but the in years beyond.President Obama wants Republicans to know that the left’s moment is not fleeting; that the changes he makes today will be ratified by the electorate through Clinton in 2016 and possibly 2020; in short that there is no hope for a resurgence and they may as well yield. Whether he succeeds may depend less on how Republicans rebuild themselves and more on whether Biden–and other Democrats–disrupt the Obama-Clinton alliance.,1
342,"IN THE NEWS: U.S. opens criminal probe of IRS … Holder recused self on AP phone search … E-mail leak on Benghazi led to erroneous reporting … Russia accuses U.S. diplomat of spying … Pentagon announces furloughs for 680K ... Can loneliness kill you?THE TAKEHillary’s Ties to Obama Could Cost HerSome Republicans believe revelations about Benghazi could raise questions about Hillary Clinton’s stewardship at the State Department. But for Clinton the general tenor of scandal that has suffused the administration could cost her more.If the media focus shifts from Obama’s second-term legacy to second-term scandals it could cast a pall over those looking to capitalize on his coattails.Clinton knows all too well about the public’s desire for change both from her own presidential race and the conclusion of her husband’s second term. Public dissatisfaction with George W. Bush sent Democratic voters looking for someone with less time in Washington and disconnected from the war in Iraq. Nearly a decade earlier then-Vice President Al Gore awkwardly tried to distance himself from his former boss after Bill Clinton’s sex scandal despite voters’ widespread approval of Clinton’s policies.By connecting herself to Obama so closely—most recently with a joint sitdown on 60 Minutes—Clinton hoped to benefit from Obama’s strong popularity among Democrats. Now there’s a very real chance that the rewards of that loyalty could dissipate.Josh Kraushaarjkraushaar@nationaljournal.comTOP NEWSIRS TARGETING NOT RESTRICTED TO FIELD OFFICE.

Loneliness can increase your likelihood of sickness and even death The New Republic reports. Loneliness is not being frequently alone nor does it mean someone who has few friends is lonely. Loneliness is a “want of intimacy” and an “interior” experience. The cause of loneliness is combination of genes and environment. “Although genes may predispose children toward loneliness they do not account for everything that makes them grow up lonely. Fifty-two percent of that comes from the world.”Some have pushed back against the idea that the feeling of loneliness can cause health problems arguing rather that it’s the symptoms of loneliness. For example lonely people lack a support network or someone who will look out for them and therefore get sick more often.

343,"A jury in South Bend Indiana has found that fraud put President Obama and Hillary Clinton on the presidential primary ballot in Indiana in the 2008 election. Two Democratic political operatives were convicted Thursday night in the illegal scheme after only three hours of deliberations. They were found guilty on all counts.Former longtime St. Joseph County Democratic party Chairman Butch Morgan Jr. was found guilty of felony conspiracy counts to commit petition fraud and forgery and former county Board of Elections worker Dustin Blythe was found guilty of felony forgery counts and falsely making a petition after being accused of faking petitions that enabled Obama then an Illinois Senator to get on the presidential primary ballot for his first run for the White House.Morgan was accused of being the mastermind behind the plot.According to testimony from two former Board of Election officials who pled guilty Morgan ordered Democratic officials and workers to fake the names and signatures that Obama and Clinton needed to qualify for the presidential race. Blythe then a Board of Elections employee and Democratic Party volunteer was accused of forging multiple pages of the Obama petitions.""I think this helped uphold the integrity of the electoral system"" the prosecutor Stan Levco told reporters.More On This... Trial begins for officials accused in Obama Clinton ballot petition fraud“Their verdict of guilt is not a verdict against Democrats but for honest and fair elections” he said.The scheme was hatched in January of 2008 according to affidavits from investigators who cite former Board of Registration worker Lucas Burkett who told them he was in on the plan at first but then became uneasy and quit. He waited three years before telling authorities about it but if revelations about any forgeries were raised during the election the petitions could have been challenged during the contest. A candidate who did not qualify with enough legitimate signatures at the time could have been bounced from the ballot.The case raise questions about whether in 2008 then candidate Obama actually submitted enough legitimate signatures to have legally qualified for the primary ballot.“I think had they been challenged successfully he probably would not have been on the ballot” Levco told Fox News.Under state law presidential candidates need to qualify for the primary ballots with 500 signatures from each of the state's nine congressional districts. Indiana election officials say that in St. Joseph County which is the 2nd Congressional district the Obama campaign qualified with 534 signatures; Clinton's camp had 704.Prosecutors say that in President Obama's case nine of the petition pages were apparently forged. Each petition contains up to 10 names making a possible total of 90 names which if faked could have brought the Obama total below the legal limit required to qualify. Prosecutors say 13 Clinton petitions were apparently forged meaning up to 130 possibly fake signatures. Even if 130 signatures had been challenged it would have still left Mrs. Clinton with enough signatures to meet the 500 person threshold.Levco said a total of “100 to 200” signatures had been forged on Obama’s and Clinton’s petitions.An Indiana State Police investigator said in court papers that the agency examined the suspect Obama petitions and ""selected names at random from each of the petition pages and contacted those people directly. We found at least one person (and often multiple people) from each page who confirmed that they had not signed"" petitions ""or given consent for their name and/or signature to appear.""Numerous voters told Fox News that they never signed the petitions.""That's not my signature"" Charity Rorie a mother of four told us when we showed her the Obama petition with her name and signature. She was stunned saying that it ""absolutely"" was a fake.Charity told Fox News that her husband's entry was also a forgery and that they have never been contacted by investigators or any authorities looking into the scandal.""It's scary it's shocking. It definitely is illegal"" she told us.Robert Hunter Jr. told Fox news that his name was faked too.""I did not sign for Barack Obama"" he told us. As he examined the Obama petition in his hands Hunter pointed out that ""I always put 'Junior' after my name every time...there's no 'Junior' thereEven a former Democratic Governor of Indiana Joe Kernan told Fox News that his name was forged.“This is a bitter sweet moment for free and fair elections"" observed Ryan Nees the Indiana born Yale “University senior who first exposed the scheme in the independent political newsletter Howey Politics Indiana and South Bend Tribune.Nees said the multiple guilty verdicts were ""bitter because a five-person conspiracy succeeded in illegally placing two presidential candidates on the ballot but sweet because they were exposed tried for their crimes and convicted.""Nees previously told Fox News that the fraud was clearly evident ""because page after page of signatures are all in the same handwriting"" and that nobody raised any red flags ""because election workers in charge of verifying their validity were the same people faking the signatures.""Fox News' Meredith Amor contributed to this report.",1

345,"There's an irony in the Internal Revenue Service's crackdown on conservative groups.The nation's tax agency has admitted to inappropriately scrutinizing smaller tea party organizations that applied for tax-exempt status and senior Treasury Department officials were notified in the midst of the 2012 presidential election season that an internal investigation was underway. But the IRS largely maintained a hands-off policy with the much larger big-budget organizations on the left and right that were most influential in the elections and are organized under a section of the tax code that allows them to hide their donors.""The IRS goes AWOL when wealthy and powerful forces want to break the law in order to hide their wrongful efforts and secret political influence"" said Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse a Democrat who is among a small Senate group pushing campaign finance reform measures that would force these big outside groups to disclose their donors. ""Picking on the little guy is a pretty lousy thing to do.""Karl Rove's Crossroads GPS and the Koch brothers' Americans for Prosperity were among those that spent tens of millions of dollars on TV ads and get-out-the-vote efforts to help Republicans. Democrats were aided in similar fashion by Priorities USA made up of former Barack Obama campaign aides and American Bridge 21st Century Foundation an opposition research group led by a former adviser to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.And yet those groups so far have escaped investigations into whether they have crossed the blurry line under the law between what constitutes a tax-exempt ""social welfare"" organization that is free from donor reporting requirements and a political committee subject to taxes and disclosures.Watchdog groups and lawmakers who have sought more disclosure and restrictions on such groups claim an injustice. They say the IRS saga over the targeting of smaller groups shines a bright light onto the agency's failure to guard against the flood of secret money into the political system through the creation of the deep-pocketed groups.Yet other advocates of reform worry that in light of the IRS disclosure of targeting small groups government regulators will be less likely to scrutinize the tax-exempt status of the bigger more powerful groups out of fear that they will appear to be targeting groups for political reasons.""We expect that opponents of disclosure will try to use the recent developments to allow the groups that are misusing the tax laws to hide donors to continue misusing them. But that's a battle that we will engage in"" said Fred Wertheimer founder and president of watchdog group Democracy 21.Since a series of court decisions including the Supreme Court's ruling in the 2010 Citizens United case the IRS has seen an influx of applications -- from 1735 in 2010 to 3357 in 2012 -- by so-called social welfare groups wanting to form under section 501(c)(4) of the federal tax code. That section grants tax-exempt status as long as the primary mission of these organizations is not politics and influencing elections. The IRS makes that determination. Such nonprofits can keep secret the names of their donors which are not subject to traditional campaign finance limits.The rules are fuzzy. The law says that these groups can only be involved in social welfare activity and not politics. But IRS regulations give the groups leeway to conduct political activities -- as long as that is not its ""primary activity."" That conflict opens the door to potential abuses and different interpretations of what is allowed and what is prohibited.An IRS inspector general's report released this week recommended developing for the first time specific guidelines to measure the primary activity of social welfare organizations and some in Congress have shown a willingness to review big groups like the nonprofit Crossroads GPS and its sister super PAC American Crossroads. They spent a combined $176 million in the last election cycle much of it on television advertisements to benefit Republican candidates.A Senate investigative panel led by Democrat Carl Levin of Michigan and Republican John McCain of Arizona has been reviewing the use of social welfare groups for political causes for the past year and now is examining the agency's handling of the tax-exempt reviews.And in a letter to congressional investigators Thursday Rep. Chris Van Hollen D-Md. urged the House Ways and Means Committee not to ignore the influx of groups that may be abusing the tax code as part of its upcoming IRS probe saying: ""I hope we can remove the incentive for any group regardless of its political orientation to seek 501(c)(4) tax-exempt status to engage in significant political campaign activities while hiding their donors.""Despite the bipartisan outcry over the IRS scandal there's little incentive for lawmakers on either side of the aisle to push for reforms because Republicans and Democrats alike benefit from these big outside groups.In fact just the opposite may be happening.Some congressional Democrats fearful of being tied to the scandal are backing the push for more aggressive enforcement of these groups. And some conservative leaders and Republican donors are using the IRS scandal to help protect the status quo while preparing to pump hundreds of millions of dollars -- raised anonymously in many cases with no contribution limits -- into the next election cycle just as they did last fall.""I would hope that this new information about the politicization of the IRS should put the brakes on any sort of disclosure of donors who wish to remain anonymous"" said Charlie Spies who helps raise money for several conservative organizations and previously led the super political action committee that raised more than $140 million to benefit Mitt Romney's presidential bid. ""We're now seeing exactly what the risk is for donors to be disclosed.""At least some tea party groups are unwilling to trust the agency with more enforcement power in the wake of such damaging revelations.""The IRS' integrity is shattered"" said Jenny Beth Martin chairman of the Tea Party Patriots which was among the largest nonprofit conservative groups the IRS targeted. She said that now more than ever donors need freedom to give money anonymously ""without fear of retribution"" from a politicized IRS. In the meantime she says her organization's influence is growing fueled by anonymous unlimited donations.Wertheimer of Democracy 21 said the ""laundering of secret money into elections"" will become a greater scandal than IRS misconduct unless something is done.""There will be efforts to sweep this under the rug"" he said. ""They may succeed on a temporary basis for a relatively short period but they are not going to succeed in the long term.""",0
346,To the dismay of liberals and right-wing immigration reform opponents (both rooting for failure) Speaker John Boehner (Ohio) promised that immigration reform was coming. The House has already done its work in passing Iran sanctions intelligence reauthorization and a variety of economic and energy-related bills as his staff was delighted to point out. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) is reportedly narrowing in on a budget deal with modest spending cuts and some discrete trades for sequestration relief (thereby allowing some much-needed defense spending but keeping the spending straitjacket in place with no tax hikes). The back-benchers seem to have been tamed if not charmed.In fact Boehner somehow managed to come through the shutdown fight in better standing with his caucus than when he went in. Intentional or not his loose reins allowed the back-benchers to blow off steam and frankly embarrass themselves. Most of the caucus now seems ready for business.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe Senate meanwhile is a mess. Majority Leader Harry Reid pulled the trigger on the “nuclear option” which many liberals are already regretting and which will make it hard to do anything of note in that body. He has potentially transformed the political landscape which is likely to result in even rockier and more partisan politics in the year ahead. The Senate has yet to pass a defense reauthorization act. Iran sanctions will have to wait until December. The sole achievement is an immigration reform bill so large and cumbersome that even the president is amenable to breaking it up and following the House’s demand for a series of separate bills.And worst of all Reid has bottled up Obamacare “fix” legislation desperately needed by imperiled red-state Democrats trying to shield themselves from the health-care debacle. As seen in falling poll numbers for a number of Democrats up in 2014 Reid may be a year away from turning over the gavel to Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and a band of aggrieved Republicans with every intention of using new filibuster rules to their advantage.I have wondered for several months: What are the Democrats supposed to run on in 2014?AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementVoted for Obamacare but didn’t know what was in it.

No one really doubts that Reid and Obama would cook up two years of big government legislation like we saw in the first two years of the Obama presidency tax hikes and a bevy of appointments of extreme and marginally qualified people whom the GOP would be powerless to stop.,1

The obvious insinuation is that the overweight governor crushes her during sex:Two days after Election Day Chris Christie has crushed his opponent. Is he gonna be the Republican …” began McGrath.“The one I feel for is his wife” Matthews cut in.After a brief pause some chuckled as McGrath asked “Why’s that?”“Did you just say ‘crush?'” Matthews said. “I mean use your imagination.”The crowd erupted.This is not the first time Matthews has publicly mocked Christie’s weight:Matthews said during a “Q & A Cafe” event two years ago with Carol Joynt “He must be 300-plus and that’s something he’s just gotta deal with because you’re not going to say ‘I’m going to cut the budget’ well how about starting with supper?”In their efforts to undermine a likely GOP presidential candidate the mainstream media have taken issue with Christie’s weight in various ways ranging from cheap shots to scare tactics. Earlier this week Time Magazine declared Christie the “elephant in the room” on its cover. Earlier this year CNN’s Jim Acosta warned Americans that Christie could die in the Oval Office.It is also no coincidence that Politico piled on today with a “serious” piece examining Christie’s weight.The media love Christie when he is hugging Barack Obama and trashing conservatives. But the media also know that he is about to threaten Hillary Clinton’s ascension to the White House. By laying the groundwork with the weight issue now the media hope to turn Christie into a national fat joke as a way to undermine his candidacy.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC,1
349,"When Michele Bachmann picked on Huma Abedin a year ago — claiming she had some convoluted connection to the Muslim Brotherhood — there was a rush to defend the longtime Hillary Clinton aide. The Minnesota congresswoman quickly got a scolding from House Speaker John Boehner Sen. John McCain House Intelligence Committee chair Mile Rogers. But now that her husband Anthony Weiner is running for New York City mayor the attacks on Abedin aren't so ridiculous and Abedin herself is not quite so untouchable. Sen. Chuck Grassley is continuing his investigation into Abedin's unusual arrangement from June 2012 to February 2013 to work part-time as a consultant to the State Department while working as a consultant to Teneo Holdings a New York-based strategic advisory group the New York Daily News' Dan Friedman reports.RELATED: Anthony Weiner May Think He's Closer Friends with the Clintons Than They DoGrassley claims Abedin is stonewalling his investigation into whether she used her government connections to give information to Teneo clients. Abedin didn't respond to Grassley's June letter until July 5 when the Daily News reported her silence. ""I certainly never 'gathered information from government sources for the purpose of informing investment decisions of Teneo's clients' as the Senate letter suggests"" Abedin wrote. Grassley responds that ""The State Department and Ms. Abedin haven't provided a single document that I requested."" He says he'll keep pursuing his probe.RELATED: What Did Huma Abedin Really Learn from Hillary Clinton?And while there has been much praise of Abedin's handling of her first press conference this week after it was reported that Weiner sent crotch pictures to other women more than a year after he resigned from Congress she doesn't quite have the halo she once did. Slate's Dave Weigel points out that six years of news coverage of Abedin has remarkably focused on rave reviews of her physical appearance. (""Her appearance is just like ‘Hoh my God!’ She takes your breath away"" James Carville said. ""[T]he women in our office definitely watch what Huma wears"" Philippe Reines who later worked as Clinton's spokesman said.) The two main non-fashion things she's known for — standing by her husband and cashing in on Washington connections — are pretty ""ordinary"" Weigel says.Story continuesRELATED: Huma Abedin Will Not Have Trouble Finding Her Next JobIt's in the latter category that Abedin still shines. As The Washington Post reported on Thursday friends of Bill and Hillary Clinton generally felt that ""if you wanted to stay in Hillary’s good graces you answer the call from Huma."" So they donated to Weiner's mayoral campaign. And they still are! At least as long as Abedin sticks by him the New York Post reports:“If you look at the contributors to Anthony around the country they weren’t giving for Anthony — they were giving for Huma” the source said. “For many people Huma is the gateway to Hillary. She’s one of the closest aides; she’s an adopted daughter. You think [power agent] Bob Barnett would give to Anthony? [Billionaire] Haim Saban wouldn’t give Anthony a second chance.”But Clinton's biggest donors haven't bothered with Weiner the Post says. That's because they ties to Hillary are already close enough.",1

352,On Saturday the New York Times reported that Organizing for Action–the Obama for America presidential campaign structure recently re-organized as a 501 c 4 tax-exempt “issues advocacy” non-profit–is offering access to President Obama to any donors (individuals or corporations) who contribute $500000 to the group. According to the Times such contributions place “donors on a national advisory board for Mr. Obama’s group and [gives them] the privilege of attending quarterly meetings with the president along with other meetings at the White House.”The Obama team’s brazen attempt to convert the assets of its political campaign into assets to promote the President’s political agenda and the electoral fortunes of his Democratic allies is unprecedented in American political history. It is clearly a violation of the intent of current federal election laws.The Obama team is betting that they’ve cleverly discovered a loophole one that Republicans will fail to challenge legally. Even if the legality of this unprecedented and highly political attempt to circumvent the intent of federal election law is challenged Obama’s team is further betting that their attorneys will argue their case successfully before regulators and judges. To date the Obama tactic has caught Republicans flat footed.Not only is the conversion of questionable legality it also is in absolute contradiction to everything President Obama has ever said about the negative influence of large financial donations on the political process in America. In 2010 for instance when the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision paved the way for SuperPACs that could accept unlimited donations from individuals and corporations alike President Obama was one of the Court’s harshest critics. But the President’s opinion on the evils of unlimited donations to political organizations–especially those that pretend to be “issues advocacy” groups–appears to have changed in the three years since that decision.The expensive and valuable assets of Obama for America were quickly made available to Organizing for Action which has already begun to use them extensively in Obama’s “permanent campaign” hosting State of the Union listening parties and bombarding the internet with pro gun control emails. It is unclear if the new Organizing for Action entity has paid fair market value–or anything at all for that matter–to the old Obama for America organization for these assets.The assets include a sophisticated state-of-the-art analytics driven data base that holds extensive information on each of 2 million Obama for America volunteers 17 million email subscribers 22 million Twitter followers and virtually every registered voter in the country. These assets will deployed by the same management team that ran Obama for America headed up by former campaign manager Jim Messina. At Organizing for Action Messina will use the technological infrastructure developed over several years at Obama for America to instantaneously deliver communications in multiple formats (email text facebook tweets) using the same methodology to the same vast audience that received those very similar messages during President Obama’s presidential campaigns.“Issues advocacy” social welfare non-profit groups organized under Section 501 c 4 of the Internal Revenue Service code which Organizing for Action claims to be are not subject to the same federal election laws that prohibit corporate donations and limit individual contributions to political candidates to $2600 per election. In its new iteration the organization that was until January 17 2013 known as Obama for America and was governed by these strict campaign laws can now accept unlimited donations from both corporations and individuals. Better yet it is not required to publicly disclose the names of these donors.All this is happening while the Organizing for Action management team–and the Obama administration–are pretending and saying out loud with a straight face that it is not a political organization. In reality it is nothing but a political organization and its immediate purpose is to advance the President’s second term agenda and defeat Republican House and Senate candidates in 2014. With that accomplished and Democrats in control of both the House and Senate there will be nothing to stop President Obama and his radical left wing agenda.Even MSNBC’s Chuck Todd found the cash for access scheme unpalatable. “This just looks bad” Todd said on Monday. “It looks” Todd said “like the White House is selling access.It’s the definition of selling access. If you believe money has a strangle hold over the entire political system this is ceding the moral high ground.”Todd is right. It looks bad because it is bad.Bob Edgar the president of the usually liberal advocacy group Common Cause agrees with Todd. “It just smells. The president is setting a very bad model setting up this organization”he said.White House press secretary Jay Carney tried to sell the administration line that Organizing for Action is just like any other 501 c 4 and this sort of thing is done all the time to the usually compliant White House press corps on Monday but most of them could barely withhold their incredulity at Carney’s claims. Indeed Carney became so frustrated at their skepticism that he abruptly curtailed the normal press briefing and walked off unceremoniously as unanswered questioned were left hanging in the air.,1
353,"Gregory KorteUSA TODAYIRS list obtained by USA TODAY reveals names of 162 groups scrutinized by tax agencyMore than 80%25 of groups on the list were affiliated with the Tea Party or other conservative causesIRS also questioned political activities of progressive and centrist groupsCorrection: An earlier version of this story understated the number of groups represented by the the American Center for Law and Justice.WASHINGTON — Newly uncovered IRS documents show the agency flagged political groups based on the content of their literature raising concerns specifically about ""anti-Obama rhetoric"" inflammatory language and ""emotional"" statements made by non-profits seeking tax-exempt status.The internal 2011 documents obtained by USA TODAY list 162 groups by name with comments by Internal Revenue Service lawyers in Washington raising issues about their political lobbying and advocacy activities. In 21 cases those activities were characterized as ""propaganda.""The list provides the most specific public accounting to date of which groups were targeted for extra scrutiny and why. The IRS has not publicly identified the groups repeatedly citing a provision of the tax code prohibiting it from releasing tax return information.More than 80% of the organizations on the 2011 ""political advocacy case"" list were conservative but the effort to police political activity also ensnared at least 11 liberal groups as of November 2011 including Progressives United Progress Texas and Delawareans for Social and Economic Justice.The IRS controversy first exploded in May when Exempt Organizations Director Lois Lerner admitted that the IRS had targeted Tea Party groups for additional scrutiny beginning in early 2010. The IRS placed a hold on those applications for more than 20 months an inspector general's investigation found.On Nov. 16 2011 IRS lawyers in Washington sent a list of cases to front-line agents in Cincinnati along with comments and guidance on how to handle political organizations.Tax law experts say those comments appear to show IRS employees trying to apply the murky rules governing political activities by social welfare groups.But the American Center for Law and Justice a nonprofit legal institute that represents 33 of the groups appearing on the IRS list said it appears to be ""the most powerful evidence yet of a coordinated effort"" by the IRS to target Tea Party groups.""The political motivations of this are so patently obvious but then to have a document that spells it out like this is very damaging to the IRS"" said Jay Sekulow chief counsel for the ACLJ. ""I hope the FBI has seen these documents.""The IRS categorized the groups as engaging in several advocacy-related activities that could have barred them from tax-exempt status such as lobbying and ""propaganda.""But the word ""propaganda"" doesn't appear in section 501(c)(4) which governs the social welfare status that most Tea Party groups were applying for said John Colombo a law professor at the University of Illinois. Instead it appears in section 501(c)(3) which governs public charities.""There would be no reason I would think to flag them if it's for a 501(c)(4) status"" Colombo said. ""That's very odd to me.""In three cases IRS lawyers noted that groups appeared to be connected to Republican politicians: Stand Up for Our Nation Inc. linked to former Alaska governor Sarah Palin; Reform Jersey Now Inc. linked to Gov. Chris Christie; and American Solutions for Winning the Future founded by former House speaker Newt Gingrich. Gingrich's group was approved last year.Five groups were flagged as having ""anti-Obama"" materials in their applications or on their websites.For instance the IRS said the website of the Patriots of Charleston contains ""negative Obama commentary."" Though the IRS didn't cite examples a November 2011 article on the group's site says: ""Obama's and the Democrats' track record of disaster is based upon a combination of their ignorance and their fundamental desire to convert America into a ruling class of wealthy all-powerful elitists and a single class of serfs.""""The web site as we explained to them on multiple occasions is really a blog"" that members can submit commentary to said Joanne Jones the group's vice chairwoman. ""I'm not going to tell you we weren't political. We were to an extent but we were within the limits of the law. For example there's one clear-cut issue: We did not endorse candidates.""""To focus in on somebody saying something anti-Obama"" she said ""it's almost like the speech police there. It's disturbing. It's the kind of overreach that leads into Obamacare.""The group received its tax exemption in September 2012.RHETORIC OF SOME GROUPS QUESTIONEDIt wasn't just anti-Obama rhetoric the IRS was looking out for. Progress Texas was identified by the IRS as engaging in lobbying propaganda and political activities. IRS lawyers in Washington noted ""anti-Rick Perry"" rhetoric referring to the Republican Texas governor then a presidential candidate.Progress Texas received a tax exemption as a social welfare group in June 2012.Campaign-finance watchdogs say the IRS scrutiny came out of a justified effort to police ""dark money"" in politics. After the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that corporations and unions — and even non-profit groups — could engage in independent political advertising social welfare groups became a vehicle for funneling undisclosed cash into the election system.That's the position of Progressives United a group founded by former senator Russ Feingold D-Wis. that itself appeared on the 2011 IRS target list.""The fact that our group received some scrutiny does not change at all our opinion that scrutiny like this from the IRS it's their job. The law applies to us as it would any conservative group"" said Progressives United's Josh Orton. ""I feel like there's this group of campaign finance nihilists who want to expand this into an argument that there should be no scrutiny at all. They want a wild west of election law because they want to continue using secret corporate money to influence elections.""Crossroads GPS a group affiliated with GOP strategist Karl Rove spent $70 million on the 2012 election. Its 2010 application for a tax exemption obtained by the non-profit news organization Pro Publica last year said it would spend 50% of its resources on ""public education."" In the 2011 list the IRS noted ""significant anti-Obama rhetoric."" Crossroads has not received a tax exemption.'WE ARE TOTALLY ABOVE BOARD'The Tea Party of North Idaho filed its tax-exempt application in February 2010 — the same month IRS screeners in Cincinnati first brought Tea Party applications to the attention of officials in Washington according to IRS employee testimony before a congressional committee.A lawyer in the IRS Exempt Organizations Technical Unit in Washington wrote the Idaho group had ""No significant amount of clear campaign intervention; however little issue advocacy or educational; significant inflammatory language highly emotional language little to no educational information on issues.""The IRS lawyers recommended that screeners in Cincinnati look for other materials — including ""press releases commentary articles and research reports"" according to the IRS list.That's when Leslie Damiano who co-founded the North Idaho group started getting what she considered to be intrusive questions from the IRS. She said the tax agency wanted to know who her donors were and what companies they own. They wanted to know the educational background of the group's board members. And they wanted to know whether candidates were invited to the group's meetings and whether it made endorsements.""We're a conservative organization. We invited some independents"" she said. ""We never had any rallies that were off the charts by any stretch of the imagination.""Frustrated with the process the Tea Party of North Idaho withdrew its application in 2012.""We had an accountant we had a bookkeeper. We were totally above board with everything we did"" Damiano said.REDUCING THE NATIONAL DEBTSome groups caught in the IRS' net had no connection to national politics on either side. The Citizens for the Preservation of Rural Murrysville says it's ""dedicated to the preservation of the open and natural rural character of Murrysville Pa."" although the IRS said it endorsed some local candidates. The Sarasota Bay Tiger Club is one of several similar Florida clubs that provide ""a non-partisan forum on current political issues."" The club says it has ""never endorsed political candidates nor advocated a particular ideology"" but the IRS said in its spreadsheet that it was ""unclear"" if that was the case.The list also includes the Association to Reduce the National Debt which was seeking to be recognized as a charity so it could solicit tax-deductible contributions — and give those contributions to the U.S. Treasury to put toward the national debt.Founder Seth Eisenberg said the group was not political — and he told the IRS that.IRS tax specialists noted ""no political campaign activities."" But two years after applying the association still hasn't gotten his ruling letter. And without that letter contributions are not tax-deductible and no one will give he said.All for a group that said it wanted to give the government money.""I thought this would be a fast-tracked application. A no-brainer. But it got caught up in this whole political controversy"" Eisenberg said. ""It's the greatest irony that ever was.""Follow @gregorykorte on Twitter.",1
354,"America has gone puritanically insane. To be sure many will claim it is not the salaciousness of the pictures and graphically sexual tweets of Carlos Danger (Anthony Weiner’s Twitter name) that is driving this story. Many will say that it is the lies about his online behavior that keeps this story in the 24/7 news lineup. That is simply hogwash. America is a country that has been trained to be sexually puritanical in discourse while sexually liberal behind closed doors or by implication in music videos and movies.This applies to the common man and politicians alike. Most by now are aware that from FDR to Kennedy sexual escapades were common. In the case of President Clinton those that verbally attacked him for the Monica Lewinsky ""sex scandal"" were themselves guilty of similar or worst sexual escapades (puritanical in condemnation while sexually liberal).It is unsettling that the New York Times thought it had the right to suggest that Anthony Weiner leave the mayoral race inasmuch as they never suggested that Giuliani or Clinton resign for their ""sexual misdeeds."" What is even more disconcerting is the mainstream media’s 24/7obsession with the story. Their righteous indignation for what is so far a fantasy; a virtual sexual affair as they probe with psychological analysis moral analysis with a dose of excoriation is uncalled for.The media would do much better if they had concentrated on Wiener's fitness to be mayor based on his qualifications relative to other mayors. Does he display the passion and political knowledge to be the head of a city of over 8 million people? Is any other mayoral candidate more qualified? Judging Weiner based on his discovered sexual proclivities while not doing so for all the other candidates is reason enough to stick with only his qualifications.The reality is that there is a real scandal. The real scandal isn’t about Weiner however. It is about a derelict mainstream media. While an excessive amount of time is being spent on a virtual sexual scandal there are many issues that materially affect the working middle class that go unreported.More on Anthony Weiner and the New York City mayoral race below the fold.",1
355,Arizona is once again embroiled in a fight against the federal government at the Supreme Court of the United States. The Court heard arguments on Mar. 18 in Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona.In earlier years people had to go to their county seat of government–typically the county courthouse–to register to vote in a system that made it very difficult to commit voter registration fraud. A federal commission is authorized by the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA or “Motor Voter”) which was pushed and signed by Bill Clinton to develop a federal form for mail-in registration.Arizona passed a law requiring people registering to vote by mail to include proof of citizenship. It was designed as a modest attempt to prevent illegal voting by foreigners that could undermine the legitimacy of the election returns in the democratic process.The record in this case includes over 200 people who had submitted fraudulent voter registrations who later swore under oath to a commission investigating this matter that they were not even U.S. citizens. They say workers from groups like the now-defunct ACORN–who were getting paid for each registration form they turned in–talked them into signing it and that these individuals did not know it was a crime for them to do so.NVRA requires states to “accept and use” the federal form. Arizona argues it accepts and uses the form and that adding the requirement for someone to attach proof of citizenship is allowed. The plaintiffs and the Obama administration argue that if you add anything to the federal requirements you are not accepting and using the federal form. This case will turn in part on which side the justices take on that issue.Usually when federal law conflicts with state law it is resolved under the Supremacy Clause in Article VI of the Constitution whereby federal law trumps state law under certain circumstances. Instead of the Supremacy Clause this case will be decided under the Elections Clause in Article I of the Constitution. That provision says that states are primarily in charge of voting and elections but “Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations …”There is a large body of Supreme Court precedent interpreting the Supremacy Clause. This case may turn on whether the Elections Clause works by the same rules or instead if there is a different framework that determines when federal election law trumps state election law.It is unclear which way this case will go with some justices sending signals one way or the other.Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said “Congress did specify how citizenship was to be handled. And it was to be [signing the form where you declare you are a citizen under] penalty of perjury.” She added she understands NVRA as saying “each state must accept and use the federal form period. That’s the end of it.”Justice Antonin Scalia seemed to fault Arizona for not making certain claims earlier in the litigation. But Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne explained that this lawsuit began under his predecessor Terry Goddard who is a Democrat and that Horne did not know why Goddard did not think to use a different strategy.Scalia also seemed sympathetic to Arizona’s argument. For example he remarked that the federal form requires nothing to show the individual is a citizen except “check off ‘I am a citizen’ right? So it’s under oath. Big deal. If you’re willing to violate the voting laws I suppose you’re willing to violate the perjury laws.”Going into yesterday’s argument it was possible that two justices Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy were swing votes in this case. We should find out by late June which side prevailed.Breitbart News legal columnist Ken Klukowski is a fellow with the American Civil Rights Union.,1
356,"“The greatest danger zone a president can be in is when he is being attacked on the left and the right. When they are reading off the same talking points that’s when presidencies fall apart.”-- Dan Pfeiffer senior adviser to President Obama in an interview with the Washington Post.In the little that President Obama has said publicly about his administration’s recently exposed domestic surveillance programs he has returned to the overall motif of his presidency: warning against excessive distrust of the federal government.While hawks wait anxiously to see if Obama can summon the political courage to defend the programs he has expanded despite his onetime opposition the president has so far used the occasion to preach against what he seems to believe is a virus of anti-government sentiment in the nation.(At this moment it appears more likely that Obama will mostly leave it to Republicans to defend his programs as he and they did with his war in Afghanistan and his flying killer robots. But who knows? The stakes are so huge here that even Obama may not be immune to political risk taking.)More On This...Obama’s commencement speech this year at Ohio State his 2011 reprise of fellow liberal icon Theodore Roosevelt’s “New Nationalism” speech and many others particularly his off-the-cuff comments on those who “get bitter and cling…” have been musings on the theme that the deep distrust of government in the United States is not just harmful but artificial – that moneyed corporate interests are behind these sentiments.Obama’s argument in concentrate is that rich people play on the fears and prejudices of the working class in order to block government from fulfilling its rightful role as regulator and protector. This is a particularly unhappy view of the condition of the American experiment arguing as it does that the majority of the citizenry has been bamboozled into mistrusting their own protector.Whatever the dark impulses and manipulations Obama believes lay at the heart of American disdain for government the effect is that the president does not often deign to honestly engage the critics of his agenda and worldview. If he thinks that the Koch Brothers and Exxon lurk behind every critic of big powerful government (apparently a view shared by many in the IRS) why would Obama give them the time of day?If they are not as the president says “on the level” why indulge them and allow them to distract from his goal of reorganizing the community of the disenfranchised around the banner of “collective action?”As scandals and misdeeds rack his administration though Obama is paying a high price for his cynicism as Americans return the favor.Just flip through the results of the latest FOX News poll:[pullquote]-- 56 percent of voters believe Obama did not try to rescue the doomed garrison in Benghazi Libya because he didn’t want to risk his re-election.-- 62 percent agree that Obama’s NSA phone surveillance constitutes “an unacceptable and alarming invasion of privacy rights.”-- 63 percent believe that Obama’s Justice Department seized reporter’s records for political reasons compared to 29 percent who take the administration’s national security argument to be true.-- 68 percent believe that the White House isn’t telling the truth about the targeting of the president’s political enemies by the IRS. Just 24 percent believe the White House line that Team Obama neither directed nor was aware of the targeting.-- 74 percent said that when it comes to openness and transparency the Obama administration is either the same or worse than George W. Bush’s administration.The result is that Obama in whom the public had long placed more trust than it did in his government finds himself for the first time at the break-even point on the question of whether he is personally honest and trustworthy. That rating which stood at a shimmering +49 percent in the spring of 2009 is almost certainly heading into negative territory.All of that leads to Obama’s lowest job approval rating since April 2012 when the economy again tumbled amid ""headwinds."" It's worth noting that voters are darned cheery about the economy and still are turning on the guy. And the 44 percent who still give him a passing grade will likely shrink too.Obama has consistently questioned the patriotism and motives of his adversaries. It was enough to win him a second term against a candidate whom Team Obama turned (with Mitt Romney’s help) into the personification of corrupt corporate abuse of middle-class America.But as Obama comes under withering attack from left right and center he is finding that many voters don’t think he is on the level either.And Now A Word From Charles“So here is a guy saying ‘It's over essentially. I am winding it down.’ And at the same time running this unbelievably huge invasive program whose only idea whose only basis is the vast terror threat out there. So he doesn't only support the program he contradicts it in public. That's a total lack of leadership and that's why his numbers the poll numbers he now has are markedly down.”-- Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier.”Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News and his POWER PLAY column appears Monday-Friday on FoxNews.com.

358,WASHINGTON — — Fate is fickle power cyclical and nothing is new under the sun. Especially in Washington where after every election the losing party is sagely instructed to confess sin rend garments and rethink its principles lest it go the way of the Whigs. And where the victor is hailed as the new Caesar facing an open road to domination.,1
359,President Obama passed the 100-day mark of his second term facing questions about whether his political capital is already disappearing. Republicans took delight in his discomfort but they have their own 100-day question to answer: What have they done since November to turn around their fortunes?The president has had a difficult spring. His gun legislation though it mustered more than 50 votes was blocked in the Senate. His advisers are more optimistic about immigration reform but the measure still faces serious obstacles especially in the House. Implementation of his health-care law worries some members of his own party. And if there is genuine progress on the budget no one has been able to describe it.What do Republicans have to show politically for the president’s travails? So far there is little to suggest they have truly begun to solve the problems highlighted by Mitt Romney’s loss to Obama last November party weaknesses that were cited in a post-election report by a Republican National Committee task force.Congressional Republicans still have far lower approval ratings than the president although so do congressional Democrats. That is almost always the case. But Republicans also have taken positions on issues this year that have left them on the wrong side of public opinion. Those issues include background checks for gun purchases the best way to deal with the budget (spending cuts alone vs. a combination of cuts and taxes) and to a lesser extent whether illegal immigrants should be given a path to citizenship.In a recent Washington Post-ABC News survey seven out of 10 Americans said the GOP is out of touch with the concerns “of most people” in the country. Neither Obama nor the Democratic Party has sterling ratings on this question (slightly positive for Obama and slightly negative for the Democratic Party). But the Republican deficit is far bigger than that of the other two. Even 49 percent of Republicans said their party is out of touch.Obama’s news conference in two minutes: The president took questions from reporters at the White House on Tuesday discussing Syria the Boston bombings closing Guantanamo immigration reform and Jason Collins. (The Washington Post)Republican opposition to universal background checks for gun purchasers continues to reverberate. The opposition may threaten few individual members given the leanings of individual congressional districts or constituencies in largely Republican-leaning states. But it is likely to hurt Republicans in areas and among voters they need to win presidential races — suburbs and female voters being prime examples.Immigration divideAfter an election in which their nominee won just 27 percent of the Hispanic vote many Republicans said it was time to find a new strategy to attract Hispanics to the party. That brightened prospects for comprehensive immigration reform which George W. Bush tried to enact in his second presidential term only to be thwarted by his own party.Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) whose conservative credentials were not in question took the lead in working out a bipartisan proposal as a member of the Senate Gang of Eight that included Republicans John McCain (Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.). The group’s work raised the hopes of reform advocates that this was the year for action.Since then criticism has been rising on the right echoing complaints from conservatives that killed prior reform efforts. In an op-ed he co-wrote in USA Today former senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina president of the Heritage Foundation and once a strong Rubio backer attacked the proposal as “legislated amnesty.” National Review’s latest cover shows the Florida senator along with two other members of the Gang of Eight — McCain and Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) — with the headline “Rubio’s Folly.”Obama said Thursday in Mexico that he remains optimistic that an immigration reform bill will pass this year saying the time is right for enactment. Rubio now says his proposal probably needs stronger border security measures to pass the Senate and earlier said the bill could not pass the House in its current form presaging a rocky path ahead.The legislative maneuvering has a long way to go. The fact that many of the Republicans who might run for president in 2016 favor immigration reform reflects concern that the party not be cast negatively when this process ends. If Republicans end up blocking the bill or even if it passes but over significant Republican opposition they could pay a significant price with the Hispanic community.Republicans also have not broken through on the economy or the budget. Over the past three years House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has offered a series of comprehensive budgetary blueprints but he has yet to muster broad public support for the main elements of his package.The fact that Obama has spent the winter and spring talking about things other than the economy has given Republicans the opportunity to begin to fill that vacuum. So far they haven’t done so rhetorically or substantively. To most voters the Republican economic message remains focused more on green eyeshade budget accounting than on kitchen-table concerns of middle-class families.Rubio’s engagement on immigration is an example of something that has been missing in the Republican Party’s overall approach during Obama’s tenure which is a willingness to offer concrete and constructive ideas — to be for something rather than just against things — and to go out and really try to sell them.Republican governors from Louisiana’s Bobby Jindal to Wisconsin’s Scott Walker to New Jersey’s Chris Christie to name three of the 30 GOP state leaders have the opportunity to turn their conservative philosophy into a popular governing agenda that could be taken nationally in a presidential race. But for all the flurry of talk about the 2016 race already starting at this point the governors are subordinate to the party’s congressional wing.2014 vs. 2016The year so far highlights the frustrations Obama has experienced trying to work his will on Capitol Hill. As long as his approval rating hovers at or below 50 percent Republicans can look to the 2014 elections with optimism. But the year so far also points to the vulnerabilities of a congressionally based party whose members play to narrower constituencies. And as Republicans learned last year there is often a big difference between the electorates in midterm elections and in presidential elections. A good 2014 does not necessarily mean success in 2016.Had the president been able to maintain the momentum he gained from his reelection victory Republicans would be in even worse shape. GOP pollster Bill McInturff pointed out that the fact that Obama has had setbacks and run into questions “has allowed breathing room for thought recovery and some capacity to regroup.”As long as Obama is in the White House many Republicans will define success as stopping bad things from happening. That could be a trap as the party trades short-term legislative “victories” for what could become longer-term problems. Obama has second-term problems but in this case politics might not be a zero-sum game. If Republicans fail to find a message and an agenda that appeal to a broader constituency they could continue to struggle to win a national election.For previous columns by Dan Balzgo to postpolitics.com.,1

361,Tamara Keith of National Public Radio filed a story Tuesday on efforts by liberal non-profit groups to claim that they too were “targeted” by the IRS just as conservative groups were. None of them however can claim that they were singled out because of their names or views–and many received approval before the 2012 election.Keith notes that several “progressive” groups received extensive inquiries from the IRS when they applied for 501(c)3 or 501(c)4 status including intrusive questions about their donors. Some complain that approval took nearly two years. Keith draws parallels between their experience and that of conservative groups.But Keith notes that “everyone” agrees that what happened to groups with “Tea Party” and “Patriot” in their names was wrong–and could well have added that there are no parallels to some of the worst abuses that conservative groups endured such as questions about the content of their prayers or leaks of donor lists.Keith’s report amplifies one of two narratives Democrats and the left have been spinning in the past several weeks to deflate the IRS scandal. One is that the IRS ought to be investigating political non-profit groups; the other somewhat conflicting story is that the abuse conservative groups experienced was not unique.The story was released on the day that Tea Party groups are gathering for an “Audit the IRS” rally in Washington to protest the agency’s conduct. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee continues its investigation of the IRS as legislators debate calls for a special prosecutor into the scandal.Update: As Breitbart News’ Mike Flynn has noted Democrats did not call any liberal non-profit groups to testify before the House Oversight Committee earlier this month when several of the Tea Party and conservative groups that had been targeted spoke to legislators about their experience of abuses by the IRS.Photo credit: Examiner.com,1
362,The Daily BeastDOJ/Criminal ComplaintA heavy metal guitarist and self-described “founding” member of the Oath Keepers who stormed the U.S. Capitol armed with bear spray has become the first Jan. 6 insurrectionist to plead guilty and cooperate with the feds prosecutors said Friday.Jon Ryan Schaffer a 53-year-old from Indiana pleaded guilty to obstruction of an official proceeding and entering a restricted building with a deadly or dangerous weapon during a Friday hearing. During the hearing Judge Amit Mehta also revealed that Schaffer will be sponsored for witness protection. “The defendant in this case admits forcing his way into the U.S. Capitol on January 6 for the express purpose of stopping or delaying congressional proceedings essential to our democratic process. These actions are disgraceful and unacceptable” FBI Deputy Director Paul M. Abbate said in a statement. The plea which requires his full cooperation with federal prosecutors in their ongoing investigation marks the first time a rioter has copped to his crimes on Jan. 6. It’s been exactly 100 days since thousands of MAGA rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol to prevent Joe Biden's electoral certification. So far 400 individuals have been charged in connection to the riots. Schaffer was released after the Friday hearing until his sentencing though he must now submit to court supervision in the Northern District of Indiana surrender his passport and stay away from Washington D.C. His release came after his attorney argued for no travel restrictions claiming Schaffer is an “internationally known musician and recording artist.”Plea negotiations between Schaffer’s lawyers and federal prosecutors were unintentionally disclosed earlier this month after sealed Department of Justice documents were accidentally filed on the public docket. “The government’s ongoing plea negotiations with this defendant are the first and most advanced plea negotiations involving any of the over 300 Capitol Riot defendants” federal prosecutors wrote in the April 5 filing. By pleading guilty on Friday Schaffer will likely face a four-year prison sentence. The guitarist and lead singer for the heavy metal band Iced Earth was initially charged in January with six crimes for participating in the Jan. 6 siege while wearing a hat that proclaimed him to be an “Oath Keepers Lifetime Member.” Anti-Vaxxer Hubby and Wife Charged After Boasting Online About Capitol RiotIn his plea agreement Schaffer “acknowledged he is a founding lifetime member of the Oath Keepers” and admitted to traveling to D.C. to protest the results of the presidential election which he believed was rigged prosecutors stated.“Schaffer admitted to being among the first individuals to push past the damaged doors and into the Capitol building forcing officers to retreat. Schaffer and others advanced toward five or six backpedaling USCP officers while members of the mob swelled inside of the Capitol and overwhelmed the officers” prosecutors said in a press release announcing his plea agreement. “The officers ultimately deployed a chemical irritant to disperse the mob. Schaffer was among the people who were sprayed in the face after which exited while holding his own bear spray in his hands.”During the siege Schaffer allegedly sprayed multiple U.S. Capitol police officers with bear spray as they breached the government building. A criminal complaint also states Schaffer verbally assaulted officers inside the building. Long before his decision to storm the Capitol alongside his paramilitary members prosecutors state Schaffer held far-right extremist views. “During an interview in 2017 Schaffer identified himself as an ‘anarchist’ and referred to the federal government as a ‘criminal enterprise.’ During that same interview Schaffer stated that the 2016 Presidential election was ‘rigged’” the complaint states. After the election Schaffer attended several Trump rallies protesting the election results including one March event where he told reports “If somebody wants to bring violence I think there’s a lot of us here that are ready for it. We don’t want that but if they bring it we’re going to respond to that trust me.”So far prosecutors have charged over a dozen Oath Keepers with conspiracy including Jessica Watkins a 38-year-old former Army vet accused of recruiting members to “fight hand to hand” to take over the Capitol. Prosecutors describe the Oath Keepers as “an organization that characterizes itself as a militia of former law enforcement and military personnel and has often as a group urged President Trump to declare Martial Law in order to prevent Congress from certifying the Electoral College Results.” Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

363,SAN DIEGO — It’s January 2015 and a newly elected House member from California walks side by side with his male partner to be sworn into office in Washington. The young lawmaker is a supporter of same-sex marriage. He believes the government should keep abortion legal. He considers himself an environmentalist.He's also a Republican.This could be the future for one Carl DeMaio a former San Diego city councilman and recent mayoral candidate who is expected to challenge freshman Democratic Rep. Scott Peters in the state's 52nd congressional district. DeMaio has announced his plan to challenge Peters but the unfolding sexual harassment scandal surrounding San Diego Mayor Bob Filner could also draw DeMaio into a special election for the mayor's office if Filner is recalled.DeMaio 38 doesn’t fit the mold of a traditional Republican. His election could make him the only openly gay GOP member of Congress. (Just two openly gay Republicans have ever served in the House.) DeMaio's views on same-sex marriage and abortion are also at odds with the party platform.But DeMaio says he’s not interested in making social issues central to his campaign. While open about his beliefs his run is focused on government accountability and pocketbook-issue reform instead of relitigating the culture wars.“We ought to take those divisive issues particularly the social issues and set them off to the side” DeMaio told Yahoo News in an interview. “It’s not appropriate for the government to be making decisions for people in their private lives. Instead we should demand that we look beyond labels to embrace common sense ideas on financial reform and holding these government programs accountable.”DeMaio's policy views — economically conservative and socially liberal — place him in a libertarian wing of the Republican Party one that seems to be growing in popularity among young voters. But he's reluctant to put himself in any category.Story continues“I warmly embrace the libertarian label but I also want to point out that one of my biggest frustrations in politics is that people want to shove one or two big labels on some people that sums who they are and what they believe and what their record has been. I think that’s limiting” DeMaio said.Despite his potential of being a maverick if he makes it to Congress DeMaio is not a fringe candidate. He has early support from the party establishment — the National Republican Congressional Committee the official party group responsible for electing Republicans to the House is backing him full force. In July California Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy the third-ranking House Republican hosted a fundraiser for him in Washington. The invitation branded DeMaio as a “New Generation Republican.”Given his background DeMaio seems like just the type of candidate that the soul-searching Republican Party is looking for.“I actually think that we are going to make headway in the Republican Party on these issues in the coming years” DeMaio told Yahoo News. “It is going to be a totally different thrust for the Republican Party.”DeMaio was born in Iowa and his family moved to Southern California when he was a child. DeMaio’s father left the family and his mother died while he was still in high school. Young DeMaio was sent to boarding school at Georgetown Preparatory School near Washington and he went on to graduate from Georgetown University.As a young man in the nation’s capital during Newt Gingrich’s Republican Revolution in 1994 DeMaio plugged into the city’s conservative scene developing his skills as a policy researcher. He took a job with the Congressional Institute a think tank that hosts conferences for lawmakers on policymaking.He went on to found his own group The Performance Institute which does similar work and emphasizes transparency reforms and efficiency in government. Through the 1990s and early 2000s DeMaio established himself as a policy wonk publishing position papers on government reform for various groups including the libertarian Reason Foundation based in California.DeMaio won a seat on the San Diego City Council in 2008 where he focused on several city-based reforms including a successful push to overhaul the costly pension program for city workers by placing new employees into private 401(k)-style retirement accounts.He ran a robust campaign for mayor of San Diego in 2012 losing to Democrat Bob Filner by just 3 percentage points despite a surge in Democratic turnout across the state supporting President Barack Obama's re-election.DeMaio announced his candidacy to challenge Peters in May.A DeMaio victory would give a boost to Republicans in California where the party has been steadily losing ground for two decades. There are currently just 15 Republicans among the state's 55-member congressional delegation the nation's largest.According to early poll numbers DeMaio could be a viable challenger. His mayoral campaign provided him with strong name-ID in the district a crucial leg up for any candidate challenging an incumbent. A Survey USA poll conducted in June 17 months before next year’s election showed DeMaio leading Peters in a hypothetical matchup by 11 percentage points.As with any political campaign DeMaio has also made enemies. His support of the pension overhaul enraged organized labor interests and he won few friends within the gay community when he accepted campaign donations from supporters of the movement to ban same-sex marriage in California. Last year when DeMaio and his partner Jonathan Hale walked together in the San Diego LGBT Pride Parade some in the crowd booed him along the way.Publicly national Democrats dismiss DeMaio as a grandstander. But privately some express concern that he could be a strong challenger to Peters particularly since there is little daylight between the two candidates on some of the social issues that have tripped up other Republican candidates in previous races around the country. The election will also occur midway through Obama's second term an election cycle that historically isn't as hospitable to the president's party.But since DeMaio's former political foe Filner is almost sure to face a well-organized recall campaign in the coming weeks DeMaio is considered a prime candidate to run in a special election to replace him. Filner has conceded behaving inappropriately but is refusing to resign.DeMaio told Yahoo News that he would “absolutely” sign a petition to recall Filner but was coy when asked if he would seek the mayor’s office.“There are benefits and liability in weighing into that question right now” DeMaio told Yahoo News. “I’m going to continue to focus on how we can rid our city of the cancer that is Bob Filner. Until he departs that office our city will be held hostage and our people’s business will not get done.”In San Diego the accusations against Filner (which DeMaio warned about during the campaign against him last year) have dominated the news cycle for weeks. Filner on Tuesday challenged the recall in a written statement but the campaign is likely to begin as early as this month forcing DeMaio to make what will surely be a difficult choice.,1

365,"In the article titled Don't Gloat Leak Charlie Cook tells Republicans how to hide their ""schadenfreude"" by getting reporters who write ""tough stories"" to do their dirty work for them bloodying President Obama up.But as much as congressional Republicans are enjoying their schadenfreude they would be well advised to think long and hard about their next steps. Even the most cursory look at opinion polls or focus groups reveals that the public is convinced we have an ineffectual and out-of-touch Congress that spends too much time backbiting grandstanding and Monday-morning quarterbacking while the country’s problems fester. Arguably showboating for the cameras and holding hearings are what Congress does best; the temptation is unavoidable.This is coming from same guy who on May 14th wrote a piece titled While Republicans Rant about Benghazi and IRS Public Mostly Yawns "" indicating that poll numbers are showing the faux scandals to be having zero impact on President Obama.Well a journalist-pollster with integrity would leave the story at that right? But no. In this day and age there is no such thing as simply reporting facts and leaving them be. Charlie Cook dispenses this ""advise"" to GOP for no other stated reason than to brign President Obama's poll numbers down just so history can be repeated.If the facts don't fit your narrative why gin up your own ""facts""!!The lowest week of Gallup polling thus far for Obama was 40 percent occurring in August and October of 2011. Arguably he is due for a dip given that each of his modern predecessors has dropped into the 30s or below. Presidents Ford Reagan and Clinton each hit a low point of 37 percent. President George W. Bush’s low ebb was 31 percent; Nixon’s was 27 percent; Carter’s was 28 percent; and George H.W. Bush’s was 29 percent.Charlie Cook is after all twiddling his thumbs waiting to see which ""scandals"" real or ginned up """" because "".""Well in Charlie Cook's warped mind that ""something"" can only be negative which must be induced to occur if it doesn't do so naturally. Yeah...This is a more virulent version of the diatribe we heard last year in the run up to the 2012 elections No President has been re-elected with Unemployment rates above 7% then 8% Enthusiasm gap Obama 2008 coalition was a fluke blah blah blah!But reading that piece made me sick. As sequester takes it's horrible toll on many vulnerable people who've been rendered invisible; as GOP House votes to deny those same people access to healthcare (however imperfect it is); as the conservative movement rabidly tears our commonweal apart our Journalists focus on meta on inducing bloodsport so their little historical boxes can be ticked. Really Charlie?...This is the media cauldron within which Democrats are trying to govern these United States of America. PATHETIC!",0
366,"Great minds don’t have to think alike but they ought to be open to discussion say critics of physicist Stephen Hawking who is boycotting a major academic conference in Israel out of solidarity for Palestinians.Hawking wrote a May 3 letter to Israeli President Shimon Peres saying he planned to respect a boycott of the June event because he considers the Israeli government’s policy toward the Palestinian territory a “disaster.” But Israel Maimon chairman of the President’s Conference called boycotting an academic event “outrageous and unwarranted.""""Israel is a democracy in which everyone can voice their opinions whatever they may be” Maimon told the Jerusalem Post. “Boycotting is not compatible with open democratic dialogue.""The decision by Hawking -- who uses a wheelchair due to motor neurone disease -- to skip the event which Peres personally sponsors was initially blamed on health reasons by Cambridge University where the 71-year-old “A Brief History of Time” author has taught and studied.But in his letter to Peres and event organizers Hawking made clear he was boycotting over what he considers Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory.[pullquote]“I accepted the invitation to the Presidential Conference with the intention that this would not only allow me to express my opinion on the prospects for a peace settlement but also because it would allow me to lecture on the West Bank” Hawking wrote. “However I have received a number of emails from Palestinian academics. They are unanimous that I should respect the boycott. In view of this I must withdraw from the conference. Had I attended I would have stated my opinion that the policy of the present Israeli government is likely to lead to disaster.”The Wolf Foundation which gave Hawking its Wolf prize in physics in 1988 said it was “sad to learn that someone of Professor Hawking’s standing chose to capitulate to irrelevant pressures and will refrain from visiting Israel.”However the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions movement which seeks to pressure Israel on behalf of Palestinians said in a statement it “deeply appreciated” Hawking’s decision.",1
367,Eliot Spitzer who resigned as governor of New York five years ago amid a prostitution scandal is re-entering political life with a run for the citywide office of comptroller and a wager that voters are ready to look past his previous misconduct.In a telephone interview on Sunday night Mr. Spitzer 54 sounding restless after an unwelcome hiatus from government said he had re-envisioned the often-overlooked office and yearned to resurrect the kind of aggressive role he played as New York State’s attorney general. He said that after consulting with his family and taking the temperature of the city’s electorate he believed New Yorkers would be open to his candidacy. “I’m hopeful there will be forgiveness I am asking for it” he said.His re-emergence comes in an era when politicians — like Representative Mark Sanford of South Carolina and the New York mayoral contender Anthony D. Weiner — have shown that public disapproval especially over sexual misconduct can be fleeting and that voters seem receptive to those who seek forgiveness and redemption.His decision startled the city’s political establishment which is already unsettled by the rapid rise of Mr. Weiner who also plunged into a campaign without party elders’ blessing.,1

369,"Watching Hillary Rodham Clinton's exit from the State Department is a little like watching the season-ending episode of a popular television series that may not come back the next year. As loyal as its viewers are there are always wary network executives and even exhausted writers and producers who'd just as soon let it go. It's a good policy after all to leave your audience wanting more.Clinton's finale could hardly have been more dramatic. After falling ill with a stomach virus in early December she fainted suffered a concussion and landed in a hospital with a blood clot between her brain and skull. Meanwhile her detractors drummed up conspiracy theories about ""Benghazi fever"" and her supporters had a moment of genuine fear that Clinton might not be around to follow the script that so many have been writing for her over the last several years.That script goes something like this: Clinton will take a long much-deserved vacation then assume a low-key schedule of advocacy work and lucrative speaking engagements. She'll exercise sleep more and eat better.""I would like to see whether I can get untired"" she said in November.Her hair will finally find the sweet spot between the Stepford-esque helmet head of the campaign trail and the current granny-cum-Eileen-Fisher-model look. She might even heaven forfend indulge in some surgically assisted ""freshening up.""And then in late 2014 a more vibrant less jowly Clinton will return to the spotlight and announce her candidacy for president.It'll be a win-win. Voters who supported Clinton in 2008 will be thrilled in a better-late-than-never kind of way. Voters who were so besotted with Barack Obama that they turned on Clinton as if canceling plans with an old friend in favor of a hot date will be thrilled in an all's-right-with-the-universe kind of way.When it comes to historic elections 2008 was just what most Democrats wanted. First the exciting young black guy then the somewhat less exciting but eminently reliable old white lady. It was as if liberal voters promised to eat their vegetables if they could just have dessert first.But as Clinton's health scare reminded us vegetables are perishable. Clinton is 65 and presumably healthy but she cannot be presumed to maintain her past and current energy levels into her 70s. Moreover as she has said numerous times she has no plans to seek the presidency in 2016. She has instead joked that maybe she'll host a decorating show.Nonetheless Clinton's fans are even now closing their eyes and imagining her in the Oval Office. And the idea that she may never get there — by choice defeat or some kind of health or personal circumstance — remains unthinkable even devastating. To put another woman in the job even one that might better uphold the liberal principles that made Clinton's supporters love her in the first place (someone like say Elizabeth Warren) would be a kind of betrayal not to mention a long shot.But for Clinton voters there's something even more devastating than that: admitting that 2008 was their one and only chance and they missed it.During the 2008 Democratic primary when support shifted from Clinton to Obama the rationale was that he stood a better chance of winning. Clinton was too polarizing — too Clintonesque. But there was another rationale: the less-discussed yet widely held belief that an Obama presidency today would in no way preclude a Clinton presidency tomorrow.Amid the rancor of that primary the question for lots of Democrats wasn't ""Which one do we want?"" but ""Which one goes first?"" It wasn't enough to get a candidate elected; they wanted a lock on the successor too.But in real life unlike in a script the gun that appears in the first act isn't guaranteed to go off in the third. Voters may have been willing to wait for a Clinton presidency but that doesn't mean she's going to wait for them.And who could blame her? If her political career were a television drama it would be in something like its 20th season now. Maybe it's time her fans stopped demanding more episodes. Anyway that decorating show sounds promising.Los Angeles TimesMeghan Daum is an essayist and novelist in Los Angeles.mdaum@latimescolumnists.com",1
370,SAN DIEGO — After the headline-inducing sex scandal that led to the resignation of Mayor Bob Filner the special election campaign to find a replacement has been mostly civil and frightfully earnest.With some policy differences at the margins the four top candidates have all promised to improve neighborhood services hire more police officers and streamline city government to help private industry create jobs.Many of the several dozen candidate forums ahead of Tuesday’s vote have focused on improving the city’s infrastructure hardly a rallying cry to inflame voters.“So much of what’s being discussed gets perceived as ‘same old stuff’” said Mark Larson talk show host on KCBQ-AM (1170). “People are talking more about Obamacare than the mayor’s race.”AdvertisementThe name of Filner if uttered at all is said with a sneer.“Bob Filner was a dead-end for this city” said Councilman Kevin Faulconer the only Republican among the four top candidates.Councilman David Alvarez one of three major Democratic candidates in the race prefers not to use Filner’s name at all instead referring to unfinished business at City Hall left by “the last mayor.”If Filner who resigned Aug. 30 and now awaits a Dec. 9 sentencing on sex harassment charges hopes to repair history’s judgment on his brief chaotic tenure as mayor the time has not yet arrived.Advertisement“The final legacy of the Filner fiasco is that his personal peccadilloes cost the city millions in unnecessary electoral and litigation expenses and worse months of leadership and forward movement on a host of pressing issues” said Carl Luna political science professor at San Diego Mesa College.Another aspect of the Filner legacy may be one he never intended: that his resignation gives the Republican Party a chance to reclaim the mayor’s job despite the fact that registration is trending toward Democrats and independents.At last count 40.2% of voters are Democrats 27.7% independents and 27% Republicans.When Filner was elected a year ago as the city’s first Democratic mayor in two decades turnout was nearly 80%. But for this week’s election the county registrar is predicting a 50% turnout.AdvertisementFilner’s resignation may prove to be “a speed bump on the road to a more purple — and eventually blue — San Diego” Luna said.Based on requests for absentee ballots the Democratic turnout particularly in blue-collar neighborhoods south of Interstate 8 is lagging according to a local think tank the National University System Institute for Policy Research.“Unlike November 2012 voter turnout has been low and concentrated in only a handful of neighborhoods” said Vince Vasquez senior policy analyst at the institute and author of the report.The strategy of GOP and business community heavyweights to rally around one candidate — and discourage former Councilman Carl DeMaio from entering the race — appears to be working. At an invitation-only gathering in La Jolla after Filner’s resignation the group decided on Faulconer.AdvertisementPolls now suggest that Faulconer is the only candidate with even an outside chance of winning enough votes to avoid a runoff.In the drive toward election day former Assemblyman Nathan Fletcher had tried to gain advantage by portraying Faulconer as the candidate of an entrenched power structure.“I didn’t need a group of insiders and status-quo folks to anoint me and tell me I could run” Fletcher said to Faulconer during a roundtable discussion among major candidates on KUSI-TV.Alvarez and Fletcher are jousting for the second spot and a runoff with Faulconer early next year. Each has the endorsement of a collection of party notables and labor unions.AdvertisementFletcher finished third in last year’s mayoral primary behind Filner and DeMaio. At the time he was an independent having dumped the Republican Party. Now he’s a Democrat.“As we go through life we change positions” Fletcher said during the roundtable attempting to explain his party shifting.Faulconer 46 in his second term representing a beach district was a close ally of former Mayor Jerry Sanders. Support from Sanders and the editorial page of the U-T San Diego newspaper is key to his campaign.Fletcher 36 who served in Iraq as an enlisted Marine is now an executive at Qualcomm whose co-founder Irwin Jacobs is a major supporter. Alvarez 33 in his first term representing a district south of Interstate 8 is backed by labor unions and the Sierra Club.AdvertisementFormer City Atty. Michael Aguirre 64 the third Democrat among the major candidates is endorsed by the newspaper La Prensa. He refers to his opponents as “fine young men” but decries a political system that requires them to seek endorsements and contributions from groups such as labor unions with issues pending at City Hall.Aguirre has attempted to shift the discussion to the city’s pension payments which he warns will leave little money to improve neighborhood services.The other candidates have shown little interest in dwelling on the pension issue that dominated city politics for nearly a decade and sparked media-fanned public anger aimed at city employees and their labor unions. The issue now seems to have lost its resonance with voters.“I think after Filner people are looking for a little less drama” political consultant John Kern said.Advertisementtony.perry@latimes.com,1

Latest polls show Weiner at fourth place trailing NYC Public Advocate Bill DeBlasio NYC City Council Speaker Christine Quinn and former NYC Comptroller Bill Thompson. The Democratic primary is scheduled for September 10th.Weiner also admitted that he had probably misled the public about when his extramarital affairs ended.""Should I have said it happened on a particular date?

373,While conservatives grapple with Obama’s nomination of former Sen. Chuck Hagel to head the Defense Department the Left is struggling with Obama’s decision to nominate John Brennan as the new CIA Director. Dubbed the “Assassination Czar” by the far-left program Democracy Now Brennan was Obama’s original choice to head the CIA when he was first elected in 2008. An uproar from the left however caused Brennan to withdraw his nomination. With reelection safely behind him though Obama clearly feels emboldened to push again for Brennan.The left’s ire was particularly acute four years ago because Brennan had been a high-level CIA official during the Bush Administration. At the time the left was consumed with moral urgency to reverse many Bush anti-terror policies. Brennan was seen as a key player in the development of those policies.Brennan spent years at the CIA and served as chief of staff to former director George Tenet during the creation of the post-9/11 detention and interrogation programs. The New Yorker’s Jane Mayer described him as a “supporter” of the programs which included torture and the use of secret prison “black sites.”After he withdrew his name for consideration for the CIA job Brennan was appointed by Obama to be his chief counter-terrorism advisor. In that role he has overseen a sweeping expansion of the drone program and adoption of a “kill list” where the President can order targeted assassinations of terrorists.Brennan has helped construct and justify the Administration’s claim that it can kill people including American citizens abroad on its own authority even when those people are not in countries with which we are at war. His speech in April was a sort of catechism culminating in “targeted strikes are wise.” We have done it in Pakistan and Yemen; could we do it in London or Paris?In the aftermath of Brennan’s nomination yesterday the ACLU cautioned the Senate not to proceed with confirmation “until it assesses the legality of his actions in past leadership positions in the CIA during the early years of the George W. Bush administration and in his current role in the ongoing targeted killing program”. ACLU’s statement is telling since the organization doesn’t usually take positions on nominees for the executive branch.Obama’s decision to forge ahead with Brennan’s nomination suggests he feels he has a personal political mandate following his reelection. Brennan’s legacy hasn’t changed in the four years since his name was first floated as CIA Director. If anything the civil libertarian critique of his record has strengthened given the increased use of drone strikes and targeted assassinations.Obama understands however that much of the left’s outrage directed against Bush wasn’t as much about his specific policies as his political affiliation. Obama has continued most of the Bush-era anti-terror policies as even staunch leftists now wearily acknowledge.Although I actively opposed Brennan’s CIA nomination in 2008 I can’t quite muster the energy or commitment to do so now. Indeed the very idea that someone should be disqualified from service in the Obama administration because of involvement in and support for extremist Bush terrorism polices seems quaint and obsolete given the great continuity between Bush and Obama on these issues. Whereas in 2008 it seemed uncertain in which direction Obama would go making it important who wielded influence that issue is now settled: Brennan is merely a symptom of Obama’s own extremism in these areas not a cause. This continuity will continue with or without Brennan because they are rather obviously Obama’s preferred policies.A tiredness usually settles in during a President’s second term. Even the left gets weary of its moral outrage. While the usual suspects are expressing outrage over Brennan’s nomination his confirmation fight will likely end with a whimper. As Greenwald notes these are “obviously Obama’s preferred policies.”,1
374,"A jury in South Bend Indiana has found that fraud put President Obama and Hillary Clinton on the presidential primary ballot in Indiana in the 2008 election. Two Democratic political operatives were convicted Thursday night in the illegal scheme after only three hours of deliberations. They were found guilty on all counts.Former longtime St. Joseph County Democratic party Chairman Butch Morgan Jr. was found guilty of felony conspiracy counts to commit petition fraud and forgery and former county Board of Elections worker Dustin Blythe was found guilty of felony forgery counts and falsely making a petition after being accused of faking petitions that enabled Obama then an Illinois Senator to get on the presidential primary ballot for his first run for the White House.Morgan was accused of being the mastermind behind the plot.According to testimony from two former Board of Election officials who pled guilty Morgan ordered Democratic officials and workers to fake the names and signatures that Obama and Clinton needed to qualify for the presidential race. Blythe then a Board of Elections employee and Democratic Party volunteer was accused of forging multiple pages of the Obama petitions.""I think this helped uphold the integrity of the electoral system"" the prosecutor Stan Levco told reporters.More On This... Trial begins for officials accused in Obama Clinton ballot petition fraud“Their verdict of guilt is not a verdict against Democrats but for honest and fair elections” he said.The scheme was hatched in January of 2008 according to affidavits from investigators who cite former Board of Registration worker Lucas Burkett who told them he was in on the plan at first but then became uneasy and quit. He waited three years before telling authorities about it but if revelations about any forgeries were raised during the election the petitions could have been challenged during the contest. A candidate who did not qualify with enough legitimate signatures at the time could have been bounced from the ballot.The case raise questions about whether in 2008 then candidate Obama actually submitted enough legitimate signatures to have legally qualified for the primary ballot.“I think had they been challenged successfully he probably would not have been on the ballot” Levco told Fox News.Under state law presidential candidates need to qualify for the primary ballots with 500 signatures from each of the state's nine congressional districts. Indiana election officials say that in St. Joseph County which is the 2nd Congressional district the Obama campaign qualified with 534 signatures; Clinton's camp had 704.Prosecutors say that in President Obama's case nine of the petition pages were apparently forged. Each petition contains up to 10 names making a possible total of 90 names which if faked could have brought the Obama total below the legal limit required to qualify. Prosecutors say 13 Clinton petitions were apparently forged meaning up to 130 possibly fake signatures. Even if 130 signatures had been challenged it would have still left Mrs. Clinton with enough signatures to meet the 500 person threshold.Levco said a total of “100 to 200” signatures had been forged on Obama’s and Clinton’s petitions.An Indiana State Police investigator said in court papers that the agency examined the suspect Obama petitions and ""selected names at random from each of the petition pages and contacted those people directly. We found at least one person (and often multiple people) from each page who confirmed that they had not signed"" petitions ""or given consent for their name and/or signature to appear.""Numerous voters told Fox News that they never signed the petitions.""That's not my signature"" Charity Rorie a mother of four told us when we showed her the Obama petition with her name and signature. She was stunned saying that it ""absolutely"" was a fake.Charity told Fox News that her husband's entry was also a forgery and that they have never been contacted by investigators or any authorities looking into the scandal.""It's scary it's shocking. It definitely is illegal"" she told us.Robert Hunter Jr. told Fox news that his name was faked too.""I did not sign for Barack Obama"" he told us. As he examined the Obama petition in his hands Hunter pointed out that ""I always put 'Junior' after my name every time...there's no 'Junior' thereEven a former Democratic Governor of Indiana Joe Kernan told Fox News that his name was forged.“This is a bitter sweet moment for free and fair elections"" observed Ryan Nees the Indiana born Yale “University senior who first exposed the scheme in the independent political newsletter Howey Politics Indiana and South Bend Tribune.Nees said the multiple guilty verdicts were ""bitter because a five-person conspiracy succeeded in illegally placing two presidential candidates on the ballot but sweet because they were exposed tried for their crimes and convicted.""Nees previously told Fox News that the fraud was clearly evident ""because page after page of signatures are all in the same handwriting"" and that nobody raised any red flags ""because election workers in charge of verifying their validity were the same people faking the signatures.""Fox News' Meredith Amor contributed to this report.",1

376,"""We can't drive our SUVs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times ... and then just expect that other countries are going to say ‘OK.’ That's not leadership. That's not going to happen.”-- Then-Sen. Barack Obama at a campaign rally in Oregon May 17 2008.World leaders don’t seem to be paying much heed to President Obama. And not just when it comes to domestic spy leaker Edward Snowden’s ultimate destination.Obama today will announce what promises to be a hammer blow to cheap coal-fired electricity as part of his legacy project of curbing global warming. But as Obama prepares to deliver what U.S. environmentalists hope will be a knockout punch to coal power here the rest of the world is gobbling up every coal BTU it can get.U.S. carbon emissions dropped last year more than any other major industrialized country due in substantial part to the first round of Obama’s EPA regulations (aided by cheaper natural gas from Obama-approved fracking and a perpetually sluggish economy).Meantime China India Russia and other growing economies were firing up the coal furnaces. In the last decade global carbon output increased by 2.6 billion tons beyond anything emitted in the United States according to BP’s latest global survey on energy and the environment.Obama and new Secretary of State John Kerry say they remain committed to making the U.S. a signatory to a U.N. carbon treaty. As unlikely as that may be in the U.S. Senate it looks even more unlikely given the tendencies in other major emitters. President Putin of Russia and President Xi of China seem especially unlikely to do anything that would slow their domestic growth to levels seen in places already under a carbon crackdown like the U.S. and Europe.But Obama who as a candidate promised to “bankrupt” power companies that rely on coal power will today make good. This action he says will set an example for the other nations to follow.The courts and the voting public have blocked Obama from delivering any of his comprehensive plans on carbon dioxide which he and many others attribute to an increase in global temperatures prior to the late 1990s.Global temperatures have been steady for the last 15 or so years despite massive increases in carbon dioxide output. Climatologists who believe mankind is driving climate changes are looking for ways to explain why warming has stalled despite forecasts that the past 15 years would bring catastrophic warming. Their models have so far proved incorrect.But those extremely alarmed about carbon including Obama argue that the consequences are still seen in severe weather events like hurricanes and tornadoes.Obama who is working hard to shore up his political base after revelations that he hugely expanded secret domestic surveillance programs may not be able to impose federal fees on carbon emissions or regulate carbon dioxide as a toxic substance as he previously tried to do but he still may be able to make electricity so expensive that his preferred green alternatives (especially given heavy federal subsidies) will be cost-effective.[pullquote]This effort will be even more important to Obama’s shaky political fortunes if he as expected accedes to pressure from business and labor groups to authorize a pipeline to bring Canadian oil to American refineries. Environmentalists are howling over the project that they say will increase U.S. complicity in climate change. Obama needs something to offer these folks already unhappy to find out the size of his domestic spy regime if he really is going to cave on Keystone.Obama doesn’t need Congress to cripple carbon. By expanding the EPA’s standards for new plants to existing plants Obama will hasten the conversion to fracked natural gas by utilities. Even though the programs will take time to implement and face legal challenges power companies have long seen the writing on the wall and are already switching to more expensive fuels. The conversion and the price increases due to heightened demand will accelerate.The idea here is for Americans to pay the price to show a moral example on climate to the rest of the world. It’s not that it will make much difference to the composition of the atmosphere but that previously reticent nations will want to follow suit.But as it turns out the world doesn’t much care about America’s carbon footprint. For most of the planet’s 7 billion residents the question is how they are living not what the United States is emitting. Add to that the mounting questions about climate science and it is hard to see Putin and others jumping on the bandwagon of more expensive energy.Today’s announcement will be more good news for the president’s patrons and political partners in the green energy and natural gas businesses who have already benefited hugely from his policies. But as far as changing the planet its looking like a great big “nyet.”And Now A Word From Charles“The fact that people don’t like the United States is not new. What’s new is that these non-likers have no respect for the United States.”-- Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier.”Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News and his POWER PLAY column appears Monday-Friday on FoxNews.com.

377,If history dwells at all on President Obama’s trip this week to California it will probably be because of his Friday meeting in Rancho Mirage with President Xi Jinping of China. When the leaders of the globe’s two great powers meet scribblers pay attention.But for one middle-class constituent who almost landed on Obama’s agenda the quick Western swing will be forever remembered for the meeting that did not happen a subsequent tumble into the politico-media mulcher and what Paul Scott now hopes will be a mostly happy ending.AdvertisementAll Scott a 60-year-old car salesman from Santa Monica wanted was to promote the virtues of electric cars. He co-founded the nonprofit Plug In America and had a featured role in the 2006 documentary “Who Killed the Electric Car?”So when an email invitation arrived for Friday’s Democratic National Committee fundraiser in Santa Monica — with a $32400 donation opening the door to a special reception and a few minutes of face time with the president — Scott thought about it a little. He’d given a few hundred dollars before. This time he decided to go all in.AdvertisementIt was an outsized play for a guy who earns $50000 to $60000 a year and doesn’t have a huge savings account. “This was the biggest thing I had ever done in my life” said Scott who simply had to tell the president how much more he could do to talk Americans out of their gas guzzlers and into electric vehicles.To get maximum voltage out of his investment the silver-haired salesman wrote a column and emailed it to dozens of news outlets. In “My Lunch with Obama” he wrote about why he was willing to pay “a large percentage of my retirement savings” for the chance to ask the president a question or two.AdvertisementScott calculated that in little more than a decade he had saved $16000 by harnessing solar energy at his home and funneling some of it to his electric-powered Nissan Leaf just like the ones he sells at a downtown dealership.“It begs the question” he wrote “what would our planet and political process look like if millions of Americans stopped giving hundreds of billions to polluting industries and spent their savings instead on locally generated renewable electricity and local goods and services?”AdvertisementUSA Today and several automotive publications picked up the story. That in turn provoked a second wave of interest from conservative commentators. Their focus was on the appearance that the Democrats were selling access to the president.Conservative firebrand Michelle Malkin’s website headlined: “Electric car advocate pays $16k a minute to personally ask Obama to push carbon tax.” The story blew up online when it was picked up by the Drudge Report.AdvertisementOn Monday Scott received another email from the Democratic National Committee informing him he was no longer welcome at the luncheon and his $32400 would be returned. “They insinuated that I did it to gain media attention” Scott said.On that count he pleads guilty. “I support Democratic politicians and I certainly support the president; he is a fantastic president” Scott said. “But I also have a message that is crucially important for our society and I have to get that message out any way I can.”AdvertisementOfficials at the DNC did not respond to a request for comment.The party’s earlier email to potential donors said $10000 would get a seat at Friday’s lunch $16200 a picture with the president and $32400 a photo and “a very special one-hour round table discussion with the President after the luncheon.”AdvertisementKelly R. Olsen a former Santa Monica City Council member planned to make a video of his friend’s thoughts about his presidential encounter. Olsen helped move the city’s vehicle fleet to clean-burning fuels in the 1990s. He calls Scott “a human being who is dedicated and believes in something ... and was willing to put his money where his mouth is.”Olsen thinks Scott got blackballed because he “pulled back the curtain” on the way politicians exchange access for contributions.AdvertisementScott does not want to dwell on the negative. He said it was never his intention to point out the unseemly side of money in politics. He is not a man who believes in half-measures. A onetime marathoner and self-taught gymnast he spends long sessions on the rings and parallel bars next to the Santa Monica Pier.He will sell only the electric Leaf and directs customers who want an internal-combustion vehicle to co-workers. “I won’t sell a gas car” he said. “My goal in life is to get as many of them off the road as humanly possible.”AdvertisementHe rattles off petroleum industry statistics: $700 billion spent per year in America on oil products an estimated $80 billion annually for military protection of oil assets and $10 billion in subsidies for the industry. That’s not counting increased healthcare costs from dirtier air or for environmental cleanups after oil spills he adds.He wants a tax on carbon — and thus gasoline — to cover those indirect societal costs. That’s one of the things he hoped to discuss with Obama. Another was the benefits of “hyper-miling” the practice of efficiently accelerating and coasting that Scott says can improve fuel efficiency by as much as 30%.Advertisement“I am terribly disappointed to not see the president” Scott said “but the most important thing is getting the message out. We have got to move the needle on this issue.”james.rainey@latimes.com,1
378,by Alec KohutThe video Maryland Democrat Chris Van Hollen’s recent “parliamentary inquiry” on the floor of the House of the Representatives is making the rounds and will likely be seen by millions by the end of the week. I include this video at the bottom of the page.The video puts to rest any argument that the GOP wants to end the shutdown and get government working again. Perhaps they are having too much fun waving confederate flags in front of the White House. The bill H.R. 368 forbids anyone except “the Majority Leader or his designate” from bringing a clean continuing resolution to the floor for vote.Now it doesn’t surprise me in the least that Republicans would do this. It doesn’t outrage me that the use of backhanded undemocratic measures are being employed by the party controlled by Tea Party loons.What does infuriate me is the fact the seven Democrats crossed party lines to vote for a resolution that gives Eric Cantor and only Eric Cantor the ability to bring fourth a vote a clear CR to get the government working aging…and yes open the monuments.And now several of the seven House Democrats that voted for HR 368 are Tweeting and saying that they want a clean CR and are supporting the discharge petition. But I’m not falling for it. These seven members willfully voted against democracy and supported the GOP’s effort to create yet another manufactured crisis.The seven back-stabbing turncoat worthless Democrats are:Ron Barber AZ-2John Barrow GA-12Dan Maffei NY-24Sean Patrick Maloney NY-18Jim Matheson UT-4Mike McIntyre NC-7Collin Peterson MN-7Here’s what some of these dishonest Reps. have been Tweeting:These are examples back-stabbing Democrats who side with the Tea Party when they think we’re not watching then want us honest Democrats to believe them in wanting the shutdown to end.Words are not capable of expressing my outrage and pure contempt for these low-life scumbag traitors in our party.Thank you Chris Van Hollen for pulling back the curtain and exposing these truly worthless Democrats!Here's Van Hollen's Floor action:http://youtu.be/...,1
379,Story highlights Senior officials say Biden apologized to Obama on Wednesday Obama responded that Biden was speaking from the heart they say Biden's weekend remarks spurred Obama to announce his support for same-sex marriage(CNN) —Vice President Joe Biden has apologized to President Barack Obama for putting him in a tough position that led to Obama’s announcement that he now supports same-sex marriage senior administration officials said Thursday.Obama said in an interview that aired Thursday on ABC that he made his decision public earlier than he had planned after Biden’s weekend remark that he was “absolutely comfortable” with letting gays and lesbians marry.Two senior administration officials said Biden and Obama met Wednesday morning and Biden apologized for putting Obama in a tough spot. Obama responded by saying that he knew Biden was speaking from the heart said the officials who didn’t want to be named discussing private conversations between the president and vice president.Biden’s remarks on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday launched a controversy that led to Obama announcing that his position on same-sex marriage which he had previously called “evolving” had shifted to support. When Obama’s full interview aired Thursday he said his disclosure came sooner than planned as a result of Biden’s comments.“I had already made a decision that we were going to probably take this position before the election and before the convention” Obama said on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” Biden “probably got out a little bit over his skis but out of generosity of spirit” he said.He added that he would have “preferred to have done this in my own way on my own terms” but “all’s well that ends well.”Separately Biden spokeswoman Kendra Barkoff said Obama “has been the leader on this issue from day one and the vice president never intended to distract from that.”Once Biden’s comments drew attention to the issue Obama made plans to announce his support next week on a previously scheduled appearance on the ABC talk show “The View” a senior administration official said Thursday. The president and his advisers knew Obama would be asked about the issue in the wake of Biden’s NBC interview said the official who didn’t want to speak publicly about internal administration discussions.Ultimately they decided to move up the timeline and have him announce his support during the ABC interview at the White House the official said. And a top Democrat told CNN that Obama knew the issue would come up at the convention partly because of a push for support for same-sex marriage to be included in the Democratic Party platform and in debates.Multiple top Democrats told CNN the president’s senior aides are annoyed with Biden for forcing the conversation on same-sex marriage now. One source said Biden has in the past counseled the president against coming out for same-sex marriage making this move that much more frustrating.But the sources said they don’t believe it will create a lasting rift between the two leaders. Biden is known to go off-script something Obama knew when he selected his vice president.In explaining to ABC how his position has evolved Obama noted that his daughters Malia and Sasha have “friends whose parents are same-sex couples. It wouldn’t dawn on them that somehow their friends’ parents would be treated differently. And frankly that’s the kind of thing that prompts a change of perspective not wanting to somehow explain to your child why somebody should be treated differently when it comes to the eyes of the law.”Asked about whether his new position is a calculated move in an election year Obama said it would “be hard to argue that somehow this is something that I’d be doing for political advantage. Because frankly you know the politics – it’s not clear how they cut.”The interview aired the same day Obama attended a fundraiser in Los Angeles where support for same-sex marriage is strong. Movie star George Clooney hosted the event which is raking in $15 million according to a top Democratic source. And on Monday openly gay singer Ricky Martin is hosting a fundraising event for Obama in New York.But some in the African-American community have expressed strong disapproval of Obama’s endorsement of same-sex marriage. A Democratic official said the White House has been actively reaching out to African-American community leaders and pastors and will continue to do so in the wake of the president’s decision but the official noted that even the president’s base won’t always agree with him on everything. “There are going to be issues you don’t agree on” the official said.And Obama told ABC he won’t spend much time talking about the issue because he’s focused on the economy. The announcement puts Obama squarely at odds with presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney who has since reiterated his opposition to same-sex marriage.“And I do not favor civil unions if they are identical to marriage other than by name” Romney said during a Wednesday visit to Fort Lupton Colorado. “My view is the domestic partnership benefits hospital visitation rights and the like are appropriate but that the others are not.”The issue is a divisive one in American politics but it’s uncertain how the development might play out at the voting booth.A Gallup Poll released Tuesday indicated 50% of Americans believe same-sex marriages should be recognized by law as valid with 48% saying such marriages should not be legal – a dramatic shift from a few years ago. A Gallup poll in 2009 found 40% supported same-sex marriage and 57% were opposed.But a CNN/ORC International poll taken in late March indicated policies toward gays and lesbians were tied for last in people’s opinions of the most-important issues facing the country.Obama said he supports states deciding the issue on their own but added that he was “disappointed” by Tuesday’s vote on the issue in North Carolina where a ban on same-sex marriage was added to the constitution. Obama called the amendment discriminatory against gays and lesbians a spokesman said earlier Wednesday.Six states – Massachusetts Connecticut Iowa Vermont New Hampshire and New York – and the District of Columbia issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples while 31 states have voted in favor of constitutional amendments that seek to defend traditional definitions of marriage as a heterosexual union.In February Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire signed a bill that would legalize same-sex marriage beginning in June but opponents there have pledged to block the bill and called for voters to decide the issue. Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley signed into law a bill that permits the state’s same-sex couples to wed as of January 1 and state residents may vote to affirm such a law.Minnesota will vote on a state constitutional amendment similar to the one in North Carolina while Maine will have a referendum on allowing same-sex marriage. Meanwhile two cases seeking to overturn laws forbidding the practice one from California and another from Massachusetts could be headed to the U.S. Supreme Court in coming months.CNN’s Josh Levs Phil Gast Bill Mears Dan Gilgoff and Jim Acosta contributed to this report.,0
380,John EastmanHuman Rights Campaign published a confidential tax return of the National Organization for Marriage.There is no question that someone at the IRS leaked the document that was published by the HRC.It is imperative that Congressional investigators get to the bottom of the issue.The world is learning about the corruption of the IRS in targeting conservative groups including various Tea Party organizations for heightened scrutiny. But the corruption goes much deeper than harassing groups seeking first time non-profit designations into actively sabotaging existing non-profit groups by releasing confidential information.In March of 2012 the Human Rights Campaign published a confidential tax return of the National Organization for Marriage which was immediately republished byThe Huffington Post and other liberal news media outlets. The HRC and NOM are the leading national groups on opposing sides of the fight over gay marriage. HRC wants to redefine marriage to make it genderless while NOM wishes to preserve marriage as the union of one man and one woman.NOM a targetMy organization was not the only conservative-linked political group or business that appears to have faced shady actions from IRS employees. ProPublica reported this week that the IRS handed over to them confidential documents of nine conservative organizations whose applications for non-profit status were still pending. Among them: Crossroads GPS a key group backing Mitt Romney's presidential campaign.Our case was particularly egregious because the IRS leak of confidential information fed directly into an ongoing political battle. For months before March 2012 the pro-gay marriage HRC had been demanding that my group NOM publicly identify its major donors something that NOM and many other non-profits refuse to do. The reason is simple. In the past gay marriage advocates have used such information to launch campaigns of intimidation against traditional marriage supporters.Just as gay marriage proponents were demanding the information the IRS appears to have illegally given them exactly what they were looking for. The tax return released by the HRC contained the names and addresses of dozens of major donors to NOM. And there's little doubt where the documents came from. The tax returns contained internal coding added by the IRS after the returns were originally submitted.For the IRS to leak any organization's tax return to its political opponents is an outrageous breach of ethics and if proven constitutes a felony. Every organization — liberal and conservative — should shudder at the idea of the IRS playing politics with its confidential tax return information. But the situation here is even more egregious because the head of the HRC was at the time serving as a national co-chair of President Obama's re-election campaign.The release of NOM's confidential tax return to the Human Rights Campaign is the canary in the coal mine of IRS corruption. Contrary to assertions that the targeting of Tea Party groups was an error in judgment by low-level IRS bureaucrats the release of NOM's confidential data to a group headed by an Obama campaign co-chair suggests the possibility of complicity at the highest levels of politics and government. This wasn't a low-level error in judgment; it was a conscious act to reward a prominent Obama supporter while punishing an opponent.That's the reason the IRS has not been very interested in getting to the bottom of what happened. Federal investigators have interviewed NOM officials about the matter but our efforts to find out what has become of the investigation have been stonewalled at every turn.Not about marriageThe tendency of some is to set this serious issue aside because it is seemingly part of the war on traditional marriage an issue that divides the country in half and bedevils many. But given the broader issues being raised about the IRS that's not right.At this stage nobody is accusing the White House or the Obama re-election campaign of illegal activity. But there is a serious question about whether there was communication or possible collusion between the IRS and the HRC and if there was whether anyone at the White House or the Obama re-election campaign was involved.It is imperative that congressional investigators get to the bottom of the issue. If the IRS can get away with leaking NOM's confidential tax return to its chief political opponent then no taxpayer is safe from political retribution by the federal government.John Eastman a constitutional law professor at Chapman University is chairman of theNational Organization for Marriage.In addition to its own editorials USA TODAY publishes diverse opinions from outside writers including our Board of Contributors.,1
381,Sarah Palin called on President Barack Obama to “pay his respects” to slain American hero Chris Kyle with “some gesture of condolence” before she along with her husband Todd attended Kyle’s public memorial and funeral service in Dallas TX Monday at Cowboys Stadium. The Palins became good friends with Kyle in the past two years.Kyle the former Navy SEAL and author of American Sniper a New York Times bestseller was murdered on February 2 at a Texas gun range allegedly by a former Marine suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) whom Kyle was trying to help.In a Facebook note Palin wrote she found it “sad to see that flags aren’t flying at half staff for this American hero” and hoped Obama “pays his respects in some gesture of condolence” for someone who “sacrificed so much to keep him and all of us safe.”Obama has publicly acknowledged people like Sandra Fluke and famous rappers but he is not attending Kyle’s funeral and did not issue a statement after Kyle’s death.“We may never know to what extent Chris kept us free or how many lives he saved by his brave actions in the line of fire. But his fellow warriors know how important he was. My son Track couldn’t meet Chris when Todd and I first met him because Track was deployed to Iraq” Palin wrote. “Then when we got to know Chris even better our son was deployed in Afghanistan. We’ve met a lot of people in recent years and Track has been privileged to meet them as well. But he said about Chris ‘Mom he’s the ONE person in the entire world I would be star-struck to meet. He’s it.'”Palin first met Kyle during the premiere of Stephen K. Bannon’s “The Undefeated” movie in Pella Iowa in 2011. Kyle was in charge of security for that event.After attending the funeral Palin suggested ways to honor and remember Kyle and in another Facebook posting wrote:It was a beautiful memorial service for Chris Kyle at Cowboys Stadium this afternoon. What a celebration of a great life! All in all is there a finer human being who has crossed the 50-yard line star in Texas than Chris Kyle? Please click on the following link for information on how we can help out the families of Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield. As patriotic Americans this is a tangible way to show appreciation and support for good people. On a personal note I thank you who’ve sent birthday greetings today and it would be awesome if you’d join me in supporting the families of these heroes by helping them out!The Palins got to know Kyle better when Todd Palin was on the show “Stars Earn Stripes” with Kyle. The Palins along with the rest of the cast spent a lot of time on set with Kyle’s family. Kyle was the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history.“God bless this great warrior” Palin said. “Let us keep his wife and children in our prayers and may we never forget him or his sacrifice.”Photos courtesy of Andy Badolato,1
382,Neither will give another dime to any Senate Democrat who does not support expanded background checks I’m told — and both will suggest to other donors that they do the same. The move underscores the rising importance of gun control as an issue in Democratic politics — and the rising frustration in some Democratic circles with elected officials who continue to regard gun politics as a third rail at a moment that presents a real opportunity to achieve serious reform with a policy that enjoys near universal public support.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“At some point you have to draw a line in the sand — for me that time is now” Lerer told me in an interview. “If candidates or officeholders can’t support something like comprehensive and enforceable background checks then I wouldn’t think of giving them any money going forward.”Lerer also said he would be intensifying his contributions to Democratic Senate candidates in the next few years — excluding any that don’t take a strong position on gun control. “We intend to get very active in Senatorial campaigns during the next cycle and the one after” he said. Red state Dems up for reelection in 2014 include Mary Landrieu Kay Hagan Mark Begich Mark Pryor and Max Baucus.Bohnett too will not give any more money to Dems who balk on guns. “If they don’t do the right thing on background checks donors like David won’t be able to support them” Michael Fleming who advises Bohnett on his political and philanthropical giving told me. “You look at what some senators from rather conservative states have done when it comes to supporting marriage equality — they ‘re willing to take a tough stand. We would expect nothing less on the gun issue.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“We will certainly share our concerns with our fellow funders” Fleming added.Michael Bloomberg’s pro-gun-control group Mayors Against Illegal Guns has been informally reaching out to top Democratic contributors and encouraging them to evaluate candidates on the basis of their support for strong gun legislation I’m told.,1

384,Don’t look for a new Justice Department report about American gun violence to receive any serious media coverage over the coming days or ever. According to the report from the department’s Bureau of Statistics every argument the media and the left are currently making to push for new restrictions on our Second Amendment civil rights are made up of anti-science nonsense. This report not only proves the media wrong it proves the NRA right.Between the years of 1993 and 2011 as the assault weapons ban expired more Americans purchased guns the Supreme Court overturned outright gun bans and individual states not only loosed gun control restrictions but also issued concealed carry permits to private citizens incidents of gun violence in America collapsed.Between 1993 and 2011 nonfatal gun crimes plummeted 69%; from 1.5 million to 467300. Gun-related murders dropped 40%; from 18253 to 11101. Gun-related murders for black Americans plummeted by 51%.The report also shows that the media-created hysteria over school shootings is wildly misleading. Between ’93 and ’11 the murder rate in schools dropped by almost a third; from 29 to 20.Background checks have also been exposed as another bogus narrative the media’s crafted out of thin air. This report proves beyond any doubt that closing the so-called gun show loophole will accomplish next to nothing. Less than one-percent of state prisoners caught with a gun purchased it at a gun show. Moreover who knows how many of those criminals might have passed or did pass a background check.So-called assault weapons are also not a problem Only “2% of state inmates and 3% of federal inmates were armed with a military-style semiautomatic or fully automatic firearm.”What this study clearly shows is that Obama Democrats and the media don’t give a damn about stopping gun violence. If they did they would be focused on everything but the one and two-percent problems.What we have here is a yet-another culture war; nothing more nothing less — and one aimed at the type of law-abiding citizens who attend gun shows and enjoy these so-called assault weapons. In other words Red State conservatives.What is especially crucial to keep in mind is that 2011 is not some kind of outlier. If you study the original report you will see that these decreases are all part of an 18-year trend not an outlier year or two.This report is extremely good news is you are the kind of person who gives a damn about human life.But if you are cynical power-hungry Democrats more uncomfortable with the idea of human freedom than you are pleased with a decrease in human life this report is bad news. Furthermore if you are a dishonest member of the media who believes that delivering political wins to Democrats is more important than human life this report is also bad news.There is just no question that an armed American populace is a safer American populace. This study also proves that smart policing and a willingness to award serious jail time to violent offenders (two areas our criminal justice system have focused on over the last two decades) does a helluva lot more to decrease the rate of gun violence than purely symbolic gun-grabbing laws.Thanks to this study we also know for a fact now that the Newtown massacre is being exploited by the media only to demonize Obama’s political enemies.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC,1
385,President John F. Kennedy and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy using the skeet range at Camp David.This column has been updated with a new rulingThe New Republic: “Have you ever fired a gun?”President Obama: “Yes in fact up at Camp David we do skeet shooting all the time.”New Republic: ”The whole family?”Obama: “Not the girls but oftentimes guests of mine go up there. And I have a profound respect for the traditions of hunting that trace back in this country for generations. And I think those who dismiss that out of hand make a big mistake.”— from an interview published Jan. 27 2013A number of readers have raised questions about the president’s statement that he goes skeet shooting “all the time” while at Camp David. In these suspicious times they would like to see some evidence.But the White House has been oddly silent about the matter.On Monday White House spokesman Jay Carney said he did know how often the president has gone skeet shooting and that he has not seen a photograph. “When he goes to Camp David he goes to spend time with his family and friends and relax not to produce photographs” Carney told reporters.Of course this did not stop the White House from releasing these photographs in 2011. (Obama is shown at Sasha Obama’s birthday party at Camp David; the second was taken the same weekend of Vice President Biden but that is not at Camp David):Then on Wednesday Carney tersely said he had no response to a challenge from Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) for a skeet shooting contest with the president.We e-mailed a White House official on Tuesday and then Carney twice on Wednesday asking for the name of an Obama guest at Camp David who could confirm the president’s account. (The White House does not publicly release the names of guests.) We received no response all three times.So let’s review what we do know.The FactsIn skeet shooting participants use shotguns to hit clay disks that are automatically flung into air in an effort to simulate bird hunting. An interesting blog about Camp David in a post from 2010 reports that many presidents have enjoyed skeet shooting at the rustic retreat. (Check out the photo of John F. Kennedy skeet shooting with future Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee.) The blog also displays overhead images over the years showing that the skeet range is located near the helicopter pad.We searched high and low through hundreds of news reports to see if there was ever any other mention of Obama engaged in skeet shooting. We found that Obama in a weekly radio address in 2012 congratulated Kim Rhode on becoming “the first American to win individual medals in five straight Olympics with her gold in skeet shooting” and Army Sgt. Vincent Hancock for a second skeet gold.But when the Olympic athletes later visited the White House Obama did not make a reference to having attempted skeet shooting. Instead he spoke of other sports that moved him to do better:“But I was inspired to watch you guys even though I couldn’t do what you do. I was inspired to run a little bit faster watching Tyson Gay and lift a little more after watching Holley Mangold or do a few more crunches after watching Michael Phelps and the other swimmers. Somehow it didn’t work quite on me.”In 2011 Politico reported that Obama was “an infrequent visitor” to Camp David compared to other presidents:Those close to Obama say the president — who owns a home in Chicago — is more of an “urban guy” who prefers hitting the basketball court and the golf course on weekends to blow off steam. On a sunny Sunday afternoon upon returning from Camp David on his most recent trip Obama headed straight for the links. And while Camp David includes a movie theater bowling alley swimming pool and endless biking and hiking trails Obama prefers to stick close to the White House when he’s not on vacation.Again no mention of skeet shooting.(UPDATE: A reader pointed us to an Associated Press article in 2010 which reported that after Obama met with the Texas Christian University national championship rifle team one team member quoted Obama as saying he had practiced shooting a rifle with the Secret Service.)We also could not find evidence that Obama ever tried skeet shooting before he became president.During the 2008 campaign a group that called itself the American Hunters and Shooters Association — which some pro-gun groups attacked as a front for anti-gun forces — endorsed Obama and announced he would attend a skeet shooting event in September in Colorado. “The Obama campaign says the skeet shooting event will highlight the Democrat’s support of the Second Amendment and hunting rights” the Associated Press reported. But Ray Schoenke a former Washington Redskins football player who headed the organization said in an interview Wednesday that in the end Obama did not attend the Colorado event.Schoenke said that after Obama’s election the organization — which he said was intended to bridge the gap between urban liberals and rural gun owners — closed down because of lack of support from the Obama administration. He said he did many events in support of the Obama campaign in 2008 but Obama never mentioned having ever handled a firearm.During a September 2008 campaign event in Duryea Pa.. Obama was point blank asked if he was “going to take away the guns.” He gave a rather long answer but he made no reference to having used a weapon himself — and this certainly would have been the perfect moment. Instead he speaks of “your guns:”“The bottom line is this: If you’ve got a rifle you've got a shotgun you've got a gun in your house I'm not taking it away. All right? So they can keep on talking about it but this is just not true.“And by the way even if — here's another thing you've got to understand. Even if I wanted to take it away I couldn’t get it done. I don't have the votes in Congress….“It's your guns. We're not going to mess with them all right? I hope I made that clear. Is everybody clear back there in the back? Because I see a couple sportsmen back there. All right? Spread the word with your friends. I'm not going to take away your guns.”Generally a politician who has handled firearms will advertise that fact to gun owners. Indeed here’s how Obama’s 2008 rival for the Democratic nomination then-Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke about guns after another mass killing that year according to the AP:Clinton told an audience she supported gun rights two days after a student opened fire on the campus of Northern Illinois University killing five before turning the gun on himself. Clinton said she believed in getting guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill even as she favored protecting the rights of law abiding gun owners.“I've gone hunting” she said. “I know you may not believe it but it's true. My father taught us to shoot.”Clinton told reporters later she had once shot a duck in Arkansas along with “a lot of tin cans targets and some skeet.”The Pinocchio TestThe evidence suggests that until Obama had access to a shooting range as president he never went skeet shooting. He certainly did not speak like a politician who had once used a firearm.But it is also curious that the White House refuses to provide any documentary evidence that he actually used the shooting range at Camp David since he claims he uses it “all the time” or that a presidential friend has not come forward to confirm the president’s comments.We live in suspicious times and the president lives in a media fishbowl. That’s the way it is. In the meantime we do not have enough information to make a ruling one way or the other. We are eager to see a photograph or hear from someone who saw him at the skeet range to put this matter to rest.UPDATE: A reader notes that because Obama said he does skeet shooting “all the time” perhaps our standard of proof should be higher--such as several photographs. That’s a reasonable point. We have also been asked why we did not immediately award Pinocchios such as when Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) made unproven claims about Mitt Romney’s taxes. We try to avoid using “verdict pending” but in cases of self-aggrandizement we are willing to be a bit more patient. Obviously if the White House is not forthcoming with additional evidence then the claim becomes increasingly doubtful.UPDATE Feb. 2: The White House released this photograph of the president at the Camp David skeet range on Aug. 4 2012. We are pleased the White House has become more forthcoming about this matter though it does not quite answer the questions concerning the president’s “all the time” language. What do readers think? (Also given some of the controversy this column generated we refer you to a negative critique that appeared on Mediaite which certainly reflects the views of a number of readers who are upset that we thought this was even an issue.)UPDATE: As one might expect there is a vast divide on this with some readers upset that we did not immediately change our ruling because the president released a photo as we had requested in our original column. We try not to make snap judgements but readers argued we had moved the goal posts. Well a case could be made that we had. (See first update.)We certainly appreciate all of the commentary we received on this column. Many readers initially were upset that we did not immediately award Pinocchios but now a new wave of readers has condemned us for even thinking this was worthy of serious inquiry. On the last point we respectively disagree. All statements by public figures are subject to scrutiny. The president made an unexpected claim and for nearly a week the White House refused to back it up.So we now have a photo a news report quoting an anonymous source that the president participated in a Marine guard competition and a news report quoting Obama that he has practiced with the Secret Service. The issue is settled and we award the president a Geppetto Checkmark.Geppetto Checkmark(About our rating scale)Check out our candidate Pinocchio TrackerFollow The Fact Checker on Twitter and friend us on Facebook .,1
386,As an “assault weapons” ban seems less likely to even make it to a floor vote President Obama and Democrat lawmakers are increasingly looking to universal background checks as the piece of legislation they can push through the House and Senate.Here’s the problem: Universal background checks are the most insidious of all the gun control measures pushed heretofore. They will rob of us of more freedom than an “assault weapons” ban and a “high capacity” magazine ban combined all in the name of preventing another Sandy Hook shooting. Yet they will actually do nothing to prevent such a shooting. Nothing at all.As David Kopel so ably put it in his Jan. 30 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee universal background checks necessitate a gun registry if they are to be enforceable.Put simply this means that once a universal background state statute is in place the government will require you to register every gun you own–shotguns rifles and handguns–so that they can be sure you do not sell a gun privately.Which brings us to our second point: universal background checks will end private sales period. No more sales to neighbors no more sales between a father and his son or a mother and her daughter. No more sales between friends.Once guns are registered and private sales have been ended the door will be opened for taxes allocated per number of guns owned forced liability insurance payable based on number of guns owned and for outright gun confiscation.The NRA has warned about the confiscation that usually follows registration historically speaking and the Democrats themselves are already promoting per-gun taxes and liability insurance.The bottom line: Universal background checks represent the crest of the hill atop the slippery slope. We must contact our Reps. and Sens. and demand that they say no to this insidious gun control measure.It has nothing to with Sandy Hook Elementary but everything to do with helping Democrats realize their dreams of crushing the 2nd Amendment.,1
387,Barack Obama in an attempt to appear sympathetic to gun owners’ concerns as he pursues a gun-banning agenda in the wake of the Sandy Hook school shooting recently bragged that he goes skeet shooting at Camp David “all the time.”Responding to the blowback from skeptics who doubted Obama was telling the unvarnished truth (Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) challenged Obama to a skeet shooting contest) the White House not only released a photo of Obama shooting skeet but White House press secretary Jay Carney also tried to water down Obama’s statement.Carney claimed Obama had “never pretended to or suggested that he had grown up as a hunter or engaging in sports activities with weapons.” According to the White House spokesman “[Obama] simply said that he had and this is the truth that he had enjoyed shooting at Camp David. That’s a fact.”He went on to explain why the photo had been released while continuing to assert that Obama’s comments about shooting had been entirely unplanned:The fact is the president was asked a question–did not volunteer but was asked a question about whether or not he had ever shot a weapon. He answered with the truth which is that he has enjoyed shooting competitively with friends at Camp David on multiple occasions… there were persistent questions about this and we decided to release a photo of the president shooting at Camp David.Obama told The New Republic that he was a skeet shooter stating “Yes in fact up at Camp David we do skeet shooting all the time. Not the girls but oftentimes guests of mine go up there.”When asked whether Obama liked skeet or trap shooting better Carney replied that Obama “has gotten better” at shooting.,1
388,"By Susan CornwellWASHINGTON Oct 29 (Reuters) - American consumers' initial experience on the Obamacare website Healthcare.gov has been inadequate and unacceptable a key administration official overseeing the troubled launch told a congressional panel on Tuesday.Marilyn Tavenner director of the agency in charge of setting up the online insurance exchanges said the administration was determined to repair the glitches but experts were still diagnosing the problems and have much work ahead.""The initial consumer experience of Healthcare.gov has not lived up to the expectations of the American people and is not acceptable"" Tavenner a former nurse who heads the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said in prepared testimony to the House Ways and Means Committee.""We are committed to fixing these problems as soon as possible"" she said.It has been four weeks since the website at the center of President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law was switched on but it has been plagued by error messages delays and bugs which information technology experts from both the government and private contractors have been scrambling to fix.On Sunday a data center outage prevented Americans from enrolling in the subsidized health insurance provided for under Obama's Affordable Care Act also called Obamacare. The site was back up on Monday.Republicans have seized on the troubled website to further attack Obamacare and question whether administration officials hid problems before the launch. They are expected to press Tavenner on testimony she gave in August when she said work was on track to roll out a tested website that would make it easy for Americans to enroll for insurance.Tavenner said in her testimony for Tuesday that an ""initial wave of interest stressed the account service resulting in many consumers experiencing difficulty signing up while those who were able to sign up sometimes had problems logging in.""She also placed some blame on the contractors helping to build and maintain the website saying a subset of them ""have not met expectations."" She did not name the contractors.A ""new infusion of talent"" has been brought in and experts are working aggressively to diagnose the parts that are still experiencing problems Tavenner said. They are continuing to add capacity and more people are creating accounts she said.""We are pleased with these quick improvements but we know there is still significant additional work to be done"" she said.Tavenner's testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee marks the second congressional hearing to examine the problems with the program's rollout. Last week contractors who worked on the site told a different panel that the administration launched it after only a minimum of system-wide testing.Tavenner 62 was confirmed for her job by the Senate in May. She had been optimistic about the rollout when questioned by lawmakers about it in April and again in August.She is appearing before Congress one day before her boss U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius testifies to Congress on the same subject.With Obama adviser Jeffrey Zients saying Healthcare.gov should be fixed by the end of November experts say the administration could lose the interest of healthy younger adults aged 18-35 for whom the website was seen as a major avenue for enrollment.On Monday the White House issued a report promoting the program for young people. Based partly on Census data it said 46 percent of young adults who live alone in 34 states could get health coverage for $50 a month or less under Obamacare.Republicans in Congress have introduced a flurry of legislation they say is aimed at protecting the public from the problem-plagued rollout.Senators Marco Rubio and Jerry Moran have a bill to delay - until six months after the troubled Healthcare.gov is fully functioning - the mandate requiring most Americans to have health insurance in 2014 or pay a penalty.Fred Upton the Republican chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee has also produced a bill allowing insurers to maintain existing health plans in 2014 outside the new online health insurance exchanges - even if they do not meet the benefit standards of Obamacare.",1
389,Comedy Central’s Jon Stewart spent last week mocking the GOP for opposing Obamacare ignoring legitimate concerns Republicans raised about both the health care legislation itself and its bungled launch.Turns out the funny man did hear the GOP’s complaints.Stewart interviewed Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on Monday’s edition of The Daily Show and he proceeded to both mock and shred her attempt to talk up Obamacare. One almost could feel sorry for an Obama administration official forced to defend the president’s signature train wreck.Stewart kept his clown nose on for the start of their chat to highlight Obamacare’s deeply flawed web component.We’re going to do a challenge” Stewart said at the start of the interview. “I’m going to try and download every movie ever made and you are going to try to sign up for Obamacare — and we’ll see which happens first.Ouch. It was almost as if Jay Leno were sitting in Stewart’s chair for a moment.Stewart wasn’t finished.If I’m an individual that doesn’t want [Obamacare] it would be hard for me to look at a big business getting a waiver and not having to do it and me having to” Stewart said. “Because I would feel like … like you are favoring big business because they lobbied you this year but you’re not allowing individuals that same courtesy.” Sebelius ducked the question and repeated her talking points. She did that a few more times on his follow-ups prompting Stewart to say “Am I a stupid man?No just a comedian who too often defends the president for partisan reasons and mocks the one cable news station–Fox News–which holds Obama’s feet to the fire on the latest headlines.Sadly many young Americans say they get their “news” from Stewart’s Daily Show. If true Millennials got a dose of stone cold reality last night.,1
390,"WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama is expected Monday to address the problem-plagued rollout of his signature health care legislation which has suffered an embarrassing start with a cascade of computer problems plaguing online sign-ups for health insurance.The rough rollout has been a black eye for Obama who invested significant time and political capital in his first term getting the law passed with the goal of insuring millions of Americans without coverage.Administration officials say more than 476000 health insurance applications have been filed through federal and state exchanges. The figures mark the most detailed measure yet of the problem-plagued rollout of the insurance marketplace.However the officials continue to refuse to say how many people have actually enrolled. And without enrolment figures it's unclear whether the program is on track to reach the 7 million people projected to gain coverage during the six-month sign-up period.Administration officials initially blamed a high volume of interest from ordinary Americans for the frozen screens that many people encountered. Since then they have also acknowledged problems with software and some elements of the system's design.The officials said technology experts from inside and outside the government are being brought in to work on the glitches though they did not say how many workers were being added.Officials did say staffing has been increased at call centres by about 50 per cent. As problems persist on the federally run website the administration is encouraging more people to sign up for insurance over the phone.The officials would not discuss the health insurance rollout by name and were granted anonymity.Despite the widespread problems the White House has yet to fully explain what went wrong with the online system consumers were supposed to use to sign up for coverage.Interest in the insurance markets appears to continue to be high. Officials said about 19 million people have visited HealthCare.gov as of Friday night.Story continuesAmericans seeking health coverage through the legislation must fill out applications before selecting a specific plan. The forms require personal information including income figures that are used to calculate any subsidies the applicant may qualify for. More than one person can be included on an application.An internal memo obtained by The Associated Press showed that the administration projected nearly a half million people would enrol for the insurance markets during the first month.Officials say they expect enrollments to be heavier toward the end of the six-month sign up window.Problems with the rollout were largely overshadowed by Republican efforts to force changes to the health care law in exchange for funding the government. That effort failed and the government reopened last week with ""Obamacare"" intact.___Associated Press writer Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar contributed to this report.___Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC",1
391,"Unresolved technical problems on HealthCare.gov could lead to a rude surprise at the doctor's office next month for patients who think they successfully used the website to sign up for health insurance. They may find they're not insured after all.HealthCare.gov the federal online portal for health-insurance shopping in more than 30 states has improved after more than a month of intense fixes and enrollment is accelerating. But insurance companies are still getting information on their would-be customers that is garbled and incomplete and in some cases they are getting no information at all. President Barack Obama's administration is scrambling to repair the faulty system but scant time remains until the Dec. 23 deadline for consumers to choose a health plan that will be in place Jan. 1.The result could be an untold number of consumers remaining uninsured despite completing the enrollment process -- another embarrassing chapter in the rollout of the Affordable Care Act Obama's signature health care reform law.The Obama administration insists the enrollment glitches will be fixed in time to prevent any troubles next month but won't disclose the extent of the problem. Nor will it guarantee that any patients who fall victim to these problems won't be exposed to medical bills if they get sick or injured.""I doubt very seriously the insurance company or the government is going to say 'Oh don't worry We'll take care of it.' I think that's going to fall solely on the patient"" said Reid Blackwelder a doctor in Kingsport Tenn. who is president of the American Academy of Family Physicians. ""I wouldn't count on anybody else jumping in and bailing everybody out.""In an unusual joint press release on Wednesday the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the largest national trade groups for insurers America's Health Insurance Plans and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association emphasized their collaboration in addressing the problem. “Ensuring that all Americans who need coverage are properly enrolled is a top priority for all of us. We are working together closely to resolve back-end issues between health plans and HealthCare.gov"" the statement said. ""We will report on our progress.”Insurance companies could smooth over difficulties during the first month of new coverage by paying the expenses of people who believed they were enrolled. But that would subject the companies to potentially big costs for patients who get expensive services without having yet paid a premium or who may not be their customers at all.Moreover insurers may be reluctant to bear the brunt of another technical failure after having already shouldered responsibility for fixing other Obamacare problems.""You'd be counting on the goodwill of the insurance company. I'm not sure how long that's going to last"" said Leslie Norwalk who was a senior official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President George W. Bush and is now strategic counsel at Epstein Becker Green in Washington.Patients who show up at a doctor's office hospital pharmacy or elsewhere without insurance cards in hand will have to rely on the kindness of those providers Timothy Jost a professor at Washington & Lee University School of Law in Lexington Va. wrote in an email.""It is likely that there will be problems probably a lot of them with confirming coverage but providers are used to dealing with insurer screw-ups and hopefully will be patient"" Jost wrote.HealthCare.gov users who go through the enrollment process to the end are prompted to connect with their new health insurance provider to make payments which are due Dec. 31 for coverage that begins in January. Consumers who don't take action or believe they can wait for a bill from their insurance company could find themselves in the lurch next month especially if the company has no record of their enrollment because of the technical problems.The White House says it is incumbent on individuals to double-check that they have coverage.""If consumers are not sure if they are enrolled they should call our customer call center or the insurer of their choice so that they can be sure they’re covered by Jan. 1"" White House press secretary Jay Carney said Monday. The administration is reaching out by telephone and email to consumers who have begun or submitted applications via HealthCare.gov in order to advise them of the steps they must take to confirm their enrollments.Insurance companies receive daily uploads of data about new enrollees. Despite progress since Obamacare marketplaces launched on Oct. 1 as many as one-third of enrollments submitted through the federal system contain errors The Washington Post reported on Monday.The administration says that error rate isn't accurate but won't reveal how many of the submissions -- called 834 forms -- are incorrect. The White House maintains that most of the problems have already been fixed and that the rest will be resolved in time to prevent hardships next month.The George W. Bush administration faced a similar dilemma in January 2006 when the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit launched. Enrollees across the country visited drugstores only to find their benefits weren't in place.""That was a point of crisis because every one of those became a story"" said Michael Leavitt who was Bush's secretary of Health and Human Services at the time.A frenzied effort to guarantee patients' access to medications followed while the Bush administration worked to correct the technical bugs said Leavitt now chairman of Salt Lake City-based Leavitt Partners a consulting firm that has advised states on ACA implementation. ""It became our problem with the system not the consumer's problem"" Leavitt said.The Obama administration likewise needs to protect patients Leavitt said.""The federal government caused this and they're the ones who are going to have to take responsibility for it"" he said. ""There's an obligation to make certain that people have not been seriously disadvantaged in their health by this.""Unlike during the Medicare Part D snafu the Obama administration has no funding stream to tap to pay for medical expenses incurred by patients who encounter problems. Nevertheless Leavitt predicted his successor Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius would take unilateral action to avoid a backlash as the administration has on previous occasions.""The secretary of health does not lack authority in this situation"" he said. ""I can't tell you the exact authority with which she would act but you just look at the number of things they've already deferred and the way they've found flexibility they're going find the authority.""HuffPost readers: Do you plan to try HealthCare.gov or a state-run health insurance exchange website in December?

393,"Aamer MadhaniUSA TODAYSecretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius will appear before House panel on WednesdayDespite four tough weeks since ACA roll out%2C Sebelius maintains Obama%27s %22full confidence%22Sebelius%27 allies say she is steeled for tough fight with GOPWASHINGTON — Kathleen Sebelius is on the hot seat as the Obama administration battles to rebound from a problem-plagued rollout of the Affordable Care Act but friends of the embattled Health and Human Services secretary say it's a mistake to count her out.In recent days Sebelius has been lampooned by Saturday Night Live and is facing calls from several Republicans to step down because of the bungled roll out of the online exchange.Sebelius is no stranger to difficult fights. During her time as governor in the deep red state of Kansas she had high-profile battles with state GOP lawmakers over her controversial decision to prevent the expansion of a coal plant and her halting of the merger of two of the region's largest health care providers.Despite battles with Republicans on environmental issues education and health policy during her two terms as governor and as Kansas insurance commissioner she left office with an approval rating that hovered near 60%.""She has been successful because she is level-headed"" said Raj Goyle a former Democratic lawmaker in the Kansas Legislature who worked closely with Sebelius when she was governor. ""She's unflappable.""But as Sebelius prepares to appear before a House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday to discuss problems with the exchange she faces the most difficult battle of her career.Republicans have only stepped up their criticism of her in recent days seizing on some of her missteps.Last week at an event to tout the Affordable Care Act in Phoenix she set off a fresh round of GOP criticism after she said those calling for her resignation were ""people who I don't work for and who do not want this program to work in the first place.""Earlier this month she struggled in an interview on the Daily Show with Jon Stewart to explain the problems with the balky website which the White House says will be running at full speed by the end of November. Sen. John Barrasso R-Wyo. this week called Sebelius ""the laughingstock of America.""Sen. Pat Roberts a Republican from her home state of Kansas who stood by her side more than four years ago at a White House ceremony when President Obama announced her nomination was the first lawmaker to call for her resignation.Todd Tiahrt a former GOP congressman from Kansas said that the call for Sebelius' ouster is merited.""Look at a parallel situation in the private sector of a CEO being hired by a board of directors to implement something that they have heavily invested in"" Tiahrt said. ""If it comes to a disaster I would venture to guess that the CEO would immediately be withdrawn and fired. ""Obama who will head to Boston on Wednesday to discuss the problems with health care implementation while she is being grilled has stood by Sebelius. The two have long had a warm relationship dating back to his first presidential campaign where she was an early backer of his run for the White House. Sebelius was also under consideration to be his running mate. White House spokesman Jay Carney has said that Sebelius maintains the president's ""full confidence.""It's not the first time that Obama has stood by Sebelius at a tough moment. Earlier this year the president appeared to publicly signal support for Sebelius after she drew Republican fire for asking health industry officials to make donations to help with the effort to implement the ACA.Soon after reports of the solicitation became public the president invited Sebelius to join him for one of his regular weekend golf outings — an invitation he has only extended to a handful of women during his presidency.Lawmakers outside of Washington have also come to Sebelius' defense. Gov. Steve Beshear the Democratic governor of Kentucky has become one of her most impassioned defenders.""It is so typical of Washington D.C. that when something goes wrong the first thing that the critics do is yell for somebody's firing or yell for somebody's scalp"" Beshear said.Forgotten in all the criticism Beshear said is that there were also problems with the rollout of Medicare in 1960s and more recently with implementation of the prescription drug benefit known as Medicare Part D. In time kinks were worked out and the programs remain popular.During her time in Kansas Sebelius earned a reputation nationally of being a consensus-builder but she had her tough battles with Republicans said Bob Beatty a political scientist at the Washburn University in Kansas.""In Kansas for a Democrat to win you have to have charisma"" Beatty said. ""But her charisma was not loud in the (New Jersey Gov.) Chris Christie sense. Sebelius' charisma came from the ability to ensure voters that she was competent. Perhaps that quieter charisma doesn't play as well in the face of a national problem like this one.""In 2007 while serving as governor of Kansas she made the unprecedented decision to deny a permit for the expansion of a coal power plant based in part on concerns about climate change kicking off a multiyear battle with the GOP-controlled legislature.That same year she ruffled Republicans' feathers when she plainly stated after a devastating tornado all but destroyed the small town of Greensburg Kan. that the recovery response was slow because vital National Guard equipment was tied up by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.Perhaps the moment in her political career most analogous to the battle she now faces was one that dates back to her time as Kansas' insurance commissioner.As the state's top insurance regulator in 2002 she blocked a controversial merger between two health-insurance providers. The for-profit company Anthem wanted to take over Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas the state's non-profit entity that covered roughly 45% of Kansans.For Anthem the private company based in Indiana the merger would have allowed them to spread its risk over a much broader pool of patients. For Blue Cross the takeover would mean that it wouldn't have to insure everybody including risky people with bad health and could be more competitive.Goyle said conventional wisdom at the time dictated that she approve the merger. But Sebelius he said ultimately looked past the political noise and led a deliberative process in which she followed the facts to the ultimate conclusion that the merger would be bad for Kansans.The episode Goyle said underscores why he believes she will ultimately emerge from the controversy over the problems with the online exchange.""The Blue Cross-Anthem situation is really Exhibit A of her ability to stay focused on the facts and the end goal"" Goyle said. ""I do not believe for one second that she's worried about the politics or that she thinks about her own standing.""",1

At the top of the hearing she apologized for the failures of the main ObamaCare website and vowed to fix them.But raising more questions about the administration's transparency on the project she declined to cite enrollment numbers. She did not claim as Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius recently did that officials simply do not have those numbers -- rather she said a ""decision"" was made to release them in mid-November.""We made the decision that we were not releasing the numbers until mid-November"" she said.Rep. Devin Nunes R-Calif. asked again whether she had any idea what the numbers are.More On This...Her answer was the same.""I'll take that as you don't want to answer the question"" Nunes said.Earlier in the hearing Tavenner tried to downplay expectations. Facing ongoing problems with the enrollment website Tavenner told Congress that ""we expect the initial numbers to be small.""An internal memo obtained by The Associated Press shows that the administration expected nearly 500000 people to gain coverage just in October the program's first month. If the administration is short of that target it is unclear by how much.Tavenner though vowed to fix the troubled exchange website by the end of November.""To the millions who have attempted to use HealthCare.gov to shop and enroll in health care coverage I want to apologize to you that the website has not worked as well as it should"" she said. ""We know how desperately you need affordable coverage. I want to assure you that HealthCare.gov can and will be fixed.""The apology would appear to be the first by an administration official.Tavenner's testimony precedes that of Sebelius who is expected to appear before a separate House committee on Wednesday. As Tavenner testified calls were mounting from Republicans for Sebelius to resign.Significantly Sen. Lamar Alexander R-Tenn. speaking on the Senate floor called Tuesday for Sebelius' resignation. Alexander is the top Republican on the Senate health panel.""Mr. President at some point there has to be accountability. Expecting this secretary to be able to fix what she hasn't been able to fix during the last three-and-a-half years is unrealistic"" he said. ""It's throwing good money after bad. It's time for her to resign -- someone else to take charge.""In written testimony released ahead of Wednesday's hearing Sebelius vowed to improve the website and said the consumer experience to date is ""not acceptable."" But she defended the law itself and said extensive work and testing is being done.""We are working to ensure consumers' interaction with HealthCare.gov is a positive one and that the Affordable Care Act fully delivers on its promise"" she said in the prepared remarks.Republicans were also voicing concern Tuesday about Americans being kicked off their current health plans and newly uncovered documents that show the administration anticipated millions might lose their current coverage and be sent into different plans -- despite pledges to the contrary from the White House.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",1
395,Dozens of times (that we know of) over his campaign to pass ObamaCare and to win re-election President Obama lied to the American people about being able to keep the health insurance they like. But that lie has only been replaced with another: the lie that these cancellations will be limited to the 5% of Americans in the individual marketplace — when the truth is that these cancellations have only just begun.Over at National Review in a piece appropriately titled “Lying About Lies” Michael Tanner reports that the same ObamaCare formula currently wiping out the individual market is about to rain hell on the employer-based market. The result will be that tens of millions of policies will be wiped out.This is a secret that is and always has been hiding in plain sight.As far back as last March the media dutifully reported that the CBO reported that these cancellations were coming. So the media knew Obama was lying during the campaign but never said a word to spread this truth — oh except to call Mitt Romney a liar for telling the truth.All these Democrats and members of the elite media now pretending they don’t or didn’t know… Please.Just as the media knew Obama was lying about people in the individual market being able to keep their insurance the media also know that the same apocalypse looms for the employer-based market. It is not conservatives making this estimate it is the Congressional Budget Office. [emphasis mine]But the same conditions that are causing the cancellation of individual policies will eventually result in the cancellation of millions of employment-based policies as well. The only reason that hasn’t happened yet is that the employer mandate was postponed for a year so employer plans don’t yet have to be ACA-compliant. But they will. Even the Congressional Budget Office estimates that as many as 20 million workers will lose their current employer-sponsored plans. Combine that with those losing individual plans and more than 30 million Americans cannot keep their current insurance.ObamaCare’s latest trick is the “junk plan hustle.” Over and over we keep hearing about how our White House overlords are doing Americans a favor by canceling the insurance they like and replacing it with “appropriate” health plans. But most of those plans are not junk plans. That is just another lie the White House is telling and the media are letting them get away with it.The media know the White House is lying about this junk plan nonsense because the ObamaCare guidelines for what isn’t a “junk plan” only includes 2% of the policies currently in existence.According to HealthPocket a health-insurance consulting firm fewer than 2 percent of individual plans on offer today meet all ACA requirements. The most frequent reason for noncompliance was not a failure to cover hospitalization as the administration has suggested but not providing pediatric care including vision and dental care for children. A worthwhile benefit perhaps but if you are childless it’s hard to see how lacking such a benefit makes your policy subpar.This is why other serious think tanks believe that before this nightmare is over up to 93 million people could lose the insurance Obama promised they could keep.In order to buy time Obama Democrats and the media are trying to con the American people into believing that the rolling ObamaCare catastrophe is compartmentalized to just 5% of the population. This conspiracy of silence is all about trying to contain through a lie of omission what is a legitimate reason for the public to panic as soon as they realize that … they are next.Obama is not sorry for lying. And the media are not sorry for covering up that lie for three years.The phase we are in now is nothing more than a 2.0 version of that exact same lie.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC,1
396,"Obamacare has taken a sudden and spectacular dive in public opinion according to a new poll from Gallup. Capitol Hill Democrats are splintering regularly undermining President Obama's tacit demand that they stay united in the bill's defense. What the party wouldn't give for it to be one month ago.On this day in October the roles were flipped. The Obamacare website was a mess and there were reports of people losing their existing coverage but the big story was the shutdown. Democrats stood quietly arm-in-arm watching the Republican Party trip all over itself Three Stooges-style. Now the alliterative mantra of ""Democrats in disarray"" is back and the Republicans are starting to lock arms.The news from Gallup is particularly bad for the Affordable Care Act. Late last month opinion of the bill was about evenly split with 44 percent of Americans supporting it and 47 percent opposing — a 3-point difference. Since that difference has quintupled with only 40 percent of the country supporting the bill and 55 percent opposing. ""Currently 73% of Democrats 39% of independents and 8% of Republicans approve of the healthcare law"" Gallup writes noting the particularly bad news: opinion has dropped among all parties including Democrats. Meanwhile the number of people saying that health care is the country's biggest problem has gone up 7 points since last month — though ""dissatisfaction with government"" continues to lead the way.RELATED: How Democrats Are Trying to Fix But Not Criticize ObamacareMSNBC's Benjy Sarlin points out that Obama has regularly seen stiff opposition to his policy proposals. But Obamacare for several reasons poses a much more severe risk.This time the challenge is much more tangible. Either the exchange works or it doesn’t. Either people getting cancellation notices can find acceptable affordable coverage or they can’t. There’s no messaging substitute for success on either front.Story continuesSo Democrats who The Daily Beast' Michael Tomasky notes aren't exactly known for holding strong in the face of adversity are starting to go sideways. Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu introduced a bill that would allow people to keep their existing health care plans. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin has announced his support for that bill telling Morning Joe that Obamacare has ""more than a roll-out problem. There is a product problem."" Landrieu faces a difficult reelection challenge next year and Manchin represents an increasingly conservative state but they aren't the only ones to bail. Even party-line adherents like California Sen. Dianne Feinstein are calling for some sort of legislative response.We noted earlier this week why such a fix is tricky threatening the economics that are supposed to make Obamacare work for the private sector. At New York Jonathan Chait outlines why such changes are tricky. But politics has a habit of getting in the way of (both parties') best-laid plans. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told participants in The Atlantic's Washington Ideas Forum on Thursday morning that she expected an announcement from the president in support of a fix at some point today.RELATED: Some Democrats Back Delay of Obamacare Mandate Enrollment May Be ExtendedMichigan Rep. Fred Upton has introduced a bill in the House that like Landrieu's would allow people to keep their plans but only for a period of two years. If both pass there could be a conference committee to work out a compromise. The Republicans could say that they'd helped Americans worried about coverage — but as The Atlantic's Molly Ball points out inadvertently take ownership over the program perhaps even saving it from political backlash. It's not a possibility Democrats are embracing: Pelosi called the Upton vote the 46th vote for repeal and the administration opposes the Upton bill saying that it undermines ""the central promise of the Affordable Care Act.""In general though the Republicans are just trying to clear all of their members from the tracks as the Obamacare train rumbles haphazardly along. Politico suggests that the party found ""political gold"" in the issue — as long as it holds its natural inclination to overreach in check.RELATED: How Real Live Young People Feel About the Obamacare Outreach EffortThey will pass Obamacare-related bills when opportunities arise — like [Upton's] this week — but Rep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio) neatly encapsulated the party’s emerging strategy: “We should be just like a doctor and do no harm.” “Obamacare is the gift that keeps on giving” a senior House aide said on condition of anonymity. “We just need to keep out of the way.”If that's the strategy this bit of news from the Washington Examiner can't be welcome: ""Ted Cruz previews new plan to repeal and replace Obamacare."" Cruz of course initiated the government shutdown at the beginning of October that put the Republicans on defense for several weeks and deeply undermined their popularity. The party greatly prefers the position they're in this month.This article was originally published at http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2013/11/obamacare-ruined-republicans-october-and-democrats-november/71591/Read more from The Atlantic Wire• The Two Scenarios That Would Have Improved the Obamacare Launch",1
397,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Crammed into conference rooms with pizza for dinner some programmers building the Obama administration's showcase health insurance website were growing increasingly stressed. Some worked past 10 p.m. energy drinks in hand. Others rewrote computer code over and over to meet what they considered last-minute requests for changes from the government or other contractors.As questions mount over the website's failure insider interviews and a review of technical specifications by The Associated Press found a mind-numbingly complex system put together by harried programmers who pushed out a final product that congressional investigators said was tested by the government and not private developers with more expertise.Meanwhile the White House said that President Barack Obama's longtime adviser Jeffrey Zients will provide management advice to help fix the system. White House press secretary Jay Carney says Zients will be on a short-term assignment at the Health and Human Services Department before he's due to take over as director of Obama's National Economic Council Jan. 1.Carney cited Zients' expertise as a longtime management consultant and his ""proven track record"" since coming to the White House in 2009 both as interim budget director and as chief performance officer when he headed an effort to streamline government and cut costs. ""We're engaged in an all-out effort to improve the online experience"" Carney said.This is not the first time Obama has turned to Zients for help solving a major problem. In the 2009 after far more drivers than anticipated signed up for the Cash for Clunkers program that promised rebates to people who traded in their old cars for more fuel-efficient vehicles Obama assigned Zients his deputy budget director at the time to help eliminate the backlog.When the same thing happened with sign-ups for an updated version of the GI Bill one designed to help the 9/11 generation of veterans get a college education Obama again turned to Zients.Story continues""He's not going to be looking under the hood and tell you 'I can fix the coding I can fix it'"" Kenneth Baer who was a senior adviser to Zients at the budget office said of Zients' newest assignment. ""His skill is going to be how to identify challenges prioritize what solutions need to be done next assessing what talent is already available and then how to motivate them to do that job as quickly and as ably as possible.""Aneesh Chopra who was Obama's chief technology officer said Zients is extremely skilled in figuring things out from a management perspective.""If I was confident this issue would be resolved before his participation I am doubly so now"" said Chopra who also worked with Zients at the Advisory Board Co. one of two business advisory firms where Zients held top posts. ""Jeff's track record is really a relentless focus on execution.""Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a post on HealthCare.gov that her agency is also bringing in more experts and specialists from government and industry including top Silicon Valley companies.""This new infusion of talent will bring a powerful array of subject matter expertise and skills including extensive experience scaling major IT systems"" she said. ""This effort is being marshaled as part of a cross-functional team that is working aggressively to diagnose parts of HealthCare.gov that are experiencing problems learn from successful states prioritize issues and fix them.""Project developers for the health care website who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity — because they feared they would otherwise be fired — said they raised doubts among themselves whether the website could be ready in time. They complained openly to each other about what they considered tight and unrealistic deadlines. One was nearly brought to tears over the stress of finishing on time one developer said. Website builders saw red flags for months.A review of internal architectural diagrams obtained by the AP revealed the system's complexity. Insurance applicants have a host of personal information verified including income and immigration status. The system connects to other federal computer networks including ones at the Social Security Administration IRS Veterans Administration Office of Personnel Management and the Peace Corps.Obama on Monday acknowledged technical problems that he described as ""kinks in the system."" But in remarks at a Rose Garden event Obama offered no explanation for the failure except to note that high traffic to the website caused some of the slowdowns. He said it had been visited nearly 20 million times — fewer monthly visits so far than many commercial websites such as PayPal AOL Wikipedia or Pinterest.""The problem has been that the website that's supposed to make it easy to apply for and purchase the insurance is not working the way it should for everybody"" Obama said. ""There's no sugarcoating it. The website has been too slow. People have been getting stuck during the application process. And I think it's fair to say that nobody is more frustrated by that than I am.""The online system was envisioned as a simple way for people without health insurance to comparison-shop among competing plans offered in their state pick their preferred level of coverage and cost and sign up. For many it's not worked out that way so far.Just weeks before the launch of HealthCare.gov on Oct. 1 one programmer said colleagues huddled in conference rooms trying to patch ""bugs"" or deficiencies in computer code. Unresolved problems led to visitors experiencing cryptic error messages or enduring long waits trying to sign up.Congressional investigators have concluded that the government's Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services not private software developers tested the exchange's computer systems during the final weeks. That task known as integration testing is usually handled by software companies because it ferrets out problems before the public sees the final product.The government spent at least $394 million in contracts to build the federal health care exchange and the data hub. Those contracts included major awards to Virginia-based CGI Federal Inc. Maryland-based Quality Software Services Inc. and Booz Allen Hamilton Inc.CGI Federal said in a statement Monday it was working with the government and other contractors ""around the clock"" to improve the system which it called ""complex ambitious and unprecedented.""The schematics from late 2012 show how officials designated a ""data services hub"" — a traffic cop for managing information — in lieu of a design that would have allowed state exchanges to connect directly to government servers when verifying an applicant's information. On Sunday the Health and Human Services Department said the data hub was working but not meeting public expectations: ""We are committed to doing better.""Administration officials so far have refused to say how many people actually have managed to enroll in insurance during the three weeks since the new marketplaces became available. Without enrollment numbers it's impossible to know whether the program is on track to reach projections from the Congressional Budget Office that 7 million people would gain coverage during the first year the exchanges were available.Instead officials have selectively cited figures that put the insurance exchanges in a positive light. They say more than 19 million people have logged on to the federal website and nearly 500000 have filled out applications for insurance through both the federal and state-run sites.The flood of computer problems since the website went online has been deeply embarrassing for the White House. The snags have called into question whether the administration is capable of implementing the complex policy and why senior administration officials — including the president — appear to have been unaware of the scope of the problems when the exchange sites opened.Even as the president spoke at the Rose Garden more problems were coming to light. The administration acknowledged that a planned upgrade to the website had been postponed indefinitely and that online Spanish-language signups would remain unavailable despite a promise to Hispanic groups that the capability would start this week. And the government tweaked the website's home page so visitors can now view phone numbers to apply the old-fashioned way or window-shop for insurance rates without registering first.The House Energy and Commerce Committee was expected to conduct an oversight hearing Thursday probably without Sebelius testifying. She could testify on Capitol Hill on the subject as early as next week.Uninsured Americans have until about mid-February to sign up for coverage if they are to meet the law's requirement that they be insured by the end of March. If they don't they will face a penalty. The administration says it's working to address the timing issue to provide more flexibility.Sen. Marco Rubio R-Fla. plans to introduce legislation to delay that requirement because: ""It's not fair to punish people for not buying something that's not available"" Rubio told ""CBS This Morning"" on Tuesday.Citing the website problems Sen. Jeanne Shaheen D-N.H. also urged the White House to extend the open enrollment period past March 31 2014.In a letter Tuesday to Obama Shaheen suggested extending open enrollment to ""provide greater flexibility for the American people seeking to access health insurance"" according to an emailed statement from her office. Shaheen also asked the White House to clarify how the ""individual responsibility penalty will be administered and enforced"" in light of the website's difficulties.On Monday the White House advised people frustrated by the online tangle that they can enroll by calling 1-800-318-2596 in a process that should take 25 minutes for an individual or 45 minutes for a family. Assistance is also available in communities from helpers who can be found at LocalHelp.HealthCare.gov.___Associated Press writers Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar and Darlene Superville contributed to this report.___Follow Jack Gillum on Twitter at http://twitter.com/jackgillum or Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC.",1
398,"At best President Obama's proposed health care “fix” offers political protection for vulnerable lawmakers. That's because beyond giving insurance companies permission to continue offering individual health care plans that don't comply with the Affordable Care Act the president's fix doesn't compel anyone to do anything.So why even propose such a fix and especially a remedy that according insurance experts could lead to more expensive premiums for the people the fix is supposed to help?As Kaiser Family Foundation Vice President Larry Levitt explained to Yahoo News the best ""fix"" supporters of the Affordable Care Act could offer is to simply let the current process play out.""From the perspective of keeping the market stable and premiums down a quicker transition to new coverage is the best approach"" Levitt said. ""Any plan that allows individuals to keep their old policies will tend to raise costs and raise premiums.”In other words according to Levitt and other experts Obama's proposed fix offers little in the way of actual help to consumers or even insurance providers.What it does do is provide Obama (and by extension the Democrats in Congress) a scapegoat and a much-needed short-term political gain.""This doesn't change anything other than force insurers to be the political flack jackets for the administration"" an insurance industry insider told Buzzfeed. ""So now when we don't offer these policies the White House can say it's the insurers doing this and not being flexible.""The president's proposal creates a number of challenges. For example insurers are not actually required to restore canceled plans. And if consumers keep their less expensive plans it will almost certainly drive up costs for those who are buying plans from the health care exchanges.""If due to these changes fewer younger and healthier people choose to purchase coverage in the exchange premiums will increase in the marketplace and there will be fewer choices for consumers"" Karen Ignagni chief executive of America's Health Insurance Plans a leading organization of insurance providers said in a statement.Story continuesLevitt adds that it will be ""complex but not impossible"" for insurers to reverse course on canceled plans. But while that course is theoretically possible the insurers have little incentive to reverse course and ""throw a wrench in the works in the bottom half of the 9th inning"" as Levitt described it.""It is unclear how as a practical matter the changes proposed today by the president can be put into effect"" said Jim Donelon president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and Louisiana Insurance commissioner. ""In many states cancellation notices have already gone out to policyholders and rates and plans have already been approved for 2014. Changing the rules through administrative action at this late date creates uncertainty and may not address the underlying issues.""Regardless of whether the president's fix does anything to actually help consumers you can almost certainly expect more political fixes to be offered before the January 2014 deadline for all Americans to be insured goes into effect.Republicans in the House are gearing up to consider a bill by Fred Upton R-Mich. that would allow insurers to continue to offer non-ACA compliant plans on a yearly basis while a potential Democratic bill in the Senate would require insurers to continue these plans.House Speaker John Boehner said he plans to go forward with a Friday vote on the Upton bill. When asked if Democrats in the House would propose their own legislative fix Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters ""We'll do what we have to do.""""My guess is that because the House and Senate proposals all go further in their own way I would expect that they would stick around for awhile"" Levitt said.",1
399,"The president may be vacationing in a tropical paradise but there's no escaping the buffeting winds of troubled state health insurance exchanges even in Hawaii.For openers the botched roll-out of the ObamaCare state exchange in Hawaii has hurt Democratic Gov. Neil Abercrombie's approval ratings: 51 percent of likely Democratic primary voters say they don't like the way he's doing his job.Already out of a job is Coral Andrews the executive director of Hawaii's state-run exchange. She submitted her resignation effective December 6 after only 257 people had signed up for health care a month into the roll out.Hawaii's website contract was awarded to the same firm CGI that blew the national Healthcare.gov roll out. CGI won the Hawaii contract even after the state senate president warned the state exchange director not to hire the firm. CGI apparently also had botched Hawaii's tax website costing Hawaiians $50 million to fix.Hawaii is not alone. Oregon's website never has worked despite that state receiving more exchange grant money than any others except California and New York.Oregon applicants are forced to fill out a 19-page paper form but that too has been problematic. Despite assurances that coverage would take effect January 1 late this month applicants began receiving robo-calls in which a voice told the applicant ""If you have not heard from us by December 23rd it is unlikely your application can be processed for January 1st insurance coverage.""Oregonian Harold Stanton received one of those calls and is no longer sure whether his health care insurance is effective come January 1.""The governor should have been apprised of the situation. If he wasn't apprised of the situation then shame on his aides and if he was then shame on him for not listening to his aides"" he says.The director of Oregon’s exchange is now on medical leave.Maryland home to presumed Democratic presidential contender Gov. Martin O'Malley also had a bad roll out.Its exchange director is now gone but lingering animosities remain. Gubernatorial hopeful Attorney General Doug Gansler fired off an intra-party salvo when he said the roll out was akin to a ""Saturday Night Live skit."" The object of his wrath is lieutenant governor and gubernatorial front-runner Anthony Brown who is also the chairman of the state panel on the health care roll out.California has been touted as a state exchange success story. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi recently said of her state’s exchange ""In Covered California we're moving along (the) largest state in the union rolling along in a very positive way on it.""But what she did not say was that the state’s enrollment among Latinos has been weak.Only five percent of enrollees are Latino even though they make up more than half of California's uninsured.In a conference call with reporters Monday Pelosi said the ""transformational"" nature of ObamaCare much like Social Security means that the law will take time to work out.She added ""It's going to be a glorious thing.""",0
400,More and more Americans are beginning to realize that they were sold Obamacare on false pretenses. What they are getting in the mail isn’t what they ordered.Those responsible for saddling the country with this law including the law’s chief salesman President Obama are scrambling to dodge the hammer of growing public resentment over the bill of goods that they have sold the American people. They are coming up with “fixes” but I caution the buyer beware.The president along with members of his party who are facing elections soon are busy campaigning for proposals they say do what these architects of the law promised in the first place. But folks should think carefully about relying on the same people who repeatedly promised one thing and delivered something far different. Consumers who liked their health care plans are being forced to give them up. People who were told they would pay less for health care will be paying more. Even fans of Obamacare are upset with an archaic ready-fire-aim website that took years and millions of dollars to develop but to put it mildly is failing miserably. Will Americans again put their faith in the leaders who said the law had to be passed before it was understood? They shouldn’t.In 2010 on the Senate floor I warned that rules published in the Federal Register would guarantee that people who liked their health care would lose it. I warned that health care costs would go up. I warned that employers would be forced to cut back worker hours and jobs. I did more than warn this would happen I offered senators a chance to prevent these calamities. Proponents of Obamacare rejected and ridiculed my legislation.These same folks now fighting for their political lives are offering patches for their program and excuses for why it isn’t working. However these folks are the same people who created the problems in the first place. They simply don’t want you to be able to choose the health insurance you want unless it’s health insurance they think you should have. They never did. Their plan was and is for policy makers in Washington to make what the experts believe are the best choices for you.The Washington Post reported recently that the president said his administration could not in good faith allow people with inferior insurance plans to keep them. That’s not what he said dozens of times before the law passed and it doesn’t sound like a person ready to fix a problem. This isn’t about a fumbled roll-out or a computer glitch. This law’s problems are inherent within it. The way to get our country out of this bad situation is with the earnest help of people who recognize the benefit of individuals being able to make their own choices.I’m a cosponsor of Senator Ron Johnson’s (R-Wis.) “If You Like Your Health Plan You Can Keep it Act”. The House passed a bill that would allow insurers to continue offering policies that don’t meet the expensive Obamacare mandates. So far we haven’t received much positive feedback from the president or majority in the Senate. Instead the president announced another exception to a law that is already riddled with them while the Senate majority proposes more federal mandates to “fix” the mandates they already have imposed on America. But as the Wall Street Journal has pointed out there is a real difference between letting people keep their plans by unshackling them from federal rules and working with state frameworks versus forcing insurers to comply with more new requirements.My dad used to say that if you keep on doing what you’ve been doing you are going to end up with what you’ve got. I’ve heard the Senate majority leader say the definition of insanity is continuing to do the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. Unless people demand a new approach to health care — bona-fide inclusion of ideas from those who want a new approach — then we’re going to end up with what we have now: broken promises. We can do better.,1
401,"I had been banking on being able to finally get health care starting January 1 2014. Three days over the past few years have been especially meaningful (after of course Election Night '08 and the January 2009 inauguration): the day the PPACA law passed the day the SCOTUS mostly upheld it and this past Election Day (which seemed to seal its prospects against ever being repealed though at the moment I'm less sure of that).My wife works as a primary school special ed teacher. Her job provides decent insurance for her with no premium. To add me and our kids to the policy though would cost $577 a month out of a paycheck that right now is only $2400 a month take home and does not stretch super far as it is. This is just plain unaffordable for us. Yet the news is we are shit out of luck.Almost insulting are the paltry breadcrumbs found in the ""silver lining"":Under the law people who go without insurance will generally be subject to tax penalties. In a separate proposed regulation issued on Wednesday the Internal Revenue Service said that the uninsured children and spouse of an employee would be exempt from the penalties if the cost of coverage for the entire family under an employer’s plan was more than 8 percent of household income.So rather than helping me get my family covered you just won't punish us because we can't afford it? Thank you Obama.As someone pithily put it on the SDMB thread I coincidentally started the day before this news came out (because I was trying to figure out where we stood vis-a-vis the law):This will be comforting to Tea Party paranoiacs I suppose. To me? Not so much.The same commenter wrote:Democrats had better be careful. It looks like the Pubs might be right on what a clusterfuck this will be.Indeed. I am beyond livid here...despairing really. How can this be happening?!?Our total gross income is $46000 about 200 percent of the FPL so no dice on the Medicaid expansion. The truly perverse part is that if my wife's job had no health insurance at all we could all get on the exchange for just over $200 a month total.I may actually have to consider divorcing her as my own income is less than the threshold to get the Medicaid expansion (if my reddish state joins that) or at least get a cheap policy from the federal exchange. Not exactly a pro-marriage policy though!Anyone who might doubt me when I say essentially that if they are losing ME of all people they are really screwing the pooch just take a quick peek at this diary I wrote a year and a half ago:http://www.dailykos.com/...",1
402,"WASHINGTON — He’s vented attacked apologized and adjusted. Now President Obama has one move left in his attempt to salvage the rollout of his healthcare law: hope the website works soon.The White House knowing a functional website is needed to calm its panicky allies has now entered the wait-and-see period of its triage after the turmoil that has followed the Oct. 1 rollout. With the latest fix to the law unveiled a bruising House vote behind them and experts working feverishly on the broken website administration officials believe they may have weathered the worst.Although Obama’s standing in polls and support within his party have dropped sharply much like the downward trajectory of George W. Bush’s second term White House officials believe he can still recover.That optimistic assessment depends almost entirely on the administration’s ability to reboot healthcare.gov the once-hyped online insurance marketplace now undergoing extensive repair. At stake are the future of the president’s signature domestic achievement his political standing and reelection prospects for vulnerable Democrats in Congress.AdvertisementIf the administration meets its goal of a mostly glitch-free site by the end of November the last two months may be remembered as just another near-death experience for a healthcare overhaul that has had many. Even though many insurance executives and congressional Democrats are angry at Obama for his handling of the healthcare law both groups have strong incentives to help the Affordable Care Act succeed.But if the White House fails the recent setbacks could become the beginning of years of trouble for Democrats in office as well as those seeking to get there officials concede.Administration officials privately acknowledge that no argument defending Obamacare will connect with Americans until they begin to see the effects of the law at work. No work-around or temporary fix will reach enough people to build a critical mass of support. The website has to function admit edgy aides who sometimes spit the word “website” with the contempt familiar to anyone who has ever called a tech help desk.Obama revealed his own frustrations Thursday saying at a White House news conference that he has an obligation to show Americans that the law has made health insurance more affordable and accessible — “if we can just get the darn website working and smooth this thing out.”AdvertisementOfficials said Friday they were making progress on the site’s many glitches and bugs. It now takes less than one second on average to load a page down from eight seconds in the weeks after the launch said Jeffrey Zients a former top administration official who was brought back to oversee the repairs. The site can “comfortably” handle 20000 to 25000 consumers at the same time and more capacity is being added he said.Still problems persist in the system that sends consumer information to insurers and as experts have ticked off 200 software problems more continue to pop up. Zients said the officials expect to make the Nov. 30 goal but added: “Not all consumers going on the website will have a seamless experience.”While the tech team works the president must convince his allies as well as his potential adversaries that as he said Thursday he’s a clutch player who knows how to recover from a fumble.That group includes insurance executives who were called to the White House on Friday to discuss Obama’s answer to the millions of policy cancellation notices sent to surprised consumers. After announcing Thursday that he would allow insurers to rescind those cancellations and extend the policies for another year the president sought to persuade the executives to take him up on the offer.AdvertisementThe group also includes Democrats on Capitol Hill many of whom have gone from disgruntled to distrustful of the White House. On Friday 39 House Democrats voted for the GOP alternative to Obama’s extension fix.That sizable number of largely swing-district lawmakers was only the most visible sign of broader dissatisfaction that makes Obama’s current holding pattern a challenge. Even those who stuck with the White House on Friday’s vote have expressed frustration. In the wake of Obama’s announcement lawmakers were left to figure out whether their state officials and insurers would go along with the plan. Skepticism was high.“The message from the White House is ‘OK you can be mad it’s frustrating. But be on the program’” said one advisor to a House Democrat who asked for anonymity while characterizing internal discussions. “But what program is that? The program where every five minutes there’s a different plan?”Polling shows the public has similar doubts. For the first time in his presidency fewer than half of Americans polled told Gallup that Obama was a “strong and decisive leader” a 6-percentage-point drop since September. The perception of Obama as “honest and trustworthy” and public confidence in his ability to manage government took a similar tumble.AdvertisementA continued slide combined with continued technical glitches could leave the White House little choice but to make additional changes to the law — mostly likely extending the enrollment period and delaying the penalties for people who don’t carry insurance. Senate Democrats already have urged such a move.But in the face of ardent Republican opposition to the law — House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) on Friday repeated his hope to repeal “this train wreck” — the White House has resisted any fix that puts it at the mercy of House Republicans and pushes votes on the law well into an election year.“That will always be an option of extreme last resort” said Drew Altman president and chief executive of the Kaiser Family Foundation.The White House has long argued that the popularity of the healthcare law will hinge on the popularity of its benefits — an untested theory until the public can easily access the online marketplaces that showcase most of those benefits. Still in the pileup of bad news for Obama there was some reason to hope that the policy now largely locked behind the broken site might have a chance of winning over the public.AdvertisementThough enrollment numbers in October were dismal consumer interest was strong. Nationwide more than 1.1 million people completed applications to get coverage; 106000 actually selected a plan.Data from several states operating their own marketplaces suggest demand for health plans may be accelerating.In California 35000 people selected a health plan in October. Nearly the same number signed up in just the first two weeks of November according to Covered California the state’s marketplace. Kentucky has seen similar growth: 5586 people signed up in October and nearly 4000 did in the first two weeks of November.“We are feeling incredibly optimistic” said Gwenda Bond a spokeswoman for the state health agency that operates Kentucky’s marketplace known as kynect.AdvertisementThe White House may have a long wait Altman noted before it knows how far that optimism will spread.“In the long term ultimately the website will be working this issue of cancellations will be in the rear-view mirror and the real question will be whether people who get coverage under the law like it or not” Altman said. “The real story about whether the law works or not will unfold next year and the year after that.”kathleen.hennessey@latimes.comchristi.parsons@latimes.comAdvertisementTimes staff writer Noam N.

403,WASHINGTON — Despite the disastrous rollout of the federal government’s healthcare website enrollment is surging in many states as tens of thousands of consumers sign up for insurance plans made available by President Obama’s health law.A number of states that use their own systems including California are on track to hit enrollment targets for 2014 because of a sharp increase in November according to state officials.“What we are seeing is incredible momentum” said Peter Lee director of Covered California the nation’s largest state insurance marketplace which accounted for a third of all enrollments nationally in October. California — which enrolled about 31000 people in health plans last month — nearly doubled that in the first two weeks of this month.Several other states including Connecticut and Kentucky are outpacing their enrollment estimates even as states that depend on the federal website lag far behind. In Minnesota enrollment in the second half of October ran at triple the rate of the first half officials said. Washington state is also on track to easily exceed its October enrollment figure officials said.AdvertisementPHOTOS: 2013’s memorable political momentsThe growing enrollment in those states is a rare bit of good news for backers of the Affordable Care Act and suggests that the serious problems with the law’s rollout may not be fatal despite critics’ renewed calls for repeal.But the trend also emphasizes how widely experience with the new law varies by location.Fourteen states and the District of Columbia covering about one-third of the nation’s population are operating their own Obamacare marketplaces and have their own enrollment websites. The others including most states with Republican-led governments have declined to do so making their residents dependent on the malfunctioning federal site.AdvertisementIn addition to better-functioning websites many states that are running their own marketplaces also have significantly more resources to help consumers sign up for coverage.Many of the states that have declined to run their own websites have also refused to expand the joint federal-state Medicaid program as the new law allows.Overall enrollment totals in states using the federal site were dismal in October according to figures released last week by the Health and Human Services Department.For example just 2991 people successfully enrolled in health plans in Texas in October. That was fewer enrollees than in Kentucky which has a sixth as many residents.AdvertisementAltogether 106000 people enrolled in health coverage nationwide last month a figure far below administration projections.Nearly half of those who enrolled in October were in California or New York. Both states have continued to show growth in their numbers. In New York enrollment has continued at roughly October’s rate and stands at 24509 according to state officials.PHOTOS: The battle over ObamacareEven with the growing consumer interest in health insurance in many states the new marketplaces created by the health law need millions more enrollees. The Obama administration aims to get 7 million consumers into health insurance plans in 2014 to ensure that the marketplaces have enough people to be sustainable.AdvertisementWith fixes still being made to the federal website it is unclear whether enrollment will catch up everywhere.White House officials repeatedly have said they hope to have the healthcare.gov website working for the “vast majority” of users by the end of this month. But spokesman Jay Carney said Monday that the administration also is working with insurance companies to allow consumers to bypass the troubled site and enroll directly with insurers.In California Lee said Monday that the federal troubles have made enrollment more difficult even for states that use their own sites. State officials believe enrollment through Covered California has been depressed by media reports of problems with the federal site Lee told reporters during a call organized by the consumer group Families USA.Covered California has had to change its marketing strategy to remind Californians that the state website is different from healthcare.gov.AdvertisementBut while politicians in Washington D.C. have been fixated on the website problems many state officials are feeling considerably more optimistic about the law’s long-term prospects.“We’re going to ride all this stuff out” said Kevin Counihan chief executive of Access Health CT Connecticut’s marketplace.Counihan who worked for the marketplace that Massachusetts created after its trailblazing 2006 reforms said he had been expecting even lower enrollment. Connecticut saw growing enrollment in November: 3201 people signed up for health plans in the first two weeks of this month nearing the 4371 total for all of October.Enrollment has been even stronger in many Medicaid programs.AdvertisementAbout half the states have agreed to expand their Medicaid programs to most low-income residents in 2014. Under the law the federal government picks up nearly the entire cost of that expansion for the first several years.Nationwide nearly 400000 new people qualified for Medicaid coverage in October according to federal data. In Oregon whose marketplace has been one of the few trouble-plagued state sites the state reported that it had already signed up 70000 new people for Medicaid.Officials nationwide cautioned that drawing firm conclusions about enrollment patterns was difficult at this early stage.“It’s hard to know what normal looks like yet” said Bethany Frey a spokeswoman for Washington state’s marketplace known as Washington Healthplanfinder.AdvertisementMany state officials say they think the biggest enrollment surge will take place after Thanksgiving. Consumers face a Dec. 15 deadline to sign up if coverage is to be effective Jan. 1.The open enrollment period under the law lasts until March 31 giving consumers an additional three months to select health plans in 2014.Experts also expect more people to sign up for coverage through 2014 as their circumstances change in ways that make them eligible to enroll outside of the regular enrollment period.“We are in the beginning of the first inning of a nine-inning game” Lee said.Advertisementnoam.levey@latimes.comKathleen Hennessey in the Washington bureau contributed to the report.,1
404,I love a defunding fight as much as anyone but I really want to see ObamaCare get a stake through its heart via widespread civil disobedience. If people refuse to sign up for ObamaCare the program collapses. Nothing would be more satisfying than to see ObamaCare go the way of Prohibition (without the violence): as something else that pushed the wonderfully unruly American people too far.Contrary to what the media are telling you the shutdown is not helping ObamaCare. Again and again conservatives have been taunted by the media with the cry of “If you hadn’t shut down the government we’d be covering the ObamaCare launch debacle.”Huh?The media are covering the ObamaCare launch debacle and the coverage is the Obama administration’s worst nightmare because the shutdown has made it impossible for the White House to come up with a plan that would instruct the media in how to mitigate the damage.You see if there was no shutdown the media coverage of the launch would not be anywhere as negative for the White House as it is now and here is why…1. The White House Can’t Do Damage Control – Right now the media and the White House are covering the ObamaCare launch debacle in stark one-dimensional terms: It is an expensive disappointing big government debacle. Both are too overwhelmed to figure out a way to make it look less worse which we all know would happen if they had the time and resources.2. The White House Can’t Gameplan a Plan B – While the administration obviously bungled the launch when it comes to cleaning up a mess this White House can usually move pretty fast. This time the White House can’t. They and the media are too bogged down in the shutdown. With some breathing room the White House might have been able to set up a massive call center staffed with volunteers — something anything to get people signed up. But even if they do there is just no media space available to spread the word.3. White House Can’t Reassure Anyone – If the shutdown wasn’t gobbling up White House resources and media space the administration could fan out its supporters to reassure those interested in signing up for ObamaCare that things are going to get better and that the problems are aggressively being worked on. Instead all potential enrollees are seeing is error messages and all they are hearing is bad news.4. White House Can’t Spin the Sticker Shock – If anything brings down ObamaCare it will be sticker shock. For four years Obama Democrats and the media have been lying to the American people about the cost of ObamaCare. On top of adding $2.6 trillion to our deficit individuals are facing shockingly high premiums and premium increases. This after being lied to again and again about cheaper premiums. I’m not sure how the White House and its media would spin their way out of this but heaven knows if they had the time and resources they would find a way. After all this is the same media that turned Obama’s Libya debacle into a campaign problem for Mitt Romney.—The bottom line to ObamaCare’s success or failure is the number of enrollees paying into the system. In its first year ObamaCare needs seven million enrollees three million of them healthy and under age 35.If those numbers aren’t met the program is a failure the disapproval ratings increase and the chances of ObamaCare slowly being killed increase.ObamaCare is the president’s baby his only significant accomplishment his only hope for a legacy — it is burning down before his eyes and he is helpless to do anything to shape the all-important first impression.Throughout Obama’s time in the spotlight this is the only time I have ever witnessed anything he has bungled receiving only harshly negative coverage. It’s a bloodbath because the shutdown is taking up all the space that would normally be used for spin and lies.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC,1
405,WASHINGTON — As the pitchman for his landmark healthcare law President Obama promised to make buying insurance as easy as buying a plane ticket online or a “TV on Amazon.” It would be simple he said.If there were problems the president predicted they would be “glitches.”And he said “If you like the plan you have you can keep it.”Such claims have come back to haunt the president and his allies less than a month into the launch of the online insurance marketplaces at the heart of his healthcare legislation. With the federal website hobbled by bad design and thousands of policyholders receiving cancellation notices Obama’s promises are not being met — prompting charges of deception from some Republicans and concessions from some allies that elements of the law were oversold.AdvertisementThe fallout is only the latest chapter in this White House’s three-year struggle to sell the public on the Affordable Care Act which could come to define the president’s legacy. Since signing it into law the president has variously defended it promoted it simplified it and hyped it. But polling shows he has never fully sold nor educated the public on the vast new government healthcare program.PHOTOS: 2013’s memorable political momentsPublicly the White House continued Tuesday to defend the president’s pre-launch salesmanship.“The purpose here wasn’t to do anything beyond encourage people to make themselves aware of the options available to them” White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said.AdvertisementBehind closed doors some officials who worked on the rollout say they wish they’d left themselves a little wiggle room. They could have done more to play up ways to sign up other than through the website such as the call centers said one official requesting anonymity to discuss the planning process.After taking heat from allies for not finding a crisp way to explain the complex law the White House tried to boil it down to its simplest elements the official said and some nuance was inevitably lost.The first administration official to testify before Congress on the matter apologized Tuesday saying “the website has not worked as well as it should.”“This initial experience has not lived up to our expectations or the expectations of the American people and it is not acceptable” Marilyn Tavenner the head of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told the House Ways and Means Committee.AdvertisementTavenner’s agency oversaw the development of the site intended to link consumers with affordable private health insurance plans that meet standards outlined in the 2010 law. Tavenner vowed that the site would be running smoothly by the end of November in time for consumers to enroll before the new year.But for the first time since the Oct. 1 launch criticism of the administration moved well beyond the website’s technical troubles. Hundreds of thousands of people who buy insurance on the individual market have received notices that their policies will be canceled or amended — and their premiums on new policies could rise.PHOTOS: The battle over ObamacareThe notices are a result of provisions in the law that created new minimum requirements for health insurance coverage sold in the individual market. Under the Affordable Care Act policies sold or renewed after Jan. 1 must cover maternity care and mental health. They cannot deny coverage because of preexisting conditions or charge higher premiums based on gender. Plans that don’t meet such standards are grandfathered in — but only if they were bought before the law was signed in March 2010 and have not changed since that time.AdvertisementFor experts these adjustments were a long-expected outcome of the law’s attempt to regulate a market that some argue offered shoddy coverage and kept premiums low by discriminating against sick people. Roughly 5% of the population — or about 15 million people — buy plans on the individual market.“It was always expected that once the clock struck midnight on Dec. 31 that the rules of the game in the individual insurance market would change and that meant that policies sold under the old rules could no longer be offered” said Larry Levitt a senior vice president and health policy expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation.Although experts on the law expected the changes for that slice of Americans the White House and the president continued to insist otherwise.In June 2012 the president made that his first point in comments on the Supreme Court’s decision affirming the law. “First if you’re one of the more than 250 million Americans who already have health insurance you will keep your health insurance — this law will only make it more secure and more affordable” he said.AdvertisementCritics pounced on the comments Tuesday accusing the White House and administration officials of deceiving the public about the law.Rep. Aaron Schock (R-Ill.) grilled Tavenner on the issue.“The whitehouse.gov website says if you want to keep the health insurance that you’ve got you can keep it and now they’re being told they can’t. That’s a lie” the Illinois Republican said.PHOTOS: President Obama’s pastAdvertisementThe White House noted that the vast majority of insured people who get insurance through their employer or through Medicare or Medicaid will not see any changes to their plans. Officials also argued that insurers have some leeway in how and when they alter the plans to meet the new standards. Many are offering new policies and also informing consumers that they may be eligible for subsidies through healthcare.gov.“They want to keep these people enrolled” said Robert Zirkelbach spokesman for America’s Health Insurance Plans an industry group.Still the issue is likely to continue particularly as the website troubles keep the White House from countering the criticism with signs of successful enrollment on a large scale.And Democratic allies acknowledged that the president could be more careful with his pitch.AdvertisementThe president’s statement about keeping insurance was “not precise enough” House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) told reporters Tuesday.“I don’t think the message was wrong. I think the message was accurate. It was not precise enough … [it] should have been caveated with ‘assuming you have a policy that in fact does do what the bill is designed to do.’”Sen. Joe Manchin a frequent Democratic critic of the law said the administration’s “don’t worry” mantra has worn thin: “Well people back in West Virginia are worried now.”kathleen.hennessey@latimes.comAdvertisementTwitter: @khennesseychristi.parsons@latimes.comTwitter: @cparsonsTimes staff writer Michael A.

406,On Tuesday Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) indicated on the floor of the Senate he was “open to having a vote” on Senator David Vitter’s (R-LA) amendment to eliminate the Obamacare exemption for members of Congress according to a Breitbart source on Capitol Hill. Today however he and his Democratic colleagues are singing a different tune and the lyrics come straight from that timeless phrase used by hypocrites throughout American history: “What’s good for thee is not good for me.”In early September Reid defended the exemption to Obamacare granted to members of Congress and their staffers by the Office of Personnel and Management on August 7. As Heritage’s The Foundry pointed out “there is no statutory authority either in Obamacare or in Title V of the U.S Code for the U.S. Office of Personnel Management to make government insurance contributions on behalf of federal employees to any plan other than an FEHBP plan.”But when Vitter introduced his No Washington Exemption from Obamacare Amendment on September 12 Reid was forced to make a decision on whether it should be brought to a vote. As Majority Leader of the Senate Reid exercises power by determining what bills will come to a vote in committees and before the full Senate.Reid has indicated from the outset that he opposes Vitter’s amendment but he has attempted to maintain the public fiction that the amendment would receive the same treatment as any amendment proposed by any member of the Senate.Despite significant evidence to the contrary Reid continues to insist that the Congressional exemption authorized by the Office of Personnel Management is contained within the law. But on Tuesday Vitter called the Congressional Obamacare exemption “flat out against the law” and that exposure of Reid’s blatant hypocrisy may have been too much for the Majority Leader to take.When Senate Democrats subsequently prevented Vitter’s amendment from coming to a vote Vitter took to the floor of the Senate and delivered a statement that called Reid out on his hypocrisy. “After freaking out last Thursday with threats and bribery this week Harry Reid said he’s fine with an up-or-down vote on my No Washington Exemption from Obamacare Amendment. I guess that was just a weak attempt at disguising his fear about losing his special exemption” he said.According to a statement issued by his office on Thursday “Vitter’s amendment would reverse and clarify the decision by the Office of Personnel and Management (OPM) on Obamacare. The legislation will require that all Members of Congress the President Vice President and all political appointees in the Administration must purchase their health insurance on the Obamacare Exchange without the help of taxpayer-funded subsidies. Congressional staff would be prohibited from receiving any contribution greater than what they would receive if they were not employed by a congressional office.”Tea party stalwart Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Mike Lee (R-UT) are co-sponsors of the Vitter amendment along with Senators Mike Enzi (R-WY) Dean Heller (R-V) Ron Johnson (R-WI) and Jim Inhofe (R-OK).,1
407,CNN has a very interesting new poll that not only debunks the notion that Americans have already decided Obamacare is a failure but also reveals that Americans overwhelmingly oppose the GOP's conservative critique of the health care law.According to the poll (pdf) which surveyed American adults between Nov. 18-20 with a margin of error of ±3.5 points:Most Americans believe Obamacare's current problems will be solved. 54 percent say they believe current problems will be fixed compared with 43 percent who say they won't be. Most Americans believe it's too early to judge whether Obamacare is a success or failure. A total of 53 percent think it is too early to say whether Obamacare is a success or failure. A total of 39 percent think it's a failure and 8 percent already think it is a success. Most Americans do not support conservative critiques of Obamacare. According to the poll 41 percent of Americans think Obamacare is too liberal slightly more than 40 percent who support Obamacare. But 14 percent think it's not liberal enough.As you might expect the poll's crosstabs show that most Republicans are certain Obamacare can't be fixed and has already failed but outside of the GOP universe people aren't merely open to Obamacare they are optimistic about its prospects and want it to work.Obviously it doesn't matter how open or optimistic the public is if the Obama administration can't ultimately deliver on the promise of Obamacare but if they do most Americans are on their side. Republicans have bet everything on failure. If they lose that bet it will be an absolute political nightmare for them—and it should be.,1
408,Last night Stephen Colbert laid into Fox News as only Stephen can do for trying to justify why women should pay more for health care in their attempts to attack Obamacare.When it comes to medical care men always get the short end of the long end of the scope. You see folks up until now health insurance in America has always struck a delicate balance. Women paid higher premiums than men and in return men paid less. (audience laughter) The system worked. But now folks all that's changing.STEVE DOOCY (8/27/2013): Obamacare will have men and women paying the same amount for health care but since women live longer and have babies shouldn't they pay more? DR. JANE HUGHES (9/24/2013): Under the new law they're including essential health benefits. And those essential health benefits include maternity pediatric dental and vision contraceptive services and free birth control pills — none of which a young man needs or wants.Did you catch that? Under Obamacare men will pay the same amount as women and yet we still don't get to pass a cantaloupe with toenails through our genitals. (audience laughter)Fox Business host and Madame Tussauds' wax figure of himself John Stossel reminds us why the ladies should pay more.JOHN STOSSEL (10/31/2013): You ought to be able to charge people who use the services more more! ... Women go to the doctor much more often than men. Maybe they're smarter or maybe they're hypochondriacs. They live longer who knows?Yeah ladies ladies come on. No ladies ladies love going to the doctor. Who knows why? Maybe they're pretending they're extras on Grey's Anatomy I don't know. They're suckers for that stuff.And Fox News chief urologist Dr. David Samadi gives us a real world example of the ladies' doctor addiction.8/27/2013: DR. DAVID SAMADI: That's not a really fair system. She sees her doctor all the time. When was the last time you went to see your doctor? BRIAN KILMEADE: Two years ago. DR. DAVID SAMADI: Exactly. And you? Last week. GRETCHEN CARLSON: I've had Lyme disease for the last 10 days so.... DR. DAVID SAMADI: That's what happens. So you're basically paying for her.It's not fair. And folks it's no wonder the brown-haired guy who's not Steve Doocy won't go to the doctor he hates wearing that cone.And folks he's not alone. The Fox doc explained the obvious reason why all men always go to the doctor less.DR. DAVID SAMADI (8/27/2013): We're using the health care system much less. You know also our bodies are completely different. ... We only have the prostate. Women have the breasts they have the ovaries they have the uterus. They get checked in every part.(wild audience laughter)You know you gotta squint. You gotta kind of squint to make out what's really going on down there. It's like one of those Magic Eye posters. They say there's a little man in a boat but I've never found it. (audience laughter)I tell you what fellas I tell you what. As long as we're footing the bill for all this lady maintenance I say we demand pap smears! (audience laughter) OK? Hey hey! It's guy-necologist not gal-necologist. (audience laughter) I say we make them find a place to stick that speculum. They're the doctors.,1
409,"Susan PageUSA TODAYPresident Obama's extraordinary mea culpa news conference Thursday was about more than making a fix in a provision of the Affordable Care Act.It was about turning around a downward slide that could threaten the future of his presidency.For more than three years congressional Republicans have flailed at the Affordable Care Act with limited success. Now in the space of six weeks the administration's own missteps — the botched roll-out of the federal exchange website and the broken promises over consumers being able to keep insurance plans they like — have significantly eroded confidence in Obama's signature legislative achievement and Democratic unity behind it.What's more with a string of apologies and some uncomfortable admissions Obama Thursday fueled questions about his administration's competence and his own leadership the most fundamental of presidential characteristics.""There have been times where I thought we got you know slapped around a little bit unjustly. This one's deserved all right? It's on us"" he said at one point. At another: ""I do make apologies for not having executed better over the last several months."" And one more: ""We fumbled the roll-out on this health care law.""He said he would delay for a year provisions in the health care law that required insurance companies to end policies that didn't have minimum coverage standards. But the insurance industry warned that step could raise premiums for everyone and state insurance commissioners questioned whether it was even feasible at this late date.And the revolt on Capitol Hill didn't seem to abate. House Republicans plan to vote Friday on a bill the White House opposes that would allow Americans to keep existing health care plans through 2014. Some Senate Democrats said they hoped to continue with plans for a similar measure.""What's happened in recent weeks is I think a dagger aimed at the heart of Obama's presidency"" says presidential scholar William Galston of the Brookings Institution a veteran of the Clinton White House. ""I say that not only because of the centrality of health care reform to the administration's agenda and to his legacy but also because it has posed a direct challenge to his standing as president in the eyes of the American people.""Obama's approval-disapproval rating was at 42%-52% in the daily Gallup Poll Thursday in the neighborhood of George W. Bush at this point in his second term and well below the standing of Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan. For the first time in his presidency a majority of Americans said Obama was not a strong and decisive leader.Approval of the Affordable Care Act also may be dropping fast. Just a few weeks ago 44% approved of the law 47% disapproved. Now just 40% approve and 55% disapprove the worst in at least a year.Surely only dire circumstances could have convinced the candidate once known as ""no-drama Obama"" to announce a policy change and then field questions for almost an hour in the White House press room. Not a person given to public introspection or apology his tone was contrite and even confessional at times.To be sure presidents have recovered from serious setbacks before. Reagan faced tough hearings over the Iran-contra scandal but finished his second term with a tax code overhaul and breakthrough agreements with the Soviet Union. Clinton survived impeachment. A booming economy and a falling jobless rate could do a lot to restore Obama's reputation.If things go as the White House hopes the HealthCare.gov website will be operating well by the end of this month. By the end of next March when the sign-up period is scheduled to end many of those consumers now concerned about losing their current plans will be persuaded that they're better off with a new one.At the moment however the Obamacare landscape is sufficiently rocky that when a reporter asked about about stalled negotiations over Iran's nuclear program it seemed to be almost a relief.Follow @susanpage on Twitter.",1
410,"Time to go on offense Mr. President.Time to go on offense Mr. President.The Affordable Care Act was designed to make sure all Americans had a certain level of insurance. But TPM has learned that USHealth Group is actively telling consumers that they don't need that minimum level. In fact company representatives are telling people they'd be better off without it. And the company may be just one player in a larger industry trend where companies see non-ACA compliant plans like the so-called fixed benefit coverage marketed by USHealth Group as a business opportunity. Health care industry analysts have long derided the kinds of non-insurance health care coverage products the company is selling as ""junk insurance."" ""They were not intended to be health insurance"" Sabrina Corlette a research professor at the Health Policy Institute at Georgetown University told TPM speaking about fixed benefit plans. ""They were intended to be what are called income replacement policies. ... But over the years these things have kind of morphed. And for many people unfortunately mainly because they come with a cheaper sticker price they are marketed as and treated as health insurance. Even though the coverage is really crappy."" USHealth Group's pitch is three-fold according to accounts provided to TPM by Mortimer and another prospective customer. First it says it is a misconception that everyone needs ACA-compliant insurance. Second USHealth Group plans are cheaper than ACA-compliant policies even after customers pay the tax penalty for failing to comply with the ACA's individual mandate. Third Obamacare is scary.Democrats should not be panicking over the relatively tiny number of people losing their junk health insurance plans. They should be loudly and continuously beating up on the insurance companies using Obamacare to trick people into buying new ones. Case in point: USHealth Group What USHealth Group isn't telling would-be customers what they are is that these fixed benefit coverage plans in which the company reimburses customers a fixed amount of money for medical services don't comply with the law. These plans aren't outlawed by Obamacare but they don't meet the requirements for coverage. That means that people buying them are just wasting their money because they will also have to get real coverage and if they don't they'll have to pay a penalty. They also won't have any coverage if they get sick. One of these kinds of plans Karen Pollitz a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation said is ""not health insurance in the sense it's going to protect you in any way from going broke.""Other only slightly less dastardly insurers are misleading their customers canceling policies that otherwise would have been grandfathered in order to get people into new ones that they can charge more for and not informing customers about their options on the exchanges. The president's administration fix would at least require insurers who do cancel plans to inform people of their options.It's not too late for Democrats including President Obama to go on offense against the insurance companies that are making the roll-out of Obamacare that much more difficult. Obama has met Republicans partway with his ""fix"" for policy cancellations. Now's the time to say enough and to start reminding people about what insurance companies do and why they made this law so necessary in the first place.",0
411,"A blunt critique from Bill Clinton on President Obama's handling of the rocky ObamaCare rollout is prompting the White House to pledge another set of health law fixes -- though in doing so it could inadvertently build the case for those calling for a delay in the law's implementation.Aside from scrambling to fix the broken HealthCare.gov website the administration is now trying to deal with the millions of Americans who have received cancellation notices. On Tuesday White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said the president's team is trying to figure out a way to offer relief to some of those policyholders.The statement comes after former President Clinton in an interview with the site Ozy.com said Obama should live up to his promise to Americans that if they like their health plans they can keep them.""So I personally believe even if it takes a change to the law the president should honor the commitment the federal government made to those people and let them keep what they got"" Clinton said.Asked Tuesday if Obama agreed Carney said: ""The answer's yes.""More On This...Carney referred to Obama's comments to NBC News last week when the president apologized for the cancellation notices and said the administration was looking at a ""range of options"" to address the issue.But Carney spoke in additional detail on Tuesday saying the president's team is specifically trying to help those Americans who have been forced off their plans into more expensive coverage which they might struggle to afford.""The president has tasked his team with looking at a range of options as he said to make sure that nobody is put in a position where their plans have been canceled and they can't afford a better plan even though they'd like to have a better plan"" Carney said.It's unclear though how the administration could go about doing that. Insurance companies are the ones canceling policies -- due to new requirements under the health care overhaul -- and would likely have to be involved in any effort to restore coverage.Robert Zirkelbach spokesman with America's Health Insurance Plans told FoxNews.com that all the myriad plans to reverse or stop the cancellation notices raise questions about how that would be achieved. He said in many cases changes to existing policies have already been filed with state regulators and consumers have been notified.""That's a lot to go back and unwind"" he said noting that any modified health plans would have to be reviewed and approved by state regulators.""That typical process takes many months"" he said.The insurance industry generally does not support any delay in the implementation of the ObamaCare insurance mandates out of concern that a delay would deprive them of much-needed customers at a time when they're dealing with the cost of additional coverage requirements.But any effort to overhaul the cancellations might require an extended timeframe.Separately House Republicans as well as some Senate Democrats are planning legislation that would allow people losing their current coverage to keep their plans.A Senate bill introduced by Louisiana Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu that would ensure Americans could keep their current health insurance plans was co-sponsored Tuesday by longtime Sen. Dianne Feinstein D-Calif.In his interview Tuesday Clinton defended the health care law as a whole but explained how the broken promise on health coverage can hurt young people. He relayed the story of a young man who said his individual market plan was canceled and replaced with one whose premiums were twice as high. Though his deductibles and co-pays were lower that savings is only realized if he gets sick Clinton explained.Obama in explaining the cancellation notices has clarified that under ObamaCare policies could be canceled if they had been altered in any way since the passage of the law.That nuance was not included in the president's initial explanations.The administration argues that while some are losing their current coverage those plans will be replaced by better-quality insurance. The flip side is that they could be more expensive.",1
412,The Obama administration decided that Obamacare Navigators tasked with helping Americans enroll in a health insurance plan would not undergo mandatory background checks. Now in the ten weeks since the launch of Healthcare.gov the ill-trained Navigators have put Americans’ sensitive health and tax information at risk.Breitbart News has obtained a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee report on the Obamacare Navigators that will be released Monday. It has found that Obamacare Navigators have been giving Americans misinformation and in some cases actively encouraging enrollees to commit fraud in order to raise their subsidies. To complicate matters further there is no way for Americans to find out whether their Navigators are properly certified.Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said at a Congressional hearing that it was “possible” for convicted felons to become Navigators. The report titled Risks of Fraud and Misinformation with ObamaCare Outreach Campaign: How Navigator and Assister Program Mismanagement Endangers Consumers concludes that is only one of many worries Americans should have about Navigators.The Oversight Committee chaired by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) and HHS actually learned that “poorly-trained Navigators gave consumers incorrect information about the health care exchanges violated HHS rules and procedures and even encouraged applicants to commit tax fraud in some instances.” Moreover this was learned from various news reports due to the complete lack of any internal oversight.On November 21 the Obama administration briefed the Committee. Those in attendance included Gary Cohen the Deputy Administrator and Director of the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO) and Mandy Cohen Director of the Consumer Support Group at CCIIO.The Committee report concluded that “documents call into question the effectiveness of the Navigator program and the Obama administration’s ability to safeguard consumer information.” HHS’s mismanagement of the Navigator and Assister programs “induces fraudulent behavior and poses real threats to the safety of consumers’ personally identifiable information such as one’s social security number yearly income and other sensitive tax information” the report found.The report also discovered that Obamacare Navigators have “encouraged consumers to commit tax fraud by underreporting income in order to qualify for ObamaCare’s health insurance subsidies.” Some have “assisted applicants before completing their 5 to 20 hour online training course and others took custody of paper applications and mailed them for the applicant violating the rule that applicants must mail in the application themselves.”For instance the Committee found:Navigators from the Urban League of Dallas were captured on video encouraging applicants to lie on their health insurance application so the applicants could qualify for tax subsidies. Navigators were also recorded advising an applicant to lie about her smoking habits to obtain a lower monthly premium. It was later discovered that two of the so-called Navigators involved in the incident were assisting consumers with their applications even though they had not completed their training and certification requirements.One self-identified Navigator gave a television interview in which she told viewers blatantly incorrect information–that applicants’ credit scores could impact their eligibility for certain plans. It later came to light that the woman was not a certified Navigator but rather a volunteer with a Navigator organization.Mountain Project Inc. a Navigator organization in North Carolina has been collecting and mailing paper applications on behalf of applicants in violation of Navigator rules and procedures.The report found that HHS officials responsible for the Navigator program did not learn of the aforementioned incidents from internal oversight procedures but rather from news reports.Yet the Obama administration still does not plan to implement a “secret shopper” program to monitor Navigators. HHS officials have put together “webinars” for Navigators but they are voluntary and do not cover specific details.The report also found that because the Obama administration did not warn Navigators that there could be problems with the HealthCare.Gov website “Navigators were essentially useless” when the website crashed and had problems. To make matters worse notes from an October 11 2013 meeting state that the Navigators were encouraging potential enrollees to use paper applications they knew may not bring applicants quicker results “to protect their reputations as people in the communities who can help.”The Committee found that this “push towards the use of paper applications further increases security risks since health insurance exchange applications contain personally identifiable information such as the applicant’s full name social security number the names and social security numbers of everyone in the applicant’s household and income for every member of the household.”The report also concluded that Navigators were also unprepared to handle situations in which consumers mentioned unreported income because the Obama administration did not even anticipate such situations. Gary Cohen the director of the agency overseeing the Navigators previously stated “this could be one of the areas where it is a little beyond the ability of your average Navigator” when asked whether Navigators knew how to deal with Americans who may be engaging in tax fraud or intending to under-report income.Though Cohen “admitted there is a need for better training on the issue through the ongoing education process” and did not rule out “requiring Navigators to report tax fraud in the future” the Obama administration “has not taken the necessary steps to prevent this type of tax fraud.” The report found that Navigators have not even been provided with a document on how to handle potential tax fraud issues that may arise.Navigators the report also found “lack guidance about how to comply with the Voting Rights Act which requires that federal government applications provide the opportunity for applicants to indicate their interest in registering to vote.”And though Cohen told the Committee staff that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services “[keep] a list of certified Navigators which as of mid-November numbered 2500 individuals” the list is private which means Americans do not have a way to know if their Navigators are actually even certified. That also allows Navigator organizations to “misrepresent the qualifications of an individual who is associated with that organization but is not a certified Navigator” the committee found.Navigator Report Update Final 12-13-13,1
413,Half of the people who have signed up for Obamacare in 17 states have not activated their health insurance plans by making their first premium payment a trend that threatens to further embarrass and frustrate President Barack Obama and the highly unpopular Obamacare program.Health insurance plans purchased through Obamacare only kick in once a customer pays their first month’s premium. On Monday the Wall Street Journal reported that “only about half of enrollees billed for plans offered by more than 100 insurers in 17 states had paid their first month’s premium” according to Benaissance chief strategy officer Mark Waterstraat whose firm serves as a third-party billing company for insurers. Another insurer Scott & White Health Plan told the Journal that only 35% of its enrollees have paid for the plans they applied for.The Obama administration remains far behind its 7 million enrollment target but has recently celebrated what it calls two million Obamacare “enrollments.” Yet that figure merely reflects the number of applications submitted not the number of paying customers who have turned on their plans by actually paying for coverage. Whether insurers in the other 33 states are experiencing nonpayment rates in the 35% to 50% range is presently unknown. If those rates extended nationally they would mean the Obama administration’s claim that it has enrolled two million people in Obamacare would plunge to just 700000 to one million.Even progressive groups like the left-leaning journalism group ProPublica say the emergence of an Obamacare nonpayment gap raises “the prospect that actual enrollment will be far lower than the figures HHS [Health and Human Services] is releasing.”Part of the problem may be the costs of the plans offered through Obamacare. A recent USA Today analysis found that over half of all counties in the 34 states on the federal HealthCare.gov exchange “lack even a bronze plan that’s affordable by the government’s own definition.”“There is also a lot of worrying going on over people making payments” industry consultant Robert Laszewski told ProPublica.Experts say that first-time insurance buyers may not fully understand the duties and responsibilities that come with ownership. A recent study published in the Journal of Health Economics found that only 14% of individuals who have health coverage could correctly answer all four of four basic questions about health insurance including understanding what a “deductible” and “copay” mean. If comprehension levels are that low for those who already have insurance analysts worry what that might mean for first-time insurance purchasers especially for a program as complex as Obamacare.Persistence of the Obamacare nonpayment trend would pose serious challenges for the Obama administration’s ability to hit its goal of seven million paying customers by the end of March.According to the latest CNN poll support for Obamacare is now at a record low 35%.Obamacare will cost U.S. taxpayers $2.6 trillion over the next ten years.,1
414,"Story highlights Insurance company executives say they got calls from White House after speaking out A trade group leader says the Obama administration ""is exerting massive pressure"" A White House spokesman calls the accusation ""preposterous and inaccurate""(CNN) —White House officials have pressured insurance industry executives to keep quiet amid mounting criticism over Obamacare’s rollout insurance industry sources told CNN.Sebelius: ‘I apologize I’m accountable’ for Obamacare website flawsAfter insurance officials publicly criticized the implementation White House staffers contacted insurers to express their displeasure industry insiders said.Multiple sources declined to speak publicly about the push back because they fear retribution.But Bob Laszewski who heads a consulting firm for big insurance companies did talk on the record.“The White House is exerting massive pressure on the industry including the trade associations to keep quiet” he said.Laszewski who’s been a vocal critic of Obamacare said he’s been asked by insurance executives to speak out because they feel defenseless against an administration that is regulating their business – and a big customer.Government-backed plans accounted for about half of health care policies last year a number that is expected to grow over the years.White House spokesman Jay Carney said the idea that administration officials are trying to silence insurance industry insiders is “preposterous and inaccurate.” He added that Laszewski has been a vocal critic of health care reform for two decades.“Plus it ignores the fact that every day insurance companies are out talking about the law – in large part because they are trying to reach millions of new customers who will now have new affordable insurance options available from providers through the new Market Places” Carney said.Obama and his top advisers have acknowledged problems with the health care website.On Wednesday Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was the latest administration official to apologize for the bungled rollout.Yet she and other officials continue to argue that once they are fully up and running the insurance exchanges will benefit Americans.But Obama also has been accused of breaking his promise that people who like their current plans can keep them. Insurers have begun discontinuing policies that don’t meet Obamacare’s beefed up coverage requirements.Laszewski said insurance company officials are embarrassed that they have to cancel plans and force people into more robust and possibly more expensive coverage.Keep your plan? Maybe notInsurers he said warned the White House that the regulations would lead to discontinued policies.“One of the things I think is clear here is the Obama administration has no trust in anything the health insurance industry is telling them about how to run a health plan” Laszewski said.5 things we learned from Tuesday’s Obamacare hearing",1
415,"By Roberta Rampton WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee issued a subpoena on Friday to compel Todd Park the chief technology officer at the White House to testify at a hearing next week about what went wrong with the Obamacare website. The White House called the subpoena ""unfortunate and unnecessary"" and said that Park was busy fixing the website. The White House earlier had said he was willing to appear voluntarily in December. ""We had hoped the committee would work with us to find an alternative date to give Todd time to focus on the immediate task at hand: getting the website fixed"" said Rick Weiss a spokesman for the White House Office of Science and Technology. ""We are reviewing the subpoena and will respond as appropriate"" Weiss said. Darrell Issa the California Republican who chairs the committee told Park that he was the only administration witness at the November 13 hearing who was ""unwilling to appear voluntarily"" and noted that he had taken time out to give an interview to the New York Times in early October. ""Millions of Americans have lost their health insurance"" Issa wrote in a letter to Park. ""They deserve your sworn testimony before their elected representatives about what went wrong - not simply the media outlets that White House officials have deemed an appropriate use of your time"" he said. PARK: 'NOT GOING ANYWHERE' The HealthCare.gov website which launched October 1 was meant to be an easy way for Americans to shop for health insurance and see whether they were eligible for subsidies under President Barack Obama's signature healthcare program. But it has been plagued by myriad technical woes and contractors and outside experts have been working around the clock to try to make it work by the end of November so that Americans have enough time to sign up for insurance before deadlines in the law. On Friday Jeffrey Zients the White House official charged to oversee the fixes said the website is improving but is still ""a long way from where it needs to be. A successful healthcare IT developer before joining the Obama administration Park has been part of the scramble to repair the website. Earlier on Friday the White House had scolded Issa for failing to justify why the hearing with Park could not be slated for December. ""There will be ample time to analyze why the technology behind the website did not perform well initially and whether there are any lessons learned for federal IT acquisition policy that Congress may want to address"" said Donna Pignatelli assistant director for legislative affairs for the Office of Science and Technology Policy in a letter to Issa. ""Mr. Park is not going anywhere"" Pigantelli had said. (Additional reporting By Karey Van Hall; Editing by Ken Wills)",1
416,After months of technical glitches and political tumult a burst of last-minute insurance shoppers illustrated the growing appetite for Obamacare and the enormous challenges ahead in making the massive healthcare expansion work.On Monday the crush of consumers prompted the Obama administration to put thousands of applicants on hold and push back another key enrollment deadline to Tuesday. This unexpected move came despite weeks of computer fixes aimed at improving the troubled HealthCare.gov website.Even in California and other states where enrollment was running more smoothly plenty of consumers were experiencing snags.Anibal Manzano 56 left a clinic in downtown Los Angeles on Monday without signing up because enrollment counselors were stymied by computer delays with the California enrollment system.AdvertisementThe pet groomer said he has never had insurance and wanted to get coverage for himself and his wife. “I’ll come back next week and see if that works out” he said.California officials said some technical headaches were inevitable but the state website was working well enough to have enabled more than 400000 people to enroll in private health plans as of Sunday. Nearly 30000 people were picking out coverage daily not counting thousands more Medi-Cal enrollees.“The Affordable Care Act is taking off in California and that bodes well for the nation” said Peter Lee executive director of the Covered California exchange. “It’s exciting to see a state coming together and say: ‘Let’s make the Affordable Care Act work. Let’s put politics aside.’”Even with the late surge national enrollment in private health plans remains well short of the administration’s goal of roughly 3 million by year end. Federal officials didn’t release new figures Monday.AdvertisementPresident Obama said last week that more than half a million Americans had enrolled so far in December using the federal website. That would bring the total enrollment in health plans to more than 1 million as of Friday including both federal and state-run exchanges. Nationwide an additional 800000 people had been deemed eligible for the law’s expanded version of Medicaid through November.Strong enrollment is crucial particularly among young and healthier policyholders to keep insurance premiums affordable in the government-run marketplaces and to fulfill Obama’s goal of dramatically reducing the number of uninsured nationwide.“It has been a terrible three months for getting this underway. It’s been a real tragedy” said Timothy Jost a health policy expert and law professor at Washington and Lee University in Lexington Va. “But I think we are turning the corner and things will go a lot more smoothly for the next three months.”Across the country over the weekend hundreds of thousands of consumers went online or visited enrollment events to meet a Monday deadline for coverage starting Jan. 1.AdvertisementApplications will be taken through March 31 when the six-month enrollment window closes. Coverage generally takes effect within a few weeks of signing up.As the deadline approached federal officials said the HealthCare.gov site used by residents of 36 states received 1.2 million visits over the weekend and more than 1 million by late afternoon Monday.By midday Monday the federal officials activated a queuing system designed to relieve pressure on the site. Julie Bataille an administration spokeswoman said that more than 60000 visitors had submitted their e-mail addresses to be notified when the site was less busy.Federal officials and their contractors spent weeks retooling HealthCare.gov after a disastrous launch in October.AdvertisementIn light of the bottlenecks administration officials extended by 24 hours the deadline to sign up for coverage that will become effective Jan. 1. The White House described the postponement as merely a stop-gap to make sure that no one who is online by midnight Monday would be excluded.“Anticipating high demand which we indeed saw starting early [Monday] morning and the fact that consumers may be enrolling from multiple time zones we have taken steps to make sure that those who tried to enroll today but had delays due to high traffic have a fail-safe” Bataille said.Critics of the healthcare law however say the latest deadline shift represents another failure by the Obama administration. And many insurers and consumer advocates have bristled at the ever-changing rules that they said sow even more confusion among the public about a complex healthcare overhaul.“How can anyone make healthcare decisions today knowing that the law may be unilaterally changed again tomorrow?” House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) said last week.AdvertisementSeveral state-run exchanges such as those in California New York and Kentucky have been reporting robust enrollment while states that rely on the federal site have lagged far behind.But enrollment counselors in California said the state website was slow or unresponsive Monday often making an application take up to two hours to finish. Wait times to state call centers stretched beyond an hour in some cases according to Covered California.Gil Alcala a state-certified insurance agent in Covina said he worried about 25 applicants possibly falling through the cracks because the Covered California website wouldn’t let him input data from their paper applications Monday.“The website is freezing and then I get an error notification” Alcala said. “They need to push this deadline back again. This is terrible.”AdvertisementCalifornia officials said they were sticking with the Dec. 23 deadline but they vowed to help anyone who starts an application Monday to get coverage starting Jan. 1.“We will help people get across the finish line who have started an application [Monday]” Lee said. “If you have made a good-faith effort to get started you can finish it [Tuesday].”Los Angeles resident Jeff Norman 54 tried to beat the deadline and applied last week for Medicaid coverage. But he said he still hadn’t received confirmation of insurance starting Jan. 1. His current coverage through Anthem Blue Cross is being canceled Dec. 31 because it didn’t meet all the requirements of the healthcare law.Norman needs regular physical therapy on his aching hip and leg he said. “If I want to get medical services at the beginning of January” he said “I don’t know what will happen.”Advertisementchad.terhune@latimes.comdavid.lauter@latimes.commaeve.reston@latimes.comTwitter: @chadterhune @davidlauter @maeverestonAdvertisementTimes staff writer James Barragan contributed to this story from Los Angeles,1
417,"Dean Obeidallah says a lack of explanation of Obamacare has left room for critics to distort it as in the ""ObamaCareNado"" ad.Story highlights Dean Obeidallah says the administration has done a poor job of explaining Obamacare He says the plan has many popular features but the public doesn't fully understand it A failure to explain has left room for Republicans to distort it he says Obeidallah: Administration has belatedly moved to tout the benefits of ObamacareEditor’s Note: Dean Obeidallah a former attorney is a political comedian and frequent commentator on various TV networks including CNN. He is the editor of the politics blog The Dean’s Report. Follow him on Twitter @deanofcomedy.(CNN) —Can someone please explain to me the details of Obamacare? And when I say “someone” I’m looking at you President Obama – or at least members of your administration.I can’t fathom how Obama one of the best orators of modern-day politics could be such a poor advocate for what’s arguably the crowning legislative achievement of his administration. I can assure you that if there were a law named after me – such as “Obeidallahcare” or “Deanaid” – I would be crisscrossing the country explaining it so people would understand and support it.Sure most of us get the broad strokes of the Affordable Care Act commonly known as Obamacare: the individual mandate coverage for the uninsured children on parents’ policy until 26 carriers cannot deny you coverage or charge you more due to a pre-existing condition. But the law is close to 1000 pages and will spur hundreds if not thousands of regulations. What else does the law offer and how will Americans be able to gain access to its benefits?Will Obamacare help primary care?Dean ObeidallahWe hear about state health insurance exchanges going into effect in October but in the same breath we hear that many governors won’t implement them. We hear about the individual mandate obligating everyone to buy health insurance by 2014 or face a penalty but then we hear the Obama administration has delayed the requirement that employers with more than 50 employees be required to provide health coverage until 2015.It’s remarkable that there’s such confusion surrounding a piece of legislation signed into law more than three years ago – in March 2010. And I’m far from alone on this. A poll in April found that 40% of Americans didn’t even know if Obamacare is still in effect which translates into roughly 130 million Americans not even knowing if the law still exists let alone understanding the details of it.Even more concerning is that a recent poll of doctors found by a wide margin that they are “not at all familiar” with how certain key provisions of the law will be implemented. And astoundingly it appears that Democratic members of Congress don’t even fully grasp how Obamacare will be put into effect. That point was made crystal clear when Democratic Sen. Max Baucus one of the early champions of the law recently labeled the rollout of Obamacare “a huge train wreck coming down.” In response Obama’s chief of staff has been spending time over the past three months giving presentations to Democrats in Congress so they can better understand the law.Who loses out under Obamacare?What’s even more surprising is that Obama has allowed the void of information from his end to be filled almost unchallenged by Republicans who have been actively working to define the law in the worst possible terms. Unless Obama is mimicking the rope-a-dope fighting strategy made famous by Muhammad Ali his administration’s outreach to the public on Obamacare has been an abysmal failure.The consequence of Obama ceding the battlefield can be seen in a new poll that found 54% of Americans disapprove of the law and a record-high 39% want Congress to repeal it. The poll also found just 13% of Americans say the health care law will personally “help me” but 38% believe the law will personally “hurt me.”Maybe it was these poll numbers or perhaps being pushed by members of his own party but it seems that Obama is finally aware of the public relations nightmare and possible policy failure staring him in the face. The administration has recently started organizing faith-based and community groups to help get out the word. The federal government just launched a multimillion-dollar campaign to educate people about coverage options under Obamacare.It has even secured the support of the people at the Funny or Die comedy website to produce videos with well-known comedic actors explaining Obamacare – because nothing says “comedy gold” like a law about health insurance.Obama meets with celebs who want to promote ObamacareBut why didn’t Obama utilize his great communication skills to explain this law to us sooner? Why hasn’t he traveled across the country waging something akin to his election campaign to sell his program?And it’s not like Obama doesn’t see the value in taking his ideas directly to the American public to build support. Indeed we saw Obama use this very tactic last week as he kicked off the first of a series of speeches regarding his proposals to strengthen and grow the economy. The president did mention Obamacare in that speech pointing out that “the states that have committed themselves to making this law work are finding that competition and choice are actually pushing costs down. Just last week New York announced that premiums for consumers who buy their insurance in these online marketplaces will be at least 50% less than what they pay today.”And what’s even more bizarre is that polls show strong support for many key provisions of Obamacare. The president could have (and should have) been touting these popular parts of the law for years given that 61% of Americans favor allowing children to stay on the policy until they are 26 and 82% like the ban on insurance carriers from denying coverage for those with pre-existing conditions.Could it be that Obama isn’t waging such a campaign because even he can’t explain this mammoth program in a way that will attract support? Is it possible that the president’s idealistic dream of what Obamacare was intended to be has been replaced three years later by an administrative nightmare?The real reason why the Obama administration has remained largely invisible as Republicans have pummeled Obamacare may never truly be known. But it’s clear that Obamacare needs a massive infusion of PR care if it is going to succeed.Watch: Two sides of ObamacareFollow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.",1
418,WASHINGTON — Barack Obama won the presidency by exploiting a political environment that devoured George W. Bush in a second term plagued by sinking credibility failed legislative battles fractured world relations and revolts inside his own party.President Obama is now threatened by a similar toxic mix. The disastrous rollout of his health care law not only threatens the rest of his agenda but also raises questions about his competence in the same way that the Bush administration’s botched response to Hurricane Katrina undermined any semblance of Republican efficiency.But unlike Mr. Bush who faced confrontational but occasionally cooperative Democrats Mr. Obama is battling a Republican opposition that has refused to open the door to any legislative fixes to the health care law and has blocked him at virtually every turn. A contrite-sounding Mr. Obama repeatedly blamed himself on Thursday for the failed health care rollout which he acknowledged had thrust difficult burdens on his political allies and hurt Americans’ trust in him.“It’s legitimate for them to expect me to have to win back some credibility on this health care law in particular and on a whole range of these issues in general” Mr. Obama said. The president did not admit to misleading people about whether they could keep their insurance but again expressed regret that his assurances turned out to be wrong.,1
419,In the heady days after the October 1 launch of the Affordable Care Act -- better known as ObamaCare -- Lady Gaga Amy Poehler Nina Dobrev Rosario Dawson Sarah Silverman Olivia Wilde Alicia Keys Jennifer Hudson Pearl Jam Lance Bass John Legend Alyssa Milano and Kerry Washington joined the President to encourage Americans to #getcovered.Since then technical glitches and website snafus have so marred the ObamaCare website that the team who built it has been called to testify before Congress on Thursday. But there will be no celebrities flanking them on Capitol Hill as the stars that helped launch the initiative are now being advised to walk away.One well-placed Hollywood agent told FOX411 that while Obama and ObamaCare are separate issues and that you can support one without the other public relations teams across the industry are cautioning their clients to now lay off the latter. Even Oprah Winfrey one of the President’s most influential mouthpieces during his first election reportedly refused to get on-board and lend a hand.“Hollywood has gone from pushing #getcovered to heading for cover” Dan Gainor VP of Business and Culture at the Media Research Center told FOX411. “Stars like Lady Gaga and Sarah Silverman pushed their ObamaCare propaganda to more than 67 million fans on social media. But don’t expect them to be honest about the situation.”Georgia attorney Patrick Millsaps who served as chief of staff of Newt Gingrich’s 2012 presidential campaign and manages several Hollywood names said celebrities like most public figures know where to draw the line.“They are starting to realize they too were sold a bill of goods and aren’t going to be accomplices in a continued fraud” he said. “This is an easy decision for a manager – you can’t let your client promote a crappy product.”“Many of my Hollywood friends still believe in this guy” Millsaps added. “But I think their faith is being tested.”Publicist Ronn Torossian of 5WPR agreed. “When things go wrong naturally celebrities won’t want to be outspoken. But don’t expect them to be quiet for long” he said. “They will stand up again as soon as President Obama asks them to.”Enter Scarlett Johansson. One of President Obama’s best celebrity friends (she revealed during his campaign that the two were text buddies) Johansson has lent her voice to a Planned Parenthood message that’s played when calls are placed to some of their health centers. “Did you know you may be able to enroll in new more affordable health insurance plans?” Johansson asks before directing callers to a Planned Parenthood section on the new Affordable Care Act website.Whether callers can get through to that web address is obviously another issue.,1
420,"Not the same thing.Not the same thing.The disastrous rollout of [President Obama's] health care law not only threatens the rest of his agenda but also raises questions about his competence in the same way that the Bush administration’s botched response to Hurricane Katrina undermined any semblance of Republican efficiency.Obamacare's rollout does not involve an American city underwater. There are no bodies in the streets. Rather a website is not working well and a set of mostly crappy insurance plans are being canceled with insurance companies taking the Affordable Care Act as their excuse for canceling some decent policies after years of canceling decent policies without that excuse. The Affordable Care Act is an attempt to fix a big problem—tens of millions of Americans without health insurance and many more paying more than they can afford or finding out that what they've been paying for won't cover them if they really need it. Parts of its rollout have been botched but with six weeks left before the insurance plans go into effect and with months before the end of the open enrollment period 106000 people have signed up for insurance and 396000 people have become eligible for Medicaid. So what we're looking at is a law designed to help people not helping them as much as hoped not a failure to respond with urgency competence or compassion to a massive natural disaster.The' Michael Shear demonstrating how if Republicans repeat a talking point enough times they can get reporters to write it up as if it's a fact not a Republican talking point:Whereas if the rollout had gone smoothly House Republicans would be passing comprehensive immigration reform right this minute. But about that Katrina comparison. Let's review two key differences:Of course Republicans want to compare Obamacare to Katrina. After first denying that Katrina was a political disaster for them they switched gears to trying to use it for political advantage against Democrats and have been looking for something they can stick with the name ""Obama's Katrina"" for years. Previous ""Obama's Katrina"" attempts have included the Haiti earthquake Benghazi and the IRS Hurricane Sandy the BP oil spill and at least half a dozen other things. It's a knee-jerk reaction by now—for Republicans. New York Times reporters shouldn't participate in it. It's not like there aren't ways to say ""the Obama administration screwed up"" without invoking a generation-shaping disaster after all.",1
421,President Barack Obama has illegally suspended the single most important provision of Obamacare the infamous Individual Mandate for some Americans.On Dec. 19 the president declared a change to the Individual Mandate a provision that led to the first lawsuit in American history where a majority of the states in this nation (26 out of 50) sued the federal government over the constitutionality of a federal law resulting in a historic Supreme Court decision that conservative lawyers and scholars roundly condemn insofar as it upheld the Individual Mandate as a massive tax by a 5-4 vote.The Obama administration’s disastrous rollout of Obamacare has been a textbook illustration of the manifest incompetence of government to run the American healthcare system from the humiliating website difficulties to the eye-popping costs of skyrocketing monthly insurance premiums and deductibles. The White House explains that it would be unfair under these circumstances to penalize Americans who attempt to obtain insurance through the Obamacare exchanges but are unable to do so.Therefore the president has declared a “hardship exemption” for Americans encountering those difficulties. There will be a grace period for at least part of 2014. The White House has not specified a firm date of when this exemption will definitely end or how they will be able to distinguish with certainty people who earnestly tried to obtain insurance versus those who are gaming the system.But this exemption like those that came before it is illegal. The language of ACA’s Section 1501 is to impose a truly-mandatory Individual Mandate. Conservatives insist that even if all the provisions in the ACA are applied the system will not work financially. But even liberals admit that if the Individual Mandate is not in force then you do not bring in enough revenue from young healthy adults to pay for the staggering cost of the massive new entitlements and programs that the ACA creates. Without the Individual Mandate you get a “death spiral” of growing deficits that will render health insurance companies insolvent and deprive healthcare providers of payment for their life-saving treatments.In Section 1513 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) the Employer Mandate (the requirement for companies employing 50+ people) specifies that this requirement for employers to offer insurance goes into effect Jan. 1 2014. When Obama announced over the summer that he was suspending that requirement until 2015 he said he has the power to “tweak” a law so long as that tweaking “doesn’t go to the essence of the law.”That’s dead wrong under the U.S. Constitution. Ironically it would not apply here anyway since some of these provisions like the Individual Mandate and the Employer Mandate are two of the most important provisions of the entire ACA and are essential to the ACA’s core operations. However even if they were insignificant provisions the Constitution does not permit a president to change a single semicolon of a federal law by himself.Under Article I of the Constitution every law must either pass the House the Senate and be signed by the president or if the president vetoes the bill instead of signing it then it must pass the House and Senate a second time by a two-thirds super-majority vote in each chamber. That is the only process by which federal law can be made. Everything else is illegal.Many laws authorize top administrative officials to develop regulations carrying the force of law to implement some provision in the law. Other laws contain provisions that empower executive-branch officials to suspend or modify certain legal requirements usually for a fixed period of time and only after certain conditions are met such as completing a study that discovers facts that are relevant to the law’s operations. This power is delegated by the terms of the statute where the federal law-making body–Congress–votes to include such an option in a law.That is not the case with these parts of Obamacare. The changes in the law that President Obama has announced such as telling insurers in Nov. 2013 that they could continue offering canceled policies have been unilateral changes to mandatory terms in the federal law passed by Congress. These are provisions where Congress did not allow Obama or any of his Cabinet secretaries any discretion or options. They are requirements that bind the government and the private sector.So not only is Obamacare bad policy but now another aspect of this program is illegal.Ken Klukowski is senior legal analyst for Breitbart News and represented Members of Congress at the Supreme Court in Obamacare litigation.

422,On Thursday President Barack Obama said of his health care law: “Despite all the evidence that the law is working the way it’s supposed to” there are critics out there. He says they must be doing it for purely political reasons. That sound you hear is the fire alarm going off in the White House.Shortly after the Affordable Care Act (ACA or Obamacare) was signed into law on Mar. 23 2010 the administration announced that the massive Title VIII of the law–the CLASS Act that would set up a national system of elderly case–would never be implemented because the Obama administration cannot find any way either to implement the system or to pay for it.Over the past three years the Obama administration has been issuing “waivers” for various ACA requirements regarding how much companies must pay out in health care benefits to employees because many low-wage employers like McDonald’s couldn’t meet those requirements and would have to cancel all health care benefits for those employees. (It should also be noted that the “waivers” are unlawful because the ACA imposes that requirement on employers and does not allow the government to waive them.)A year ago the Supreme Court struck down as a violation of the Tenth Amendment the mandatory expansion of Medicaid in all 50 states making it entirely optional. The White House started scrambling when half the states in the nation refused to go along with this unaffordable and unmanageable expansion of government health care.Also a year ago the IRS issued a new regulation saying that the massive subsidies that taxpayers would have to pay on health care policies purchased from state-run government exchanges in all 50 states would also apply to policies purchased on an exchange run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services because it became clear that many states would not participate in that government-run model either. (In fact 34 states have refused to set up exchanges and the IRS’s regulation is being challenged in court as illegal.)Then two weeks ago the Treasury Department announced that for the first year it is in effect (2014) the IRS would not enforce the Employer Mandate requiring large employers to provide healthcare to employees. The system was ready to implode and deprive millions of Americans of both health care and work hours (forcing many employers to cut hours to 29/week for full-time employees) and the IRS could not develop an effective reporting or enforcement system. (Like the “waivers” above this too is illegal.)And just this week HHS announced that the massive state exchange system may be put off a year as well. It was supposed to start on Oct. 1 2013 and is having so many severe problems that it too cannot start when the ACA says it must.Yet with all that Obama says that the ACA is working great and those who deny it must have sinister political motives. (Set aside the fact that now some of the ACA’s biggest critics are major unions like AFL-CIO and the Teamsters normally Obama’s biggest allies and without whose zealous support the ACA would never have passed Congress.)It’s like George Orwell’s 1984. The government literally could say 2+2=5 and no one would call them on it. If a conservative leader said such things the media would call for his head. But when a liberal does it they ignore it. (Or if you’re MSNBC you applaud his “courage” and might offer him a TV show to anchor.)If any private citizen said such things we’d have a one-word label for him: “liar.” But most people in this country rightly show great respect for the institution of the presidency that we don’t use such terms (unless they’re committed liberals and the president happens to be a conservative Republican–in which case you can call him anything you want). Instead we say he’s “got his facts wrong” or he’s using “fuzzy math” or some other such softer statement.So using such a word would be disrespectful and we won’t do it here. But if the smoke detectors go off at the White House there’s no need to call the fire department. The smoke is because President Obama’s pants are on fire.Breitbart News legal columnist Ken Klukowski is senior fellow for religious liberty at the Family Research Council and on faculty at Liberty University School of Law.,1
423,Deborah Cavallaro is a hard-working real estate agent in the Westchester suburb of Los Angeles who has been featured prominently on a round of news shows lately talking about how badly Obamacare is going to cost her when her existing plan gets canceled and she has to find a replacement.She says she’s angry at President Obama for having promised that people who like their health plans could keep them when hers is getting canceled for not meeting Obamacare’s standards.“Please explain to me” she told Maria Bartiromo on CNBC Wednesday “how my plan is a ‘substandard’ plan when ... I’d be paying more for the exchange plans than I am currently paying by a wide margin.”Bartiromo didn’t take her up on her request. So I will.AdvertisementSEE ALSO: Why men should pay for pregnancy coverageThe bottom line is that Cavallaro’s assertion that “there’s nothing affordable about the Affordable Care Act” as she put it Tuesday on NBC Channel 4 is the product of her own misunderstandings abetted by a passel of uninformed and incurious news reporters.I talked with Cavallaro 60 after her CNBC appearance. Let’s walk through what she told me.Her current plan from Anthem Blue Cross is a catastrophic coverage plan for which she pays $293 a month as an individual policyholder. It requires her to pay a deductible of $5000 a year and limits her out-of-pocket costs to $8500 a year. Her plan also limits her to two doctor visits a year for which she shoulders a copay of $40 each. After that she pays the whole cost of subsequent visits.AdvertisementThis fits the very definition of a nonconforming plan under Obamacare. The deductible and out-of-pocket maximums are too high the provisions for doctor visits too skimpy.As for a replacement plan she says she was quoted $478 a month by her insurance broker but that’s a lot more than she’ll really be paying. Cavallaro told me she hasn’t checked the website of Covered California the state’s health plan exchange herself. I did so while we talked.Here’s what I found. I won’t divulge her current income which is personal but this year it qualifies her for a hefty federal premium subsidy.At her age she’s eligible for a good “silver” plan for $333 a month after the subsidy -- $40 a month more than she’s paying now. But the plan is much better than her current plan -- the deductible is $2000 not $5000. The maximum out-of-pocket expense is $6350 not $8500. Her co-pays would be $45 for a primary care visit and $65 for a specialty visit -- but all visits would be covered not just two.AdvertisementIs that better than her current plan? Yes by a mile.If she wanted to pay less Cavallaro could opt for lesser coverage in a “bronze” plan. She could buy one from the California exchange for as little as $194 a month. From Anthem it’s $256 or $444 a year less than she’s paying now. That buys her a $5000 deductible (the same as she’s paying today) but the out-of-pocket limit is lower $6350. Office visits would be $60 for primary care and $70 for specialties but again with no limit on the number of visits. Factor in the premium savings and it’s hard to deny that she’s still ahead.Cavallaro told me a couple of things that are worth considering. First what she likes about her current plan is that she can go to any doctor of her choice and any hospital. That’s not entirely true because her current plan with Anthem does favor a network. Plainly however it’s broad enough to serve her purposes. She’s concerned that the new plans will offer smaller networks which is probably true though it’s not necessarily true that the new networks will exclude her favorite doctors hospitals or prescription formularies.She also mentioned that her annual income fluctuates. It can be substantially lower or substantially higher than it is this year. What if next year she earns too much to qualify for the subsidy? Also a fair point -- at her current income the subsidy is worth more than $200 a month to her. But that’s not the same as saying that “there’s nothing affordable about the Affordable Care Act” because at her current income the act is vastly more affordable to her than what she’s paying now.AdvertisementWhen she told Channel 4 that “for the first time in my whole life I will be without insurance” it’s hard to understand what she was talking about. (Channel 4 didn’t ask.) Better plans than she has now are available for her to purchase today some of them for less money.The sad truth is that Cavallaro has been very poorly served by the health insurance industry and the news media. It seems that Anthem didn’t adequately explain her options for 2014 when it disclosed that her current plan is being canceled. If her insurance brokers told her what she says they did they failed her. And the reporters who interviewed her without getting all the facts produced inexcusably shoddy work -- from Maria Bartiromo on down. They not only did her a disservice but failed the rest of us too.,0
424,The health law guarantees that up to 400 percent of poverty level shoppers on the marketplace won't have to spend more than a certain percent of their income on insurance premiums. The higher you get up the income scale the larger chunk of your income your expected to kick in.Someone who earns 100 percent of the poverty line (right now $11490 for an individual) is only expected to spend 2 percent of his or her income on health coverage or $19 for a monthly premium. If the insurance plan charges more than that - and there's a good chance it does - the federal government has to kick in the difference.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIn a state like Wyoming for example the cost of a medium level plan (or for the wonks the second-lowest cost silver-level plan) is $743 per month. Since the enrollee is only putting up $19 per month that leaves the federal government footing a bill of $724 per month or $8688 annually.It's not totally clear why certain pockets of the country - Southern Georgia for example or the whole state of Wyoming - ended up with significantly higher premium costs than the rest of the country. Graves thinks that some of it has to do with this being the first year of insurers bidding on the new marketplaces and having to do a bit of guesswork on what premiums ought to be.In Wyoming and Georgia where there are only two plans selling on the marketplace those guesses came back especially high.,1
425,A veteran Washington adviser who has worked for four Presidents on both sides of the political aisle said that the stunning Government Accountability Report that found President Barack Obama has not had a one-on-one meeting with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius since the passage of Obamacare over three years ago is an indictment of the entire White House operation and shows that the Obama administration has bordered on “malfeasance.”“I have no doubt the White House is right that Secretary Sebelius was in several group meetings with the president about health care” Gergen caveated “but the whole point is there was nobody in charge in the administration.”Appearing on CNN’s Newsroom program Saturday night was David Gergen a known Washington “fixer.” Some veteran Washington observers have even suggested that Obama should bring Gergen in to help manage the Obamacare rollout crisis. He was asked by CNN Anchor Deborah Feyerick about the GAI report.Feyerick cited a report from “an outfit called the Government Accountability Institute [that] finds the president and HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius held just a single one-on-one meeting after Obamacare was signed into law over three years ago.”“I don’t think this is simply sloppiness on the part of the White House” Gergen said. “What seems to me is there’s a case of near malfeasance here.”Gergen who has served as Director of Speechwriting for the Nixon White House Director of Communications for both Presidents Ford and Reagan and then as a senior advisor to President Bill Clinton is intimately familiar with how the White House operates. In addition he normally takes a “neutral” position on most matters and often gives those in power the benefit of doubt.But Gergen emphasized that the GAI report concerning the lack of meetings between Sebelius and Obama raises troubling issues about the conduct of affairs in the Obama White House.Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large and Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer unveiled the report on Wednesday on Fox News’s Hannity and Breitbart News.As Breitbart News has reported Schweizer said there was no evidence on the White House schedule that showed Obama cared about Obamacare.“In the case of President Obama if you look at his calendar there is no evidence whatsoever that he is focused or has much interest in health care at all” Schweizer said on Hannity.Feyerick the CNN host added that the White House had attacked the report “Jay Carney [is] saying that the report’s misleading and based on a ridiculously false premise those are his words David Gergen what do you think about this?”Gergen responded by saying the GAI report was a big deal and should not be dismissed. On Friday White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Obama and Sebelius meet “regularly” but their meetings were not recored on the visitors logs. Schweizer had previously noted that GAI also looked at White House visitor logs and found that whenever Sebelius went to the White House it was for social functions with “dozens or hundreds of people.” And he noted on Hannity that if Obama met with Sebelius and left the meeting off the books Sebelius would be the only cabinet secretary whose meetings with the White House were concealed.Gergen faulted the White House for this lack of contact and condemned the whole White House operation.“The fact that he was not meeting with her one-on-one I think frankly is not so much an indictment of her but of the White House operation” he said.Gergen said that “at the same time three years pass with no one-on-one meetings according to this Politico article. The president had 277 one-on-one meetings with other members of his cabinet.” Gergen referenced Schweizer’s Politico article in which he mentioned that “perhaps the insular White House team wanted to distance the president from the bureaucratic process in the hopes of granting him a halo of deniability if the launch failed.” Schweizer also noted “the lack of meetings reinforces the severity of what the New York Times describes as the ‘deeply dysfunctional relationship between the Department of Health and Human Services and its technology contractors and tensions between the White House chief of staff and senior health department officials.'”Feyerick the CNN host added that if health care reform “was so important to the president you would think that there was a lot more one-on-one interaction especially on something that’s so critical to him and his policy.” Princeton Professor Julian Zelizer who was also on the panel did not respond directly to the details of the GAI report only to say that “we have to be careful because as the White House said that [report] does come from a conservative organization.”The Government Accountability Institute though is a nonpartisan organization and its mission is to “investigate and expose crony capitalism misuse of taxpayer monies and other governmental corruption or malfeasance.” GAI headed by Schweizer has written several reports in recent years and has been criticized by both the Obama White House and House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH).,1
426,WASHINGTON — Barack Obama won the presidency by exploiting a political environment that devoured George W. Bush in a second term plagued by sinking credibility failed legislative battles fractured world relations and revolts inside his own party.President Obama is now threatened by a similar toxic mix. The disastrous rollout of his health care law not only threatens the rest of his agenda but also raises questions about his competence in the same way that the Bush administration’s botched response to Hurricane Katrina undermined any semblance of Republican efficiency.But unlike Mr. Bush who faced confrontational but occasionally cooperative Democrats Mr. Obama is battling a Republican opposition that has refused to open the door to any legislative fixes to the health care law and has blocked him at virtually every turn. A contrite-sounding Mr. Obama repeatedly blamed himself on Thursday for the failed health care rollout which he acknowledged had thrust difficult burdens on his political allies and hurt Americans’ trust in him.“It’s legitimate for them to expect me to have to win back some credibility on this health care law in particular and on a whole range of these issues in general” Mr. Obama said. The president did not admit to misleading people about whether they could keep their insurance but again expressed regret that his assurances turned out to be wrong.,1
427,"Can't afford the premiums. Don't need health insurance. Won't support Obamacare.These are some of the reasons why CNNMoney readers say they'll opt to pay a penalty for not having health insurance in 2014 rather than sign up for a policy in the state-based exchanges or through their companies.""I would love to have insurance but we just don't have the money"" said Sandra Czop 58 of Bloomingdale Ill. ""We need that $100 to put food on the table. We have no money to put gas in the car.""Czop a mortgage loan officer whose business is down 60% and whose husband is unemployed summed up the sentiments of many readers. Though subsidies are available to those earning less than 400% of the poverty level the premiums are still too high for many Americans.Have questions on Obamacare? Join our Facebook chat on Friday.For 2014 the penalty is either $95 per adult or 1% of family income whichever results in a larger fine. (Income is defined as total income above the filing threshold which is $10000 for an individual and $20000 for a family in 2013.) That's still a lot less than premiums which are generally $200 to $300 a month on average for a silver plan.So a person making $50000 would not be eligible for a subsidy and would pay full price -- typically around $2400 to $3600 a year in premiums -- for a plan. If he declined to get insurance he would only be subject to a $400 penalty for the year.A couple earning that amount would receive a roughly $1300 subsidy leaving them to pay about $4750 in premiums for the year. But that compares to a $300 penalty.For some folks health insurance just isn't a good deal. Take Jessica Birge 29 who is studying nursing and works as a medical assistant. Her job gives her $100 a month for medical expenses though she does have dental and vision coverage through her employer. But she doesn't have a lot of medical expenses since she rarely goes to the doctor opting instead to go to a local clinic for her annual exams.Though she knows she needs insurance in case she gets into an accident she doesn't think Obamacare is very affordable.""I don't really want to pay a penalty but it's more economical for me to pay $300 a year [in fines] than $200 to $300 a month for insurance I don't use"" said Birge acknowledging she may get insurance in several years when the penalties get more onerous.Some people are opting to remain uninsured even though they have access to coverage on the job. Since they don't go to the doctor much they just prefer to pay for their health care out of pocket.Christie Egeston 35 could get insurance at her lab job but instead she puts money into the flexible spending account at work to cover her yearly checkup.""I don't really feel I need health insurance"" said Egeston who lives in Avondale Estates Ga. ""If the penalty is less than what I'm paying for the year in insurance it balances out.""And of course there are people who will not sign up for Obamacare because they fundamentally oppose the idea of a health insurance requirement. That's the camp Jim Moore of Denver falls into.""I'm just so opposed to the legislation and Obama's big government agenda"" said Moore 62 a contract certified public accountant. ""There's no way I'm giving my health care records to the government. I and many people need to make a statement.""",1

The man is impressed. ""This beats Obamacare I hope"" he mutters to one of the workers. ""Do I burst his bubble?"" wonders Reina Diaz-Dempsey overseeing the operation. She doesn't. If he signs up it's a win-win whether he knows he's been ensnared by Obamacare or not.The polling has been around for a while: if you ask people about the various provisions of Obamacare they love it; if you ask them about Obamacare they hate it. Now that the program is about to kick off that's being confirmed on the ground . In Kentucky.That's absolutely why Republicans are frantic to try to find a way to stop Obamacare from starting. As the message about its benefits get out as people sign up and start receiving those benefits they're going to forget all about being scared of it and they're going to like it.But it's not a slam-dunk and the public education effort is key because Republican lies have taken hold with plenty of people. Erin Hoven an outreach worker with Kentucky Voices for Health and her efforts to do outreach and education on Obamacare faces those lies—repeated regularly by both of the state's Republican senators Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul—at every turn.A woman Hoben had been working with in Hazard called her recently to tell her that the tea party had urged her not to enroll because the exchange wasn’t happening. [Hoben] went door to door with a free lunch program in Laurel County. She met a mother in a trailer she recalls who believed she was going to jail if she didn't sign up for insurance. What startled Hoben was that the mother seemed to just erroneously accept the potential jail time as a fact of life. ""I quickly explained to her that was not going to happen"" Hoben says.Will these people believe it when Hoben or others tell them that none of this stuff is true? Not until they see the lies be disproved and they see it start working. That gives Republicans in the states one more chance to defeat Obamacare: sabotage it at the state level in its implementation like in the states where the new health care navigators  community workers hired under the law to help people navigate the new system are being hindered by onerous new requirements and regulations.Because the worst thing in the world for Republicans is having more people get affordable health care.",1

""Michelle Snyder is not responsible for the debacle. Hold me accountable for the debacle. I'm responsible.""Despite widespread technical problems and meager enrollment at the outset the administration announced that the number of enrollees through the health care site has surpassed 1 million.

430,On Wednesday Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) said it was “inexcusable” and “unpardonable” that President Barack Obama did not meet one-on-one with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius since Obamacare passed over three years ago.On Fox News’s Hannity host Sean Hannity referenced the shocking Government Accountability Institute report when asking Lee whether he knew if Sebelius has met with Obama in one-on-one meetings.“Not to my knowledge” Lee answered before saying “this is inexcusable” and “absolutely unpardonable.”Lee who was the architect of the strategy to defund Obamacare and one of the fiercest opponents of the healthcare overhaul continued by saying “there was this little oversight in the launching of this significant an enterprise” and Obamacare is “so much more than about the website.” Lee said ultimately Obamacare is about the “fundamental unfairness and unworkability of the law.”At a House subcommittee hearing on Wednesday Sebelius was flustered when asked to give specific evidence that she and Obama have met “regularly.” Rep. Phil Gingrey (R-GA) who is on the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health exclusively told Breitbart News that he will ask Sebelius for specific dates of those alleged meetings.The White House and the Health and Human Services Department have claimed Obama and Sebelius meet “regularly” but have not provided any firm dates except for an alleged meeting last Thursday which was a day after the GAI report was released. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said there are many meetings between Obama and cabinet secretaries that are not on the public record.When Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large and Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer broke the GAI report on Fox News’s Hannity last Wednesday though he mentioned that GAI examined the White House visitor logs and found that whenever Sebelius went to the White House it was for social functions with “dozens or hundreds of people.” He noted on Hannity that if Obama met with Sebelius and left the meetings off the books Sebelius would be the only cabinet secretary whose meetings with the White House were concealed.The Government Accountability Institute report found that since Obamacare was signed into law on March 23 2010 Obama met with “various Cabinet secretaries a total of 277 times” but his presidential schedule did not “document a single one-on-one meeting” with Sebelius. There was “one instance of Secretary Sebelius meeting jointly with the President and Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner.”According to the White House schedule Obama “met with secretaries from the Departments of Defense State and Treasury for 263 (95%) out of his 277 face-to-face meetings.” Obama also had meetings with “secretaries from the Departments of Agriculture Education Justice Energy Homeland Security Interior Labor Health and Human Services Veterans Affairs… [including] two meetings with the Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus (not an official Cabinet level post).”Schweizer had previously said there was no evidence on the White House schedule that showed Obama cared about Obamacare.“In the case of President Obama if you look at his calendar there is no evidence whatsoever that he is focused or has much interest in health care at all” Schweizer said on Hannity on Wednesday.,1
431,By Roberta Rampton and David Morgan WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama who has portrayed himself as surprised by technical problems with the government's new health care website was briefed last spring on a detailed consultant's report that warned of system failure White House spokesman Jay Carney said on Tuesday. Carney said the president's familiarity with the report and recommendations by McKinsey & Co did not contradict previous statements from the White House that described Obama as surprised by the scope of flaws in HealthCare.gov since it opened for people to enroll for insurance coverage on October 1. Obama was told the problems identified by McKinsey were being addressed Carney said. After reeling from technical problems at its website for more than six weeks the Obama administration on Tuesday also said that it is still months away from completing the back end of the system including functions needed to finalize federal subsidies for consumers who buy health plans. Administration officials said the complicated information technology system's financial management function would not be completed until mid-January weeks after the first enrollees are scheduled to begin receiving benefits under the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010 as Obama's signature domestic policy. Julie Bataille a spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) played down the January timeframe saying the financial management functions are not among the high priority fixes aimed at ensuring a smooth operation for consumers to shop enroll in coverage and make their first month's premium payment. But the ability of the administration to deliver federal premium tax credits as partial premium payments for qualifying consumers is a vital segment of the function of the new online marketplace. Also not due until January are functions involving risk adjustments for insurers and the monthly reconciliation of enrollment data. The McKinsey report released Monday night by a Republican-controlled House of Representatives committee is the most detailed analysis made public to date of the difficulties the site was facing late in its development. It warned the government of the potential for system failure that could make the health care exchanges inaccessible to consumers trying to buy insurance through them suggesting that there was not enough time before October to make all the repairs. Release of the report by the Republican chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee was part of a broad effort by Republicans to discredit the health care program and to portray the Obama administration as incompetent in implementing the health care law. DEMOCRATS JOINING CRITICISM Democrats are increasingly joining the chorus of criticism. Representative Elijah Cummings a senior Democrat and ally of Obama called on Tuesday for a White House shakeup over the handling of the rollout of the healthcare law commonly called Obamacare. The website is an online exchange that allows consumers to shop for coverage under the law which mandated that Americans have health insurance and created new marketplaces to buy and sell policies. In a separate House hearing Republicans portrayed the website as not only broken but not secure for personal information of consumers. Three security experts testified that HealthCare.gov was so insecure for consumers that they believed it should be shut down until fixed. Obama administration officials responded that the site was safe. The rollout of Obama's signature domestic policy has hurt the popularity of the initiative but the decline has been fairly modest a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed on Monday. Forty-one percent of Americans expressed support for Obamacare in a survey conducted from Thursday to Monday. That was down 3 percentage points from a Reuters/Ipsos poll taken from September 27 to October 1. Opposition to the healthcare law stood at 59 percent in the latest poll versus 56 percent in the earlier survey. (Additional reporting by Caren Bohan; Editing by Fred Barbash and Grant McCool),1
432,After an initial phase of shell-shocked damage control President Barack Obama’s efforts to save his signature health care law — and with it his second term and his place in U.S. history — are taking on an aggressive tone.“Let’s face it a lot of us didn’t realize that passing the law was the easy part” Obama told scores of supporters late Monday at a posh Washington hotel.The new approach — emphasizing Affordable Care Act benefits that are already in effect and don’t require navigating a botched website promoting the law’s success stories blaming Republicans and the news media in equal measure for the bad news — also comes with a renewed focus on issues that helped unite the winning coalition of his 2012 re-election campaign.The president has stepped up calls for Congress to pass by year’s end legislation overhauling America’s immigration policy. On Tuesday he’ll meet with top executives to make the argument that doing so would help the economy.And the Democratic-held Senate voted 61-30 late Monday to advance a bill to outlaw workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation with seven Republicans breaking ranks to side with the majority. “Common sense” Obama told activists backing his Organizing for Action group at the St. Regis Hotel.Amid headlines screaming out Obamacare’s setbacks White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters Monday that the president’s “No. 1 priority has and will be economic progress.”That's two issues that rally pivotal segments of the public behind the Democratic position while dividing Republicans and one that remains atop the list of voter concerns. Is the president in campaign mode one year after his re-election and one year before the 2014 midterms?“I just promise that in November of 2013 I haven't had a single conversation about 2014” Carney insisted Monday.Riiiiiiight. The White House has said that the president will travel to Dallas on Wednesday for an event with health care volunteers — and then fundraising for the Democratic Senate campaign fund. On Friday after a stop in New Orleans to discuss export growth Obama will head to Miami for more Democratic fundraisers.Story continuesAnd somehow neither the president nor Vice President Joe Biden mentioned the Affordable Care Act directly when they headlined separate rallies for Virginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe on Sunday and Monday. His GOP opponent Ken Cuccinelli has bet his chances for an upset win on opposition to the health care law.But for the first time in its brief history the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act’s fate isn’t up to congressional arm-twisters or White House negotiators or even the voters. It’s up to a phalanx of experts (affectionately dubbed “the nerds” by some in the West Wing) doing surprisingly literal damage control trying to fix HealthCare.govDemocrats and Republicans alike say that repairing the site by the administration’s self-imposed early December deadline could dramatically reshape the Obamacare battlefield.“It comes down to the website which has really been a manifestation of people’s fears. It validates people’s concerns about the law” a top aide to a Democratic senator up for re-election in 2014 told Yahoo News.“The best thing that could happen for us is for the fix to be good enough the enrollment drive good enough that it makes what happened in the last two months seem like it never happened” said the aide speaking anonymously to discuss the situation candidly. “We need this law to work.”After that Democrats say the law could benefit from steadily growing numbers of Americans getting benefits.But “this fix the website the enrollment drive that comes next it has got to dwarf what came before make it look like a campaign for elementary school class treasurer” the Democratic aide said.“I won’t say that fixing the website two months after it launched is a huge victory but the website was an obvious easily understood failure we had nothing to do with” one Republican congressional aide told Yahoo News. “We’ll still push on the job losses and the ‘if you like your plan you can keep it.’”Republicans have seized on Obama’s refrain as evidence of dishonesty. Major news outlets have highlighted the many thousands of people losing their existing health care coverage because it does not meet the law’s more generous requirements.On Monday Obama himself tried to retroactively add a little fine print. “What we said was you could keep it if it hasn’t changed since the law was passed” he told supporters.That was in the legislation — plans that existed before it became law (and remained unchanged) were grandfathered in. New plans or those that underwent modifications had to adhere to the ACA’s tougher standards.The White House points out that plans disappeared all the time before the Affordable Care Act — and that many of those vanishing now offer precious little actual coverage. Obama aides also underline that the higher cost of options provided under the new law reflect more generous benefits while emphasizing that many Americans will qualify for subsidies to make it easier to buy health insurance.But those qualifiers weren’t in Obama’s public campaigning.“Nobody is changing what you’ve got if you’re happy with it” the president said the day he signed the measure into law. “If you like your doctor you will be able to keep your doctor.”The White House also has deployed more standard weapons — an array of what it calls “fact checks” positive anecdotes to counter the (frequently dubious) horror stories and links to positive coverage.Outreach to worried congressional Democrats has been uneven. After the problem-plagued Oct. 1 rollout it wasn’t until Oct. 30 that all Senate Democratic offices received their first White House-drafted talking points — a delay one Democratic leadership aide blamed on the two-week government shutdown.(UPDATE: Another Senate Democratic leadership aide wrote in to dispute that account saying that all Senate Democratic offices “were provided with message guidance and talking points consistently both from the White House and HHS [Department of Health and Human Services] throughout October.”)At the same time the administration has held at least 20 briefings this year for lawmakers of both parties and 10 more for staff.“These briefings were both offered proactively to and done at the request of lawmakers from both sides of the aisle and are in addition to regular constant outreach conducted at the staff level between White House staffers and Hill staffers on a daily basis” said White House spokesman Eric Schultz. “They also are in addition to four meetings the president himself had in early October with House Democrats House Republicans Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans. “Obama aides have taken the president’s lead and adopted a freshly combative tone — but that may be in part because they know things will get worse before they get better.In mid-November the administration is due to release the number of Americans who have successfully enrolled in health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act.Even with day-by-day improvements to HealthCare.gov administration officials expect that number to be low touching off a fresh round of criticisms.“We're only one month into a six-month open enrollment period” Obama said Monday. “It’s not as if this is a one-day sale or something. So we've just got to keep on working.”,1
433,"By Steve Holland and Roberta Rampton WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama promised on Saturday that his troubled healthcare website was just weeks away from a cure as he struggled to convince Americans he is on top of what has become a self-inflicted wound to his signature first-term achievement. His administration unveiled a plan on Friday to make Obamacare insurance marketplaces on healthcare.gov - a website riddled with error messages long delays and bugs - work better by the end of November. It was the end to an embarrassing week where Obama discovered he had overshot on an Oct 1. promise of a website that would make shopping for health insurance as easy as buying ""a plane ticket on Kayak or a TV on Amazon."" ""As you may have heard the site isn't working the way it's supposed to yet"" Obama said in his weekly Saturday address - an understatement after days of reports of people being shut out of the system. ""In the coming weeks we are going to get it working as smoothly as it's supposed to"" he added. Obama had stood firm against Republican attempts to defund or delay the healthcare law known popularly as Obamacare - efforts that led to a 16-day government shutdown this month. He and his top officials had warned publicly before October 1 that there could be ""glitches"" but the White House has been scrambling to control the damage from a rollout that was far worse than expected. The depth of the design flaws has raised questions about why the Obama administration was so insistent on starting the enrollments on October 1 when the system was clearly not ready - and laid bare the president's mistake in raising expectations about how good the website was going to be. ""Either they made assumptions that were too optimistic and were caught off guard or they knew that the difficulties would be greater than the public understood but chose not to say so"" said Bill Galston a Brookings Institution expert who was a domestic policy adviser to Democratic President Bill Clinton. ""It may be some of both."" CRISIS MANAGEMENT 101 Obama adviser Jeffrey Zients appointed on Tuesday to figure out how to manage the complicated fixes for the website was an unannounced participant on a conference call with health reporters on Friday afternoon. Zients gave a deadline although he cautioned there was a lot of work to do. ""By the end of November healthcare.gov will work smoothly for the vast majority of users"" he said. Borrowing from the lexicon of homebuilders Zients said he had hired a ""general contractor"" to manage the many contractors on the project and developed a ""punch list"" of dozens of problems to address. The message followed classic corporate crisis management strategy said Peter LaMotte a senior vice president at Levick a firm that devises communications strategies for large corporations and organizations. ""State the facts be clear be transparent and then shut up"" LaMotte said. ""That is what we often recommend to our clients."" That deadline buys the administration and tech experts time to iron out the bugs in the website before millions of Americans give up trying to use it LaMotte said. But he added ""People are going to hold you to that date."" Norm Ornstein a political analyst at the American Enterprise Institute said the date was ""comforting"" because it came from Zients who is known for being a ""straight shooter"" with private-sector management expertise. ""He's not making it up. It does not serve his interests to pick a date without a clue as to whether you can make it"" Ornstein said noting Zients would become Obama's top economic adviser at the White House on January 1. ""His credibility is at stake here"" Ornstein said. POLITICAL BREATHING ROOM Republicans are using the problems to push for a delay to the requirement that Americans buy insurance by March 31. ""Despite hundreds of millions of taxpayers dollars invested the website still does not work for most"" Fred Upton chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee said in the Republican reply to Obama's Saturday address. Upton's panel will grill Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius at a hearing next week. Zients' Friday announcement will take some pressure off Sebelius in the hearing said John Ullyot who works on crisis communications as a managing director at High Lantern Group. But Ullyot a former Senate Republican aide said the plan would have had more punch had it been presented earlier in the week by the ""much louder megaphone"" of either Sebelius or Obama. ""They had a full week of drip drip drip in the media and you never want to have that"" he said. Once the website is fixed officials will face another communications challenge. They will need to concentrate on luring back to the site those people who gave up trying to access it in the initial phases said a former Obama administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""I think that people are going to like the site and sign up for it. The problem is once a user has a bad experience at a website they're not usually going to want to go back to it"" the official said.

434,"The Canadian PressWASHINGTON — One by one the Republican leaders of Congress have made the trip to Mar-a-Lago to see Donald Trump. Kevin McCarthy visited after the deadly Jan 6 Capitol insurrection counting on the former president's help to win back control of the House in 2022. The chair of the Senate Republican campaign committee Rick Scott stopped by to enlist Trump in efforts to regain the Senate. Lindsey Graham goes to play golf. But missing from the appearances has been perhaps the most powerful Republican elected official in the country Mitch McConnell a onetime ally who ushered the former president’s legislative and judicial agenda to fruition but now claims to want nothing to do with Trump. The very public pilgrimages and the noticeable refusal to make one have placed congressional Republicans at a crossroads with one branch of the party keeping close to Trump hoping to harness the power of his political brand and loyal voters for their campaigns and the other splitting away trying to chart the GOP’s post-Trump future. With no obvious heir apparent or leader-in-waiting the standoff between the party’s two highest-ranking figures poses an uneasy test of political wills and loyalties particularly for the rank-and-file lawmakers in Congress dependent on both men for their political livelihoods. Congress has become more Trump-like in the former president’s absence as a new generation of Trump-aligned lawmakers emerges particularly in the Senate and more centrist Republicans announce their retirements. “We've got enough problems without fighting within ourselves"" said Sen. Tommy Tuberville R-Ala. who was swept into office this year with Trump's support. “You know being a football coach that’s what I would tell our players and coaches” he said. ""You bring your whole team down. So that’s pretty much how I think about this. As a team we don’t need arguing between teammates. We just need them to be on the same page.” The stark fallout was on display at the Republican donor retreat when Trump lashed into McConnell as a “stone-cold loser” but then was feted with an honorary award from Scott the National Republican Senatorial Committee chair launching the campaign efforts. Asked about it later McConnell responded with perhaps the most cutting retort of all: He simply ignored Trump. “What I'm concentrating on is the future” said McConnell the Senate Republican leader. Unlike past presidents who did not win a second term the end of Trump’s presidency has not brought closure as much as it has a lingering uncertainty on Capitol Hill about the party’s pathway back to power. He is promising to return to the political stage perhaps for his own bid for the White House. But more immediately he is being enlisted by GOP leaders in support of congressional candidates to win back the House and Senate. As McConnell tries to position Republicans as the opposition to President Joe Biden's agenda it is clear that while he is the leader of the Senate Trump remains for now the leader of the GOP. “Is it ideal? I don’t know. But is it sustainable? Sure” said Scott Jennings a GOP strategist and longtime McConnell confidant. “It’s easy to see how they both could frankly be successful in their individual goals without ever speaking another word to each other.” Jennings said McConnell and Trump aren’t jockeying for power as much as bringing complementary skills to the campaigns ahead. The former president can rev up his base of supporters with rally-style speeches while McConnell can assemble the campaign strategies and candidates to regain control of the Senate. “One of them is in party-building mode which is McConnell and the other one is in axe-grinding mode” he said. “They don’t have to be golfing buddies” he said. The congressional leaders want and expect Trump to play a role in next year’s midterm elections as they try to wrest control from Democrats who have the slimmest majorities in the House and Senate in recent memory. “God yes” Graham R-S.C. said recently. “He’s sitting on a mountain of money and has a 90% approval rating among Republicans.” McCarthy the House Republican leader said Trump has been helpful so far in House GOP campaign efforts. “Like all of the former presidents they help they’re engaged in many different ways” McCarthy said. Yet as Trump assembles a political operation from his private club in Florida his biggest priority so far appears to be trying to defeat some of the party’s most prominent lawmakers including Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney who were among those voting to impeach him over the Jan. 6 insurrection. While Trump has also endorsed some GOP incumbents other Republican lawmakers particularly in the Senate have simply announced they are retiring. Asked specifically if Trump should quit attacking the Republican Party's leaders McCarthy demurred. “The No. 1 thing I want to have happen is make sure the next century is the American century” he said. “If the next century is going to be ours we’re going to have to change administrations we're going to have to change Congress. That’s my focus.” The deadly riot has become a political line of demarcation on Capitol Hill over those GOP lawmakers who stood with Trump to overturn Biden’s victory during the Electoral College tally. Trump was impeached for inciting the insurrection as he urged a mob of supporters to “fight like hell” for his presidency. One of the lawmakers Trump recently endorsed is Alabama GOP Rep. Mo Brooks who is running for the Senate seat that will be vacant with the retirement of longtime GOP Sen. Richard Shelby. Brooks had been a leader of the House efforts to challenge the election results and joined the rally outside the White House on Jan. 6. Trump encouraged the mob that day to head to the Capitol. Five people died including a Trump supporter shot by police and a police officer who died later after fighting the mob of Trump loyalists who stormed the Capitol. At a dinner last month at Mar-a-Lago Scott said he encouraged the president's support to win back the Senate — after the primaries are settled. Many Republicans recall the 2010 election when they won back control of the House but not the Senate because some of the candidates who won primary elections on the tea party wave were too conservative or hardline to appeal to voters statewide. Shelby said he wished the former president and McConnell would ""put their differences aside"" minding President Ronald Reagan's admonition not to battle each other. “Republicans fighting Republicans benefits who? The Democrats” said Shelby. “I wish he’d stay out of all the Senate races but he’s not” Shelby said about Trump. “He’s got a lot of energy he’s got a dedicated following. I don’t think he’s looking for retirement.” Lisa Mascaro The Associated Press",1
435,"A single mom from Washington State who was cited by President Obama as an Affordable Care Act success story now says she’ll go uninsured and calls the program a “treadmill of bureaucracy.”Washington State Wire reports that Jessica Sanford 48 discovered that she is no longer eligible for a large subsidy that would have lowered her monthly premium to $169 per month. Instead Sanford would now be forced to pay nearly four times as much $621 for coverage.Sanford told the paper she believes the government should shut down the entire healthcare.gov site until the site’s issues are resolved. “In my opinion they ought to shut it down and just get all of it straightened out.”That's a complete 180 from what Sanford thought she was signing up for last month when Obama touted her as an Affordable Care Act success story.During a White House Rose Garden ceremony on Oct. 21 Obama read an email from Sanford in which she thanks the president for offering her help in obtaining a low-cost high-quality coverage plan.""I recently received a letter from a woman named Jessica Sanford in Washington state” Obama said. “And here's what she wrote: 'I am a single mom no child support self-employed. And I haven't had insurance for 15 years because it's too expensive. I was crying the other day when I signed up so much stress lifted.' ""Sanford works as a court reporter and says she makes just under $50000 a year. Her 14-year-old son requires a monthly prescription that is expensive because it must come from a compounded pharmacy. She said she thought the originally promised $452 monthly premium subsidy would help her close the financial gap.“To think I would finally be covered if anything happened – I was so relieved” she told the Washington Wire.However CNN reports that in the days following Obama's Rose Garden ceremony Sanford received a letter telling her that her tax credit had been taken away meaning she won’t be able to afford coverage. Officials reportedly told her that they made a mistake in calculating her benefits. Sanford is reportedly one of 8000 people in Washington State who have received letters informing them that their promised subsidies have been reduced or removed.“This is it. I'm not getting insurance"" Sanford told CNN. ""That's where it stands right now unless they fix it.""A representative from Washington State’s HealthPlanFinder said they are looking into Sanford’s case and will try to help her find a more affordable plan.",1
436,Just a week before young adults return home for the end of year holidays Organizing for America is debuting a video imploring parents to interrupt their time with their children to promote the benefits of Obamacare in a last-ditch attempt to ease millennial dissatisfaction with President Obama.The video debuting on BarackObama.com and promoted through various social media arrives on the eve of a joint President and First Lady event designed to target mothers of uninsured millennials as they arrive home for their holidays.In the clip a mother and father call their son presumably about to drive home for Christmas dinner and warn him that they have something “very important” to talk to him about. The son spends the entire drive home fretting about the worst case scenario (“Your father and I are moving in with you!”) and inexplicably expecting arbitrary pop culture references (“I am the one who knocks!“). The “reveal” that the parents want to talk about health insurance is predictable as is the fact that the son is above all relieved. “That’s it?” he asks.The ad titled “Get Ready To Have The Talk” plays like an ’80s anti-drug PSA urging parents to use the holidays as a stage for an intervention to stop something unhealthy in their children’s lives. The fact that it happens at the dinner itself (though the accompanying Twitter graphic shows the actor playing the son mid-hot chocolate later in the night) instructs parents to directly address the Obama administration’s agenda in the middle of what for many celebrating the night is a religious celebration devoid of political meaning.The targeted advertising appears to be a last-minute attempt to reverse devastating trends in the Affordable Care Act’s and the President’s nosedive in the public opinion polls as the year wanes and HealthCare.gov continues to fail millions. A Harvard Institute of Politics poll released this month shows 57% of young Americans ages 18-29 disapprove of the ACA and 52% would support removing the President from office. The targeting of parents also appears to be a direct reaction to dwindling support for Obamacare among white women.Apparently the White House hopes changing mothers’ minds will cause a trickle down effect that reaches the young uninsured. Or at least that is what Democrats should hope the White House is doing because the video demonstrates a prodigious lack of understanding of youth culture today.It makes sense. Young people today were not the young people of five years ago–the young people who truly believed in President Obama–and to the White House it seems that all these new young people do is quote Breaking Bad at each other in their plaid onesies. It’s a Hail Mary pass from an administration that was previously unstoppable in reaching out to young Americans one perhaps that is their only move after HealthCare.gov failed so extraordinarily that Ezra Klein wondered aloud why someone in the administration hasn’t been fired over it.We’ll have to wait until next week to see just how many parents take this advice but the outlook doesn’t seem to be so bright if this is the last PR resort.,1
437,"Republican Sen. John Cornyn -- citing Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius' recent admission that felons potentially could become ObamaCare navigators as well as new undercover video showing questionable behavior by these officials -- called Monday for the program to be halted.Cornyn ripped the program after conservative activist James O'Keefe released a new video that appears to depict ObamaCare navigators in Cornyn's home state of Texas encouraging applicants to fib on their applications.""This behavior is unacceptable and is yet another broken piece of a deeply flawed system. The Obama administration should stop this program immediately"" Cornyn said in a statement. ""Texans should not be purposefully misled and more importantly their privacy should not be put at risk.""The ""navigators"" are workers who are supposed to help people sign up for health care coverage under the new health law.Reports continue to roll in about problems with the program after a group formed from the ruins of ACORN announced earlier this year it was getting in on the sign-up effort.The United Labor Unions Council Local 100 a New Orleans-based nonprofit said in September it would take part in a multi-state ""navigator"" drive to help people enroll in President Obama's health care plan. The labor council was established by ACORN founder Wade Rathke after his larger group was broken up amid scandal in 2009.The video from O'Keefe who played a big role in dismantling ACORN adds to the concern.The newly released video from O'Keefe's Project Veritas are similar to past sting operations his group has conducted including against ACORN. Using hidden-camera footage the latest shows actors posing as ObamaCare applicants -- and unsuspecting navigators giving questionable advice.In one workers with a community center in Irving Texas are shown telling one actor that he shouldn't reveal anything about smoking because it could jack up his premiums.""You lie because your premiums will be higher"" one says.Another chimes in ""Don't tell them that.""In another video from a National Urban League office in Dallas an actor is told not to declare income he has earned on the side because it could cause problems with the government.""Don't get yourself in trouble by declaring it now"" one worker says.""Yeah it didn't happen"" another says.""Our organization has taken immediate steps to address the actions of the identified employees and investigate the full context of what occurred in our Dallas and Irving offices"" a statement released by The Urban League of Greater Dallas said.""In addition we support actions by the Department of Health & Human Services to decertify the three Navigators-in-training featured in the video and The Urban League of Greater Dallas has suspended these employees until further notice"" the statement said.O'Keefe's group says it will release more videos of its ""ObamaCare investigations"" in the coming weeks that will show fraud and abuse in the system.""This investigation shows just how vulnerable Obamacare is to fraud"" O'Keefe said in a statement.",1
438,Story highlights Obama says in interview with NBC he's sorry Some people are losing their health coverage due to Affordable Care Act Obama said previously Americans could keep their plans if they liked them NEW: House will vote next week on bill allowing Americans to keep their health plans(CNN) —President Barack Obama apologized Thursday to those Americans whose insurance plans are being canceled due to the federal health law he championed even though he said repeatedly they could keep their coverage if they liked.“I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me” he told NBC News in an exclusive interview.“We’ve got to work hard to make sure that they know we hear them and we are going to do everything we can to deal with folks who find themselves in a tough position as a consequence of this” he added.Obama’s comments come days after he attempted to clarify what he meant when he assured Americans in previous years that they would be able to keep their plans under the Affordable Care Act a controversy that is prompting legislation in Congress to address it.Obama further alters ‘you can keep your plan’ pledgeRepublicans have hammered Obama over the promise since insurers began discontinuing coverage for some of the 12 million Americans who buy individual policies on the private market that don’t meet Obamacare requirements for more comprehensive care.GOP moves past troubled Obamacare websiteInsurance companies appear to be doing this for a variety of reasons; some are pulling all their plans from certain states where they have fewer subscribers in order to save money.In many cases affected policyholders are being squeezed. They either don’t qualify for subsidies to lower the cost of new premiums or they may have to pay more in the health care exchange marketplace.When Obama says he’s looking to fix it he primarily means steps that can be taken administratively senior administration officials said.Some experts suggest one possible approach would be to ask insurers to delay the cancellation of plans and extend them into the New Year so that people are not left without insurance. That has been done for example in the state of California.But House Speaker John Boehner said an Obama apology was in order and said the Republican-led House had its own plan in mind.“What Americans want to hear is that the President is going to keep his promise. That’s why the House will vote next week to allow anyone with a health care plan they like to keep it” Boehner said. “If the President is sincerely sorry that he misled the American people the very least he can do is support this bipartisan effort. Otherwise this apology doesn’t amount to anything.”The administration eventually knew that many policies would be changed by the insurance carriers after Obamacare was introduced and the associated political uproar since its October 1 online rollout has also angered Democrats and fueled Republican efforts to extend related controversies onto the campaign trail.Vulnerable Senate Democrats voice concernsIn 2010 the Health and Human Services Department estimated that 40% to 67% of individual plans would eventually lose their “grandfathered” status which only was conferred if a plan was purchased before the health care law was approved in 2010.Although Obama said the “buck stops” with him on Obamacare problems to date – including the rocky rollout of the website – he still was resolute that his initiative to provide coverage for the uninsured and better coverage for many others would be better for the country.“Most of the folks who … got these cancellation letters they’ll be able to get better care at the same cost or cheaper in these new marketplaces” Obama said also noting that “we have to make sure” people do not feel as if they’ve been betrayed by an effort carried out with their best interests in mind.“They’ll have more choice they’ll have more competition. They’re part of a bigger pool. The insurance companies are going to be hungry for their business. So the majority of folks will end up being better off” he said.Key elements of the health law prohibit discrimination for pre-existing conditions and require new plans cover maternity care mental health and other areas. The program was developed to put comprehensive care within reach of millions of uninsured Americans.About 95% of legal U.S. residents receive health insurance through private employers or the federal government the Obama administration says. But more than 48 million Americans don’t have any coverage.Debunking 4 Obamacare myths: Both sides get it wrongObama’s apology comes a week after similar refrains were made by Vice President Joe Biden and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius regarding the botched Obamacare online rollout.Five things we learned from Obamacare recordsWH: Chief tech officer too busy for congressional testimonyAsked if he thinks Americans will be able to trust what he says in the future Obama said he thinks he’ll ultimately be “judged on whether” Obamacare is better for Americans overall.“When you try to do something big like make our health care system better … there are going to be problems along the way even if ultimately what you’re doing is going to make a whole lot of people better off and I hope that people will look at the end product and they’re going to be able to look back and say you know what we now have protections we didn’t have before” he said.In the NBC interview Obama reiterated the administration’s line that he’s “confident” a “majority of people” will be able to use the website and apply for insurance by November 30. But he did not say whether he would push back the March 31 deadline to enroll or the penalty for those who do not purchase insurance.Obamacare depends on younger healthier Americans to buy into the program and pay premiums to offset costs for covering older people who need more health care. Those without insurance who do not sign up for a plan face a fine.What else could go wrong with Obamacare?A Gallup poll conducted just over a week ago showed 36% of Americans said they didn’t think that in the long run the Affordable Care Act would make much of a difference to their family’s health care situation. Just over a third said the health care law would make matters worse and one in four said that Obamacare would make things better.Opinion: Here’s the truth about ObamacareCNN’s Brianna Keilar Gloria Borger and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.,1
439,Before the dust settled on the news that the Obama Administration was delaying the intrusive employer mandate until 2015 a new 606-page regulation was issued on Friday by the Department of Health and Human Services stating it would now rely on self-reported income and employment verification in the state-run exchanges under ObamaCare. In other words a welcome mat for fraud.This is another startling development which is becoming part of a larger theme as ObamaCare is rolled out to the public. It is clear that the Affordable Care Act is unworkable. For those like myself who opposed it from the start we saw the writing on the wall early on as President Obama’s signature health care legislation was rammed through the halls of Congress. If only then-Speaker Pelosi had insisted that her party read the legislation before passing it maybe some of this would have come to light earlier on. While the eventual passage of the legislation was certain under Democrat control of Congress maybe some Democrats now sounding the alarm about the devastating impact of the legislation would have done so sooner if they had read it while it was still a bill not only after it became law.As of now ObamaCare is $1 trillion over budget; I say “as of now” because it’s almost certain that with the elimination of the anti-fraud measures the cost will further skyrocket and there are examples to back up this theory.In January the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services began an effort to remove ineligible people from the state’s Medicaid rolls. The initial audit concluded that of the first 20500 recipients screened it was recommended 13709 be removed from eligibility. The Chicago Tribune reports that “since 2000 Illinois Medicaid rolls have doubled from fewer than 1.4 million people to nearly 2.8 million or more than 1 in 5 Illinoisans.” In part because of the rising Medicaid rolls the state’s backlog of unpaid bills is expected to grow to $21 billion by fiscal year 2018.States are fascinating laboratories of democracy that can provide brilliant blueprints for other states and the federal government to follow. However states can also serve as flashing red lights when plans go wrong. Illinois is a great example of how a lack of anti-fraud measures can drain a state’s coffers. As President Obama’s home state he would be wise to take notice.President Reagan famously said “trust but verify.” In light of the notion that the U.S. health care system makes up one-eighth of the economy it’s my hope that this administration will grasp hold of this sensible advice.,1
440,"7 years agoWashington (CNN) – House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said Sunday neither she nor President Barack Obama misled the American people when they said during the run-up to the passage of Obamacare that people could keep their health insurance plans.Pelosi clarified their remarks saying they only meant people could keep their plans if they had already signed up before Obama signed the bill in 2010.[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='gregclarycnn']""(Obama is) gracious and he's taking responsibility” Pelosi said on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” “But that doesn't mean there's anything in the law that said if you like what you had before 2010 you couldn't keep it.""The Affordable Care Act allows for people to keep their health plans if they had signed up before the bill was enacted - but not after.Fact Check: If you liked your health plan you can keep your health planThe president repeatedly said during the campaign for health care reform that if people liked their insurance plans they could keep them.Following many health plan cancellation notices – a million in California alone – Obama told the American people Thursday he’s responsible for not having been clear.“I completely get how upsetting this can be for a lot of Americans particularly after assurances they heard from me that if they had a plan that they liked they could keep it. And to those Americans I hear you loud and clear” Obama said.The President offered a short-term fix allowing people who have had plans canceled to remain on them for an additional year.On Friday the House passed a bill with bipartisan support allowing people to stay on their plans permanently. It’s unclear whether that bill will have a chance to move forward or if Obama might even veto it if it passed in the Senate.The fumbling – Obama’s word - rollout of Obamacare may take a toll on Democratic prospects in next year’s midterm elections even though the party came out on top in opinion polls following a government shutdown last month. That shutdown now seems like a distant memory.""I don't think you can tell what will happen next year but I will tell you this: Democrats stand tall in support of the Affordable Care Act” Pelosi said.“What's important about it is that the American people get served not who gets re-elected.”",0
441,California’s health insurance exchange vastly overstated the number of online hits it received Tuesday during the rollout of Obamacare.State officials said the Covered California website got 645000 hits during the first day of enrollment far fewer than the 5 million it reported Tuesday.The state exchange had cited the 5 million figure as a sign of strong consumer interest and a major reason people had so much difficulty using its $313-million online enrollment system.Dana Howard a spokesman for Covered California said the error was the result of internal miscommunication.Advertisement“Someone misspoke and thought it was indeed 5 million hits. That was incorrect” he said.Full coverage: Obamacare rolls outHoward said the revised Web traffic still represents a huge response. He said the number of unique online visitors Tuesday was 514000 and the state received 19000 calls.Meantime Californians were still running into computer problems and long hold times during the second day of enrollment under the federal healthcare law.AdvertisementThose glitches have prompted Covered California to shut down its online enrollment system twice.First the state took it down from 9 p.m. Tuesday until 7 a.m. Wednesday to make technical fixes. Then Covered California took enrollment offline for two hours Wednesday morning because information on health plans wasn’t loading properly according to the state.These problems could frustrate consumers and hamper enrollment efforts. California is trying to sign up more than 2 million people through next year the most of any state.Some consumers said they were able to create an account on the state’s website at www.coveredca.com but the system crashed after that.AdvertisementPeople calling for information continued to face wait times of 30 minutes or more. Some call-center representatives at the exchange told people they were having trouble accessing the state system themselves further slowing down the enrollment process.State officials say they are taking steps to remedy these service issues. California has about 300 people answering calls now and it plans to add an additional 150 employees next month at a call center opening in Fresno.Supporters of the healthcare law said there’s still time to iron out problems before coverage takes effect Jan. 1 on these new exchange plans. Enrollment runs through March 31.ALSO:AdvertisementObamacare Q&A: Explaining your optionsInsurers limiting doctors hospitals in new exchange marketDemand is strong as Obamacare enrollment starts in California,1
442,As the first hearings on the failed implementation of Obamacare begin Thursday with the testimony of the healthcare.gov contractors before the House Energy and Commerce Committee Democrats have already developed their strategy for blunting Republican criticism. They will a) assert that repairs are being made; b) attack critics for “politicizing” the problems; and c) demand the GOP join efforts to support the law.Along the way Democrats will cling mightily to the straw man upon which they relied throughout 2009-2010 during the debate over the law: namely that if you oppose Obamacare you are opposed to providing health care to the working poor to those with pre-existing conditions to the temporarily unemployed. They will cover the foreseeable failure of a policy that has already hurt millions with the glory of noble intentions.Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) Ranking Member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform previewed the Democrats’ strategy on Oct. 22 in an interview with Wolf Blitzer on CNN’s The Situation Room. Cummings made clear that his party will try to deflect criticism of Obamacare by casting it as the latest example of alleged Republican overreach on Obama administration scandals:BLITZER: I know you must be very frustrated. Were you surprised to learn that apparently no one was really in charge of this Web site rollout even though they had a couple years to plan for it? CUMMINGS: Yes a bit surprised. But Wolf what we’ve got to concentrate now on is making sure that the Web site works. And I’m hoping that Republicans and Democrats will see this not as a partisan issue but as one that we have to make work for all the American people. Failure is just not an option…. Keep in mind Republicans have spent the last few years trying to repeal it over 45 times trying to defund it trying to delay it. And so I have not seen a lot of effort on their part to make the law better but simply to destroy it. So that’s the kind of issue that I’m working with Wolf on my committee. I’ve got to make sure that we all work together to make sure that the law works for millions upon millions of Americans who need health care…. I think what I’m seeing now is the same play and the same scene all over again. We saw the chairman make strong allegations which were inaccurate with regard to Benghazi and Fast and Furious and IRS. And only to find out that those allegations were simply not accurate and had no basis of fact. So it makes my job a little tougher.Note that the country has yet to learn the truth of what happened in Benghazi Fast and Furious and the IRS scandal. In every case Cummings has tried to prevent oversight not to facilitate it. He acknowledges some failures in the administration and expresses some minimal outrage but then tries to cast Republicans as witch-hunters rather than trying to hold the executive accountable. Expect more of the same on Obamacare.,1
443,President Barack Obama has illegally suspended the single most important provision of Obamacare the infamous Individual Mandate for some Americans.On Dec. 19 the president declared a change to the Individual Mandate a provision that led to the first lawsuit in American history where a majority of the states in this nation (26 out of 50) sued the federal government over the constitutionality of a federal law resulting in a historic Supreme Court decision that conservative lawyers and scholars roundly condemn insofar as it upheld the Individual Mandate as a massive tax by a 5-4 vote.The Obama administration’s disastrous rollout of Obamacare has been a textbook illustration of the manifest incompetence of government to run the American healthcare system from the humiliating website difficulties to the eye-popping costs of skyrocketing monthly insurance premiums and deductibles. The White House explains that it would be unfair under these circumstances to penalize Americans who attempt to obtain insurance through the Obamacare exchanges but are unable to do so.Therefore the president has declared a “hardship exemption” for Americans encountering those difficulties. There will be a grace period for at least part of 2014. The White House has not specified a firm date of when this exemption will definitely end or how they will be able to distinguish with certainty people who earnestly tried to obtain insurance versus those who are gaming the system.But this exemption like those that came before it is illegal. The language of ACA’s Section 1501 is to impose a truly-mandatory Individual Mandate. Conservatives insist that even if all the provisions in the ACA are applied the system will not work financially. But even liberals admit that if the Individual Mandate is not in force then you do not bring in enough revenue from young healthy adults to pay for the staggering cost of the massive new entitlements and programs that the ACA creates. Without the Individual Mandate you get a “death spiral” of growing deficits that will render health insurance companies insolvent and deprive healthcare providers of payment for their life-saving treatments.In Section 1513 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) the Employer Mandate (the requirement for companies employing 50+ people) specifies that this requirement for employers to offer insurance goes into effect Jan. 1 2014. When Obama announced over the summer that he was suspending that requirement until 2015 he said he has the power to “tweak” a law so long as that tweaking “doesn’t go to the essence of the law.”That’s dead wrong under the U.S. Constitution. Ironically it would not apply here anyway since some of these provisions like the Individual Mandate and the Employer Mandate are two of the most important provisions of the entire ACA and are essential to the ACA’s core operations. However even if they were insignificant provisions the Constitution does not permit a president to change a single semicolon of a federal law by himself.Under Article I of the Constitution every law must either pass the House the Senate and be signed by the president or if the president vetoes the bill instead of signing it then it must pass the House and Senate a second time by a two-thirds super-majority vote in each chamber. That is the only process by which federal law can be made. Everything else is illegal.Many laws authorize top administrative officials to develop regulations carrying the force of law to implement some provision in the law. Other laws contain provisions that empower executive-branch officials to suspend or modify certain legal requirements usually for a fixed period of time and only after certain conditions are met such as completing a study that discovers facts that are relevant to the law’s operations. This power is delegated by the terms of the statute where the federal law-making body–Congress–votes to include such an option in a law.That is not the case with these parts of Obamacare. The changes in the law that President Obama has announced such as telling insurers in Nov. 2013 that they could continue offering canceled policies have been unilateral changes to mandatory terms in the federal law passed by Congress. These are provisions where Congress did not allow Obama or any of his Cabinet secretaries any discretion or options. They are requirements that bind the government and the private sector.So not only is Obamacare bad policy but now another aspect of this program is illegal.Ken Klukowski is senior legal analyst for Breitbart News and represented Members of Congress at the Supreme Court in Obamacare litigation.

444,"And so far you have to admit this Scam has worked beautifully. The White House has been rocked back on their heels not just by the rollout problems of HealthCare.gov (which is now actually working) but also by these Scammy ""Cancellation Letters"". But now the charlatans behind the curtain are finally being revealed.Donna received the letter canceling her insurance plan on Sept. 16. Her insurance company LifeWise of Washington told her that they'd identified a new plan for her. If she did nothing she'd be covered. A 56-year-old Seattle resident with a 57-year-old husband and 15-year-old daughter Donna had been looking forward to the savings that the Affordable Care Act had to offer. But that's not what she found. Instead she'd be paying an additional $300 a month for coverage. The letter made no mention of the health insurance marketplace that would soon open in Washington where she could shop for competitive plans and only an oblique reference to financial help that she might qualify for if she made the effort to call and find out. Otherwise she'd be automatically rolled over to a new plan -- and as the letter said ""If you're happy with this plan do nothing."" If Donna had done nothing she would have ended up spending about $1000 more a month for insurance than she will now that she went to the marketplace picked the best plan for her family and accessed tax credits at the heart of the health care reform law. ""The info that we were sent by LifeWise was totally bogus. Why the heck did they try to screw us?"" Donna said. ""People who are afraid of the ACA should be much more afraid of the insurance companies who will exploit their fear and end up overcharging them."" Donna is not alone.No she's not alone. It's not clear how widespread this practice has been but some State insurance commissioners are starting to notice. In Kentucky Insurance Provider Humana was fined $65000 for sending out misleading letters.The Kentucky Department of Insurance has fined Humana $65430 because it offered policyholders an unapproved opportunity to amend their insurance as part of a letter that regulators have called “misleading.” The department investigated letters sent in August to 6543 individual plan policyholders in Kentucky. The letters said they needed to renew their plans for 2014 within 30 days or choose a more expensive option that complies with the Affordable Care Act. But regulators last month called the letters misleading arguing they did not make sufficiently clear that policyholders could compare and choose competing plans on the state’s health insurance exchanges which open on Oct. 1 and for which they could be eligible for federal subsidies.Let's follow this logically if the letters were sent in August and required a response within 30 days - it essentially forced the policy holders to choose the worse possible option before the Oct 1st launch of their State Exchange. That is a classic ""High Pressure"" sales tactic. ""Buy NOW or you'll miss out. SALE ENDING SOON"" - when in fact there was no legitimate reason to push people make a decision in that 30 day window other than to prevent them from shopping on the Exchange. Read the Human Letter. 2200 people actually did respond within that 30 period but Kentucy regulators after finding they had been deceived by Humana released them from that agreement and allowed them to go ahead and shop for a better plan on the marketplace. Then they fined Humana for their attempted Scam.[Kentucky Insurance Commissioner Sharon] Clark gave the example of a single mother with children who was urged to sign up for a Humana plan with a monthly premium of $719.86. That price is higher than any comparable plan for sale on the state's insurance marketplace Clark said -- not to mention that the mother might have qualified for tax subsidies to help pay for it if she went through the marketplace as Donna did.So the next time you hear or read about how ObamaCare has caused someone to lose their inexpensive plan only to be forced to choose a much more expensive one. Don't Believe It. As Adm. Akbar would say: It's. A. Trap! Vyan8:42 AM PT: To be fair as VcLib pointed out in the comments not every plan was automatically Grandfathered. There were these restrictions via https://www.healthcare.gov/....All health plans must:.End lifetime limits on coverage.End arbitrary cancellations of health coverage.Cover adult children up to age 26.Provide a Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC) a short easy-to-understand summary of what a plan covers and costs.Hold insurance companies accountable to spend your premiums on health care not administrative costs and bonuses Grandfathered plans DON'T have to:.Cover preventive care for free.Guarantee your right to appeal.Protect your choice of doctors and access to emergency care .Be held accountable through Rate Review for excessive premium increases In addition to the above grandfathered individual health insurance plans (the kind you buy yourself not the kind you get from an employer) don't have to: .End yearly limits on coverage .Cover you if you have a pre-existing health conditionSo if you had a plan that had a lifetime cap didn't cover your children until they were 26 could be arbitrarily cancelled and didn't spend 80-85% of your premiums on your care - that plan would have to be updated or replaced. If you had a plan like that and for some reason liked it then you were always going to have to make an adjustment to a plan that doesn't suck anymore. The question is would you be able to shop for the best possible option or would you stay with the options given by your current provider? These letters show that some providers tried to corral their clients into staying and accepting a much higher rate - blaming the ACA for it - and therefore scaring them away from the Exchange Marketplace. We've been hearing that the reason these plans were more expensive is because they had to cover preventive care (Limbaugh had a field-day with that one last week) but as shown above the Grandfathered Plans Didn't. It's a scam it's all a scam.10:13 AM PT: One more issue on Grandfathered Plans via the CommentsPlans could acquire grandfathered status by adding those features to the existing ones they did not have to already have them in place. Some of the elements like the ""no lifetime cap"" one were phased in over time and therefore explicitly allowed adjustment of benefits in an existing plan. Coverage of children under 26 is not likely to be a feature that many plans had in early 2010 yet clearly insurance plans have added this feature. My current coverage has grandfathered status. It had some of these features like no lifetime cap other benefits have been added or modified to comply with the grandfathering requirements.So you got that? Grandfathered Plans are not written in unbendable unbreakable Adamantium they can and have been amended since 2010. They don't have to meet all the requirements of the ACA just a few of them and have to have existed since before the law was passed and signed - That's All.So let's go back and revisit ""If you like your plan you can keep it"" as being flawed or wrong. It's NOT. Instead of amending the plans to meet minimum grandfather requirements they are being Shutdown By the Insurance Industries Choice not by ObamaCare.1:34 PM PT: One final point that puts the LIE to the claim that these plans couldn't meet the Grandfathered requirements is the fact that There's Nothing New Required of Grandfathered Plans This Year.The Lifting of the Lifetime Spending Cap has been phased in since 2010.The law restricts and phases out the annual dollar limits that all job-related plans and individual health insurance plans issued after March 23 2010 can put on most covered health benefits. Specifically the law says that none of these plans can set an annual dollar limit lower than:$750000: for a plan year or policy year starting on or after September 23 2010 but before September 23 2011.$1.25 million: for a plan year or policy year starting on or after September 23 2011 but before September 23 2012.$2 million: for a plan year or policy year starting on or after September 23 2012 but before January 1 2014. No annual dollar limits are allowed on most covered benefits beginning January 1 2014.It's not like the ACA suddenly requires old insurance plans to do something this year that they weren't essentially required to do last year - other than PAY peoples claims.Similarly the ability to keep your children on your family plan isn't new that was established in 2010.ffective for Plan or Policy Years Beginning On or After September 23 2010. Secretary Kathleen Sebelius called on leading insurance companies to begin covering young adults voluntarily before the implementation date required by the Affordable Care Act (which is plan or policy years beginning on or after September 23rd). Early implementation would avoid gaps in coverage for new college graduates and other young adults and save on insurance company administrative costs of dis-enrolling and re-enrolling them between May 2010 and September 23 2010. Over 65 companies have responded to this call saying they will voluntarily continue coverage for young adults who graduate or age off their parents' insurance before the implementation deadline.Lastly the requirement to spend at least 80% of your premiums on care and not administrative costs has already been in effect that's why people have been getting rebate checks.A new provision of the Affordable Care Act — called the Medical Loss Ratio or the “80/20″ provision — could mean some Americans will see a rebate from their health insurance companies tomorrow. The provision is aimed at holding health insurance companies accountable for how they spend the money collected through premiums. It compares the dollars they spend on health care costs vs. other overhead costs — like marketing salaries and administrative expenses.Grandfathered plans don't have to cover pre-existing conditions. Grandfathered plans don't have to provide free preventive care services. (High Co-Pays and Deductibles can remain) Grandfathered plans can still limit yearly coverage (in the individual market).In short there is no New Special Expensive OBAMACARE Requirement on existing Grandfathered plans other the fact that the lifetime cap has gone from $2 Million to Infinite and they can't arbitrarily CANCEL your insurance between renewal periods. They can only do it at the end of you plan year which is exactly what they're doing - simply because they can not because Obamacare put some onerous expensive requirement on them.Just about everything they were required by the ACA to do this year they had to do LAST YEAR and the year before that. Even more than when I first wrote this diary now believe these ""ObamaCare Cancellations"" are a SCAM.",0
445,"Catalina CamiaUSA TODAYSen. Pat Roberts R-Kan. says it's time for Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to resign for ""gross incompetence"" over the rocky start to a centerpiece of President Obama's health care law.It's not unusual for a GOP senator to call on a member of a Democratic Cabinet to resign or vice versa. But when the senator and the Cabinet secretary hail from the same state their families have long been friends and the senator supported the secretary's confirmation that's noteworthy.Sebelius and the Obama administration are taking a lot of blows over the new online health insurance exchanges that launched Oct. 1. Roberts has long been a critic of the health care law and the computer glitches that have marred the rollout of the online exchanges are his last straw.""Everything we warned about has come to pass"" Roberts said in a statement that was especially critical of Sebelius' much-mocked appearance on The Daily Showwith Jon Stewart. ""They can see Obamacare has failed them. We need a secretary who can admit when enough is enough.""Sebelius a former governor of Kansas defended the administration's launch of the health insurance exchanges. People have complained about long delays to sign up or not being able to do so at all because the Healthcare.gov website crashes. ""Nobody wants Americans to have to wait to sign up"" she wrote in an op-ed column for USA TODAY. ""Engineers are working day and night to make upgrades. We're adding more servers to enable the system to handle larger loads. And we're upgrading our software as well to make the system more efficient and enable it to handle higher volumes.""Roberts said at Sebelius' confirmation hearing in 2009 that they enjoyed a ""special relationship.""

446,With this in mind here’s Harry Reid in an interview with a Nevada TV station making the startling and counter-intuitive claim that the health law could actually be a plus for Democrats in the 2014 elections. Asked about the rollout problems and whether they would hurt Dems Reid replied:“This is something that America needed. We cannot have health care just for people with money…I think it’s going to be good for them. By that time there will be a lot of people on it that have already signed up. It’ll be fine…Politics ebbs and flows. This has not been fun the last month or so. But it’s getting better even the last few days.”I don’t know if I’d go as far as Reid here — it seems obvious the law could remain a liability for embattled Democrats; the question is how much that will matter. Indeed the Hill reports that many Senate Dems remain deeply anxious about how the law will play out and what it will mean for their chances.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBut the message Reid is trying to send to fellow Dems is important. The message is: We can’t go back to the old system as Republicans would do and voters instinctually get this. Meanwhile over time as more people sign up and more positive stories emerge the politics of this can only get better and the Republican position will become increasingly untenable.The truth is that whatever nervousness remains among Dems they are mostly shaping their strategy around that premise. This has been true for awhile now — the rollout fiasco obscured it temporarily but didn’t meaningfully change much — and the coverage is beginning to catch up with this basic reality.For Democrats turning around the D.C. media narrative on the health law is important. It would make it less likely that Dems get skittish again if there are more problems with the law in 2014 which is likely. It would also help maintain a sense of unity that would work in Dems’ favor particularly now that there are some scattered signs of Republicans breaking away from the party’s repeal position.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement* MEDIA NOTES DEMS GOING ON OFFENSE ON OBAMACARE: The New York Times has a big piece spelling out all the ways Dems will be pressing the case for the law’s benefits in the days ahead. It’s moving forward on all fronts:The president’s aides said that with fixes in place online they hoped a daily barrage of more positive messages about the health care law during the next several weeks — some to be delivered by Mr. Obama personally — would help refocus attention on its benefits….House Democrats have begun passing along positive stories in their districts — of constituents obtaining insurance for the first time and gaining access to preventive care — during coordinated morning speeches that have become dueling anecdotes from the health care wars. On Thursday members will focus on pre-existing conditions; next week the theme is Medicaid expansion.This was always in the works and it was always going to happen; it was simply put on hold by the failure of the website. I’d add that this also includes Dems making the Medicaid expansion an issue against multiple GOP governors.Of course it’s also true that there will probably be more problems with the law. If that happens you’ll see Dems redouble efforts to drive home the consequences of repeal to offset those downsides.* REPUBLICANS STRUGGLING WITH REPEAL MESSAGE: In the above Times story this from a Virginia Republican is key:Story continues below advertisementEven some Republicans are grudgingly saying that the health care law is already too established for a wholesale repeal and with thousands of uninsured signing up daily that option grows more distant each week. “It’s not in dispute that many Americans’ lives are being disrupted in an important way by this law” said Representative Scott Rigell Republican of Virginia. “Is it also true that some Americans’ lives have gotten better? Yes and to not acknowledge that is to deny reality.” The health care law he said needs “more of a course change than a course reversal.”You will be seeing more of this. Readers along these lines please tell me what you’re seeing from lawmakers in your states and districts.Advertisement* OBAMACARE WEBSITE REPORTEDLY SHOWING IMPROVEMENTS: CBS News has a good segment reporting that people’s experiences with the website are picking up and enrollment is surging. The more stories like this you see the more inclined Dems will be to hold the line.* WHY DEMS ARE MAKING A BIG ISSUE OUT OF INEQUALITY: E.J. Dionne has an excellent column analyzing Obama’s big inequality speech yesterday with this key insight:Republicans are betting that Obamacare and its travails will be the deciding issue in next year’s elections. Obama thinks he can make the system work well enough to ease its burdens on vulnerable Democratic candidates. But he also thinks health care and the minimum wage can be linked to other proposals in a larger battle for economic fairness. The broader the playing field the better his chances.Yep. There’s precedent for this: Obama and his advisers returned to these big themes to reboot his presidency and launch his reelection campaign during the low point in 2011.Story continues below advertisement* ECONOMY PICKING UP MOMENTUM? Reuters:The U.S. economy grew faster than initially estimated in the third quarter as businesses aggressively accumulated stock but underlying domestic demand remained sluggish. Gross domestic product grew at a 3.6 percent annual rate instead of the 2.8 percent pace reported earlier the Commerce Department said on Thursday.A long long way to go however and there are no signs that Congress will lift self-imposed austerity anytime soon even though “demand remained sluggish.”* BUDGET DEAL TAKING SHAPE: MSNBC’s Daily Rundown has the first figure I’ve seen on spending levels for the emerging short-term budget deal:AdvertisementThe deal that’s taking shape sets the top line number in the $990 billion range by seeking alternative cuts and raising revenuesThe new revenues would almost certainly come from fees and not closing loopholes while the cuts will probably not fall on entitlements. Which is to say: All the tough decisions are being deferred. Also: That’s a higher spending level then the sequester; it’ll be interesting to see how conservatives react.* AND GOP LEADERS SCHOOLING REPUBLICANS ON TALKING TO WOMEN: Politico scoops:The National Republican Congressional Committee wants to make sure there are no Todd Akin-style gaffes next year so they’re meeting with top aides to sitting Republicans to teach them what to say — or not to say — on the trail especially when their boss is running against a woman. Speaker John Boehner is serious too. His own top aides met recently with Republican staff to discuss how lawmakers should talk to women constituents.,1
447,Apparently the media is growing tired of the White House selectively releasing ObamaCare data that gets to the heart of nothing but makes the program look like it is much more popular than it likely is. For instance today the White House informed the media that between Sunday and Friday Healthcare.gov enjoyed 3.7 million visits.We have also been told that the site’s error rate was .077 percent the response time averaged under a second and a whopping (and improbable) 93% of consumers did come back later after they were asked to due to the site being too busy.As The Hill points out though that data is all hollow happy talk that tells us nothing about what really matters. What the White House refuses to disclose or claims it doesn’t yet have the data to disclose just happens to be the information that will tell us if ObamaCare is or is not working:The Obama administration is selectively releasing data and metrics on ObamaCare to bolster its case that the rollout is going better in the month of December.Tidbits of information from federal health officials — especially figures that show improvements at HealthCare.gov — have become a key tool in the effort to “reboot” the law in the eyes of the public.But the limited nature of the releases has created conflict with the media and put the spotlight on outstanding areas of concern for the rollout such as the enrollment site’s back end.The White House has blithely changed the definition of the world “enrollee” to someone who has not yet enrolled but has only selected an insurance plan and placed it into a shopping cart. Studies show that the abandonment rate for shopping carts is 67%.Up until now though the media have breathlessly reported “enrollment” numbers spoon-fed to them by the White House without doing any of their own independent reporting to find out how many have actually enrolled. Maybe those days are coming to an end.The Hill points out the other vital metrics the White House has thus far not released:Since late October federal health officials have touted traffic to the site error rates and page load times almost daily in an effort to illustrate positive changes.Enrollment figures are only discussed monthly and leaked sign-up numbers are not confirmed. Vital information for judging the growing risk pools such as applicants’ ages goes undiscussed.The administration appears to have largely chosen data over anecdotes as the most powerful way to communicate site improvements to the media.The metrics released are difficult to independently verify but provide easy headlines and talking points for anxious supporters of the Affordable Care Act including congressional Democrats.Another area where the White House has dissembled rather than been forthcoming involves the number of meetings between Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and President Obama during the three years after the passage of ObamaCare. A Government Accountability Institute study finds only a single meeting between the two recorded on any White House calendar or log. Friday Jay Carney would only say that the two met frequently but provided no details.While we are sure to be hit with all kinds of selective data leaks before the end of the year that are only meant to make ObamaCare look successful The Hill reports that a number that will not be released until the end of the year is a breakdown of those who are truly enrolled — in other words those who have actually paid for a premium.The fact that the White House always has positive data that sounds good but means nothing but never the data that matters has raised the suspicions of the American people from the beginning. It is good to know now that after two-plus months of this Administration Hustle the media has apparently had enough.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC,1
448,During Thursday’s congressional hearing Rep. Joe Barton (R-TX) tore into the ObamaCare contractors for a hidden line of source code that secretly surrenders the ObamaCare applicant’s right to privacy. It was yet another damning revelation about the snoopiest White House ever and by Friday CNN’s Carol Costello was in full attack mode using misinformation to push back for the Administration.Costello invited Barton on her Friday morning show and after Barton reiterated his concern over ObamaCare’s secret and deceptive disclaimer Costello dug in:Well I’ve been wondering about that. The only health-related question the website asks of you is whether you smoke. It doesn’t ask any other question. So what specifically are you talking about? What specific information would you share on this website that you wouldn’t normally share?Before we get to Barton’s very specific answer I have to interrupt to point out how stunningly ignorant Costello’s question is. First off even if she was correct about the smoking question being the only health-related question it is still a health-related question and therefore a violation of HIPAA. Secondly my understanding of HIPAA is that it not only protects your medical information but also your personal information. And as someone who actually has gone through the ObamaCare application process I can testify (and did here in detail) that the site asks a number of personal questions I “wouldn’t normally share.”Regardless why is this secret disclaimer not a big deal to a supposed journalist? We are talking about the federal government slipping in a line of code that will sucker millions into surrendering their privacy rights altogether not just what qualifies under HIPAA.But Costello is stuck on her White House talking points that claim HIPAA only covers medical information and the smoking question is no big deal.Well watch what happens next: Barton lists three more medical-related questions the ObamaCare website asks: your current insurance plan and its policy number your mental and physical condition and whether or not you are pregnant.And what is Costello’s response? Does she say “Oh I didn’t know that. If you are correct that is a problem.”Nope. She just babbles on with her talking points as though she didn’t hear Barton answer her question with damning specifics:——The most trusted name in news folks.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC,1
449,"Melanie EversleyUSA TODAYUp to 75%25 of those with individual insurance could have policies canceled%2C experts sayAdministration has said a certain percentage of individuals will lose existing policiesLaw sets minimum standards for policiesMillions of Americans are getting their health insurance canceled under the Affordable Care Act and the Obama administration has known for about three years that this would happen NBC News is reporting.About 50% to 75% of 14 million consumers who buy health insurance individually will receive a ""cancellation"" letter or its equivalent in the next year because their current policies don't meet the standards laid out by the new law the news organization reports citing four sources deeply involved in ACA.Of those who will be forced to buy new insurance many will face huge price increases NBC reports.Initially the administration stipulated that policies in effect as of March 23 2010 could be ""grandfathered"" or kept even if they don't meet the requirements of the new law. Later the Department of Health and Human Services wrote regulations that narrowed that provision to dictate that if any part of those policies such as co-pay or benefits had substantially changed since then they would not longer be grandfathered in.NBC alleges the administration knew that up to 67% of customers on the individual market could have their policies canceled but instead President Obama said as recently as in 2012 ""If (you) already have health insurance you will keep your health insurance.""The White House told NBC that people whose policies will be canceled will in most cases be automatically shifted to plans with better protections.""Nothing in the Affordable Care Act forces people out of their health plans"" White House spokeswoman Jessica Santillo told the news organization.White House spokesman Jay Carney acknowledged that some plans would not meet the new minimum standards and would ""not qualify for the Affordable Care Act.""",1
450,"7 years agoWashington (CNN) – The No. 3 House Democrat on Sunday blamed a culture of sound bites for President Barack Obama's reneged promise that Americans would be able to keep their existing health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act.""And this is a sound bite that the President probably needed to take some more time to explain to the American people"" Rep. James Clyburn D-South Carolina said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union with Candy Crowley.""[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']After millions of people received cancellation notices for their health plans Obama faced considerable pushback over his promise to Americans that the new health care reform would not affect those who are already happy with their insurance policies.""If you like your health insurance you can keep it"" Obama repeatedly told Americans when selling his signature piece of legislation.After that turned out not to be the case Obama on Thursday announced his administration would allow insurance companies to extend those canceled policies for a year.Clyburn the House assistant Democratic leader said Obama relied too heavily on a sound bite-friendly selling point rather than spelling out that he was only referring to plans in place before the Affordable Care Act became law in 2010 and hadn't changed since.Fact Check: If you liked your health plan you can keep your health plan""One of the things in Washington that I dislike more than anything else is when people say to me 'If you're explaining it you're losing it.' I don't like that at all. I really believe the American people are deserving of explanations"" he said also blaming the media for not fully explaining the new legislation.With recent polls showing the President is considered less trustworthy than in the past Obama on Thursday said he expects he'll need to regain Americans' faith after the rocky rollout of HealthCare.gov and his broken promise about existing plans.Clyburn said he was confident Obama can do so.""Paradise lost paradise regained. When you lose something you can find it again"" he said. ""The President admitted that he expects to be held responsible for regaining the Americans' trust and I think he will.""Watch State of the Union with Candy Crowley Sundays at 9am ET.

451,Dozens of times (that we know of) over his campaign to pass ObamaCare and to win re-election President Obama lied to the American people about being able to keep the health insurance they like. But that lie has only been replaced with another: the lie that these cancellations will be limited to the 5% of Americans in the individual marketplace — when the truth is that these cancellations have only just begun.Over at National Review in a piece appropriately titled “Lying About Lies” Michael Tanner reports that the same ObamaCare formula currently wiping out the individual market is about to rain hell on the employer-based market. The result will be that tens of millions of policies will be wiped out.This is a secret that is and always has been hiding in plain sight.As far back as last March the media dutifully reported that the CBO reported that these cancellations were coming. So the media knew Obama was lying during the campaign but never said a word to spread this truth — oh except to call Mitt Romney a liar for telling the truth.All these Democrats and members of the elite media now pretending they don’t or didn’t know… Please.Just as the media knew Obama was lying about people in the individual market being able to keep their insurance the media also know that the same apocalypse looms for the employer-based market. It is not conservatives making this estimate it is the Congressional Budget Office. [emphasis mine]But the same conditions that are causing the cancellation of individual policies will eventually result in the cancellation of millions of employment-based policies as well. The only reason that hasn’t happened yet is that the employer mandate was postponed for a year so employer plans don’t yet have to be ACA-compliant. But they will. Even the Congressional Budget Office estimates that as many as 20 million workers will lose their current employer-sponsored plans. Combine that with those losing individual plans and more than 30 million Americans cannot keep their current insurance.ObamaCare’s latest trick is the “junk plan hustle.” Over and over we keep hearing about how our White House overlords are doing Americans a favor by canceling the insurance they like and replacing it with “appropriate” health plans. But most of those plans are not junk plans. That is just another lie the White House is telling and the media are letting them get away with it.The media know the White House is lying about this junk plan nonsense because the ObamaCare guidelines for what isn’t a “junk plan” only includes 2% of the policies currently in existence.According to HealthPocket a health-insurance consulting firm fewer than 2 percent of individual plans on offer today meet all ACA requirements. The most frequent reason for noncompliance was not a failure to cover hospitalization as the administration has suggested but not providing pediatric care including vision and dental care for children. A worthwhile benefit perhaps but if you are childless it’s hard to see how lacking such a benefit makes your policy subpar.This is why other serious think tanks believe that before this nightmare is over up to 93 million people could lose the insurance Obama promised they could keep.In order to buy time Obama Democrats and the media are trying to con the American people into believing that the rolling ObamaCare catastrophe is compartmentalized to just 5% of the population. This conspiracy of silence is all about trying to contain through a lie of omission what is a legitimate reason for the public to panic as soon as they realize that … they are next.Obama is not sorry for lying. And the media are not sorry for covering up that lie for three years.The phase we are in now is nothing more than a 2.0 version of that exact same lie.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC,1
452,Before noon Monday 375000 Americans logged on to HealthCare.gov and discovered that though the federal website is working far better than at its launch in October it still runs into problems when demand gets too high. That is both the good news and the bad news for Republicans who are hoping to use Obamacare as their prime attack point in the 2014 congressional elections.For the GOP continuing glitches in the online delivery system for the new national healthcare market reinforce the argument that the Obama administration has tried to do too much too fast without really understanding the enormity of the job. That is the upside for Republicans. The downside is that there is obviously a demand for the product Obamacare is trying to deliver and by the time the election rolls around millions of voters may have forgotten the website bugs. Instead they may be pleased that healthcare coverage is no longer out of reach for them and they will not want to see it taken away by a Republican Congress.Conversely there are a large number of voters who are not especially happy with the healthcare reforms. Many people who buy their own health insurance have been told their old policies are being discontinued and they must buy a more expensive alternative. Others have found their new insurance does not allow them to continue with the same medical care provider. They are upset now; will they still be angry next November?My friend Mark might be. He is one of those who is seeing his healthcare rates spike. Mark got a letter from his insurance company a few weeks ago stating that because of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act the cost of his coverage would almost triple. He went online to look for a better deal in the marketplace but could not find a plan that offered any savings. Then a few days ago his insurance company sent another letter announcing they had miscalculated; his rate was still going up but not by nearly as much.AdvertisementMark’s conclusion fair or not echoes the suspicion many people have: The insurance companies are using Obamacare as an excuse to jack up rates and increase their profits.On the other side of the ledger there’s a young man I know named Daniel. He is a college student too old to be on his parents’ plan too lacking in income to buy his own coverage -- until now. Sunday Dan signed up online. It took him just 45 minutes (he could have done it in under a half hour if he had not needed to track down an elusive number connected to his student loans). Lucky for him he is in a state with a smoothly operating exchange. Even luckier he now has healthcare coverage and because of his income level does not have to pay a cent.The rough reality is that people like Mark are paying more so that people like Daniel can get the healthcare they could not afford before Obamacare kicked in. Plenty of folks especially Republicans would insist this is not fair. But consider what the alternative has been.A couple of years ago Daniel suffered an appendicitis attack. Fortunately he was rushed to a hospital and got immediate expert care. He also got a bill for $30000 that he could not pay. So as hospitals have done for many years when giving care to those who could not afford insurance they waived the huge fee and recouped the loss by billing other patients and their insurance companies at excessive rates.AdvertisementWill that change now that nearly everyone will be insured? Will costs come down and benefit everyone? Will the complexities of the new healthcare system continue to be a source of glitches goof ups and aggravation or will it all smooth out over time? Will Americans understand that those of us who are healthy and better off financially have always subsidized the cost of caring for those who are ill and poor and that this new system is an attempt to rationalize that process?Since those questions and many more have yet to be answered no one can really say if Republicans will be able to ride the anti-Obamacare bandwagon to victory next fall. By betting against universal healthcare they might just as easily prove to be big losers.,1
453,The federal Obamacare exchange website went down again for several hours on Friday leaving consumers unable to sign up just days before the deadline to obtain coverage by Jan. 1.In the early afternoon many visitors were greeted with a message saying the site had a lot of visitors and asked people to wait. By about 2 pm the site appeared to be operating normally and users were directed to log in or create an account.Earlier in the day applicants to healthcare.gov found a message saying that the system was down for scheduled maintenance. Visitors were advised to try again later or enter their email address to receive notice when the site is working again.The exchange's tech team encountered an error during routine maintenance on Thursday night said Joanne Peters a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services. Repairs began at 10 a.m. Friday and were estimated to take two to three hours.The outage came shortly before President Obama was set to hold a news conference before leaving for vacation.And it came at a very inopportune time for the rollout of Obamacare. Americans in the states using the federal exchange have until the end of Monday to pick a plan on healthcare.gov to be eligible for coverage beginning Jan. 1.The administration has said that those who encounter problems signing up can qualify for a special enrollment period but it has not provided details on how it would work.As 2013 draws to a close administration officials are scrambling to smooth over remaining Obamacare problems.Late Thursday the White House announced that individual policy holders who received termination notices could qualify for a hardship exemption and buy catastrophic plans on the exchanges. And after pressure from the administration insurers announced applicants could pay their first month's premiums as late as Jan. 10 and receive coverage retroactive to Jan. 1.--CNN's Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.,1
454,CGI Federal the company responsible for building the problem-plagued Web site for the Affordable Care Act won the job because of what federal officials deemed a “technically superior” proposal according to government documents and people familiar with the decision.Not considered in the 2011 selection process was the history of numerous executives at CGI Federal who had come from another company that had mishandled at least 20 other government ­information technology projects more than a decade ago. But federal officials were not required to examine that long-term track record which included a highly publicized failure to automate retirement benefits for millions of federal workers.By 2011 CGI Federal already had been cleared to do government work at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) the agency overseeing the rollout of the new health-care law.The company had been included in a pool of pre-screened approved contractors in 2007 during the George W. Bush administration and only firms in that pool were later allowed to bid for the Affordable Care Act work. It was at that earlier time that the problems at American Management Systems the Fairfax County IT contractor acquired by CGI would have figured into the assessment of CGI Federal contracting experts say.In hindsight one former CMS official said the AMS record “could well have knocked [CGI Federal] out of the competition and probably should have.”View Graphic A look at the consumer's route through the HealthCare.gov website and the potential failure points.In light of the bungled launch of the health-care Web site critics have repeatedly asked how CGI Federal got the contract and there has been widespread speculation on online news sites and blogs that the firm was selected because of political ties to the Obama administration.But a review of internal documents and interviews with former and current federal officials show that the selection process was walled off from politics.Career officials at CMS working out of an obscure Baltimore-based contracting office focused in 2011 on the proposals submitted by four bidders examining technical competency and cost while giving relatively little attention to past performance. Since 2007 CGI Federal had won 17 other CMS jobs under the pre-screened contract worth several hundred million dollars.The review of CGI Federal concluded there was “no evidence of performance risk” according to a CMS document portions of which were read to The Washington Post by a person familiar with the contracting process.CGI Federal won the $93 million contract now worth $293 million in September 2011.At the time of the earlier selection process in 2007 CGI Federal was still relatively new to federal contracting. It had grown out of CGI Group’s acquisition in 2004 of AMS which had a recent history of troubled projects including a Philadelphia school computer system that sent paychecks to dead people and a Mississippi tax system so dysfunctional that a jury awarded a $474 million verdict against the firm.Three former CMS officials said in recent interviews that the AMS problems should have raised red flags.“Should CMS have recognized that ‘Okay here’s CGI Federal. It’s a new company but oh my God it looks a lot like the AMS from yesterday’?” asked one former CMS official familiar with the contracting process who like others interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal procedures. “Yes. I would consider that dropping the ball.’’Tasha Bradley a CMS spokeswoman said in a statement that the agency “adheres by a long-established contracting process where expert career contracting officials evaluate and award contracts based on criteria outlined in the contract solicitation including past performance technical expertise and proposed contract value.”CMS declined to comment on specific questions about how closely CGI Federal’s past performance was evaluated and whether that review looked at AMS.Former AMS executives have defended that company’s performance and CGI officials have rejected any comparison with AMS’s earlier failures.CGI Federal has also defended its work on HealthCare.gov despite an October launch that White House officials have acknowledged was disastrous. Federal officials have faulted the company’s performance saying it missed deadlines understaffed the job and overstated its progress.People familiar with the project have said it was also hampered by administration mismanagement fierce Republican opposition and political sensitivities that delayed policy and regulatory decisions.The federal online marketplace that is selling health plans in 36 states under the 2010 health-care law has been functioning better in recent weeks but officials are still working to fix lingering problems including errors in enrollment records sent to insurance companies. CGI Federal remains intimately involved in the project writing computer code in attempts to fix various aspects of the system.Linda Odorisio CGI’s vice president for global communications said the company “continues to work closely with CMS and all of its vendor partners to deliver continuous enhancements in system performance and the user experience” on the Web site.She added that CGI Federal “contributed to the significant improvements made to the system over the last two months resulting in more than half a million Americans enrolling in just the first three weeks of December.”Umbrella contractIn December 2006 CMS put out a request for proposals. The agency said it was seeking “world-class IT services” to improve and maintain the massive systems that run Medicare and Medicaid according to contracting documents. Thirty-one bidders responded including CGI Federal.CMS used a procurement method that has become increasingly common over the past decade. The agency first awarded an umbrella contract to a group of firms and those firms were then eligible to bid on future IT work. Experts say this saves the government time because it shortens the subsequent bid process.In evaluating the bids CMS was to scrutinize each company’s performance on previous contracts according to an internal agency document obtained by The Post. The document described a “risk assessment” of cost control on-time delivery and other factors.Federal law requires that past performance be considered for all federal contracts worth more than $150000 with limited exceptions. Federal regulations also say CMS should have considered the record of “predecessor companies” such as AMS. Several former officials familiar with the 2007 selection said no concerns about CGI Federal were raised inside the agency.AMS projects had run into trouble at the federal level and in at least 12 states according to government audit reports interviews and news accounts. The purchase of AMS was CGI’s entree into the U.S. government market and AMS executives flocked to CGI Federal. Today more than 100 former AMS employees are senior executives or consultants working for CGI in the Washington area.One former CMS official said the agency especially should have examined the most publicized AMS failure an effort to automate retirement benefits for millions of federal workers. AMS was fired in 2001 by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board after going $60 million over budget writing computer code that turned out to be useless and never delivering a workable system according to government reports.AMS had settled lawsuits arising from the project in 2003. “That should have stood out’’ the former official said.CGI Federal was ultimately chosen for an umbrella contract worth up to $4 billion in future work along with 15 other firms including Lockheed Martin and IBM.While it is unclear whether agency officials examined the AMS track record former CMS officials said it probably would not have made much difference because past performance has long been an overlooked component of federal contracting.Deadline pressureIn the summer of 2011 the Obama administration was racing to figure out who would build the Affordable Care Act’s all-important Web site. “Time is of the essence” said an internal CMS draft request for proposals dated June 24 2011.With deadlines looming officials limited the bidders to the winners of the 2007 umbrella contract. “There was very great time pressure” recalled a former CMS official familiar with the process. “The feeling was we had a lot of big IT powerhouses and they knew our work.’’Four firms applied: IBM Computer Sciences Corp. Quality Software Services and CGI Federal.As is tradition the selection process was strictly sheltered from political considerations and political appointees at CMS or elsewhere in the administration according to numerous former and current CMS employees.“I deliberately stayed out of contracting’’ said Leslie Norwalk the agency’s acting administrator under President George W. Bush. “If that had changed I would have heard rumblings.’’Agency documents show that a career contracting officer in the CMS Office of Acquisition and Grants Management was in charge of awarding the contract for the Web site. The selection process focused on bidders’ business and technical proposals which described the proposed cost hardware and software required proposed infrastructure design security requirements and key personnel.The companies’ past performance was not a priority. The CMS document listed it as the second least important of seven technical evaluation factors. And the review would look only at past work under the 2007 umbrella contract the document said.While the review found no performance risk for CGI Federal agency officials had not always been satisfied with the company’s work. In 2010 CMS rejected CGI Federal’s bid under the umbrella contract to perform work on four health IT systems in part citing unspecified performance issues in carrying out an earlier contract according to a Government Accountability Office ruling. CGI Federal protested the CMS decision but the GAO upheld it.And the review did not take into account problems that several other CGI projects had encountered including years of delay and system failures on a state computer system in Hawaii. State auditors in 2010 partially faulted another CGI subsidiary CGI Technologies and Solutions for those issues.CGI says its overall work is high-quality and nearly always on time and on budget and the company has also had many successes. In the past two years CGI Federal has been awarded contracts with at least 25 federal agencies.Documents and interviews show that CGI Federal was selected because of what was deemed to be the company’s technical prowess even though the price of the firm’s proposal was higher than that of at least of one competitor.,1
455,WASHINGTON - -Just six enrollments occurred on the opening day for www.healthcare.gov the troubled Obamacare website according to documents released late Thursday by a House oversight committee.Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Vista) chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee obtained the tally from meeting notes compiled by officials inside the “war room” at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services which was overseeing the rollout of the insurance marketplace.The White House has declined to say how many people have signed up in the new health insurance marketplace and Kathleen Sebelius the Department of Health and Human Services secretary testified this week that her department has not been able to collect accurate data.Department spokeswoman Joanne Peters said late Thursday that the documents released by the committee “appear to be notes. They do not include official enrollment statistics.”AdvertisementPHOTOS: 2013’s memorable political momentsThe department plans to release enrollment statistics “on a monthly basis” once reliable information is available Peters said. “We are focused on providing reliable and accurate information and we do not have that at this time.... We have always anticipated that the pace of enrollment will increase throughout the enrollment period” she said.Issa’s committee obtained the documents after requesting them from the contractors developing the website for the administration. The committee subpoenaed Sebelius on Thursday for additional documents including those related to attempted and completed enrollments.The administration said Thursday that dozens of computer engineers from top technology firms have been brought in as part of its “tech surge” to help fix the problems with the site.The website where Americans can shop for health insurance is central to the new healthcare law which mandates that all individuals carry policies by March 2014 or face a penalty. Since the site’s troubles became clear officials have also noted that insurance can be sought over the phone or in person at facilities helping to usher in the program.AdvertisementAccording to the notes obtained by Issa’s committee six enrollments happened on Oct. 1. On the next day there were 248. Officials hope to enroll 7 million people for coverage next year.PHOTOS: The battle over ObamacareObama stood behind his signature law this week reminding Americans of the benefits including provisions that prohibit companies from denying coverage for people with preexisting medical conditions.In a congressional hearing on Wednesday Sebelius apologized for botched debut taking responsibility as the administration scrambles to get the site running properly. The administration has promised to have the site running smoothly by the end of the month.Lisa.Mascaro@latimes.comAdvertisementTwitter:@LisaMascaroinDC,1
456,"Story highlights Two-month race to fix HealthCare.gov site hits major deadline Saturday ""War room"" mentality takes over as contractors work with administration ""Ruthless prioritization"" to get site working quickly may have a consequence(CNN) —Saturday marks the Obama administration’s self-imposed deadline to fix the troubled HealthCare.gov website for most people at least.Deadline Day: Will Obamacare website work?It caps a frenzied two-month race by computer programmers and contractors sprinkled throughout the D.C. suburbs on both sides of the beltway in Maryland and Virginia.The overall scene in response to the botched rollout of the online portal conveys a “war-room” urgency with “ruthless prioritization” many moving parts grinding work briefings phone-bridges and of course plenty of take-out food.Operations are overseen from a command center in Columbia Maryland. That’s where contractor QSSI has spearheaded the effort with help from some Web heavyweights.John Engates the Chief Technology Officer at Rackspace.com was an early critic of the website given a behind-the-scenes tour of the effort to fix it.“I think it’s going to work” Engates said on CNN’s “The Lead.”But Luke Chung president of Virginia-based software developer FMS Inc. called the administration’s prediction the site would work at 80% capacity on or around November 30 an impractical threshold in the software world.The site which was taken down for overnight maintenance ahead of Saturday’s deadline is the lynchpin of Obamacare and is meant to be used by 36 states to enroll millions of Americans into health insurance now required by federal law.Fourteen states have their own exchange sites and those by and large have fared better than HealthCare.gov which was marred by crashes and other problems upon its launch October 1 embarrassing President Barack Obama who championed the law known as Obamacare.What happened in October?The first thing to figure out was what went wrong – in brief.“Not all websites are created equal” Steven Van Roekel the nation’s chief information officer and a former personal assistant to Bill Gates who helped roll out Windows XP told reporters on Tuesday at a White House briefing.Unlike a site like CNN.com which he said is only to be viewed or even an e-commerce site which takes orders HealthCare.gov is meant to be seamlessly multi-faceted.A single user’s experience unbeknownst to them could require real-time information from the social security administration DHS the IRS and Veterans Affairs.Fixing it on Obama’s orders was ultimately left to Jeffrey Zients the management consultant and entrepreneur and former and future White House official.He assembled a team which includes Van Roekel and other experts to oversee the overhaul being done by QSSI other contractors and programmers.High intensity approachZients conducted Tuesday’s White House briefing for reporters at a clipped pace and with the no nonsense tone of a tour guide in a hurry.The session included a teleconference with the team from QSSI in Maryland – they couldn’t spare the time to make the trip into Washington – and programmers who drove into town from Tyson’s Corner in Virginia where most of the software work is being done.Seeking to confound the public view of the site as an epic failure of Presidential management Zients and the contractors described a hive of trouble-shooters huddled at twice-daily conference calls and on a round-the-clock open phone line to respond as quickly as possible to problems.“The point of these calls is we don’t have an hour or a minute to waste and therefore we need to make sure that there is ruthless prioritization at all times as to what matters most that there’s real-time reaction if something unexpected happened someone hit a roadblock on a fix – so what are we going to do about that bug and how are we going to address that bug and you get the best minds on the problems right away” said Zients.At a satellite office of QSSI in Virginia insiders described to CNN’s Brianna Keilar a scene of programmers in marathon code-writing sessions and surrounded by stale Chinese food and half-eaten pizzas.Back-end concernOne result of Zients’ prioritization? A focus over the past two months on the experience for users who want to sign up for insurance. That approach could have a consequence.Insurers have reported receiving duplicative and at times faulty information on the back end of the site which raises questions about whether some people who think they’re signing up for insurance will actually have it on January 1.Insurers: Site glitches persistIndeed much of the system supporting HealthCare.gov - the back end for making payments and interacting with insurance companies – still needs to be built.But so far it has been the difficulty for Americans trying to sign up for coverage in the first place that has partly damaged public perception of the law.Obamacare site fix: 5 things to look forSo the programmers and the contractors pay constant attention to real-time site metrics provided by services like Chartbeat which is used to measure exactly how many people are on the site at any given time.A quickly flashed screen grab during the technical briefing at the White House showed there were 15687 users on HealthCare.gov at one point. The aim is to have the site capable of hosting 50000 at any given time and up to 800000 per day.That was the goal for the site back on October 1 when repeated crashes seemed to keep most everyone trying to access the site from viewing insurance options.After hardware upgrades installed November 23 and 24 to improve capacity and after software programmers spent the past two months addressing other hiccups supporters of the law hope the website will function as intended.Awash in metricsThey are awash in detailed metrics at the Maryland command center. In addition to Chartbeat another web-based program measures response times; a spike on the graph can indicate serious problems. A third measures how far each and every user makes it through the enrollment process.Don’t look for any of that data after the deadline this weekend however. Specifics are still closely guarded details.“We will continue to update you on metrics and user experience and our success rates as we go forward” said Zients.CNN/ORC Poll: Are Obamacare’s flaws fixable?Boehner signs up for ObamacareGOP Obamacare playbook: Spread negative perceptionSite’s Anonymous Shopper shelved",1
457,November 8 2013The Honorable Darrell E. IssaChairmanCommittee on Oversight and Government ReformU.S. House of RepresentativesWashington D.C. 20515Dear Mr. Chairman:Yesterday you went on national television and made extremely serious allegations against U.S. Chief Technology Officer Todd Park and White House Press Secretary Jay Carney essentially accusing them of lying to the American people about the Healthcare.gov website. You then used these alleged falsehoods to justify your threat to subpoena Mr. Park to force him to appear before the Committee next week to answer your allegations. Based on information obtained by the Committee a full week ago however it appears that your attacks against Mr. Park and Mr. Carney are unfounded and that your statements yesterday either misunderstood or mischaracterized the information the Committee obtained. In either case I believe it is important to correct the public record and I request that you apologize to these officials for the unsubstantiated accusations against them.Unfounded Accusations Against Mr. Park and Mr. CarneyYesterday you launched a public attack against Mr. Park and Mr. Carney accusing them of intentionally making false statements about the number of users that were anticipated for the Healthcare.gov website.You issued a press release with the highly inflammatory and misleading headline “ACA Testing Bulletin: HealthCare.gov Could Only Handle 1100 Users Day Before Launch.”[1] As evidence for your claim you released a single document prepared by Quality Software Services Inc. that “lists the testing status and results for various parts of the Federally Facilitated Marketplace (FFM).” You quoted from this document the following statement about a “stress test” conducted on only one testing environment:Ran performance testing overnight in IMP1B environment. Working with CGI to tune the FFM environment to be able to handle maximum load. Currently we are able to reach 1100 users before response time gets too high. CGI is making changes to configuration.[2]Based on this text you jumped to the conclusion that the day before the website launch the full system was able to handle only 1100 users and your allegation was repeated by multiple press outlets.[3] You then argued that this document contradicts previous statements by Mr. Park and Mr. Carney. For example you cited a statement made by Mr. Park on October 6 2013 in which he explained that officials planned for HealthCare.gov to draw approximately 60000 simultaneous users.After issuing your press release you went on national television and accused Mr. Park and Mr. Carney of misleading the American people. During an interview with Fox News you made the following accusations:Jay Carney is paid to say things that aren’t so. But in this case Todd Park and other people who knew the facts who had to know the facts. And the facts were from documents we received from lead contractors that they slowed down to an unacceptable level at 1100 users. Well in fact Todd Park was telling us that at 60000 was the target and at 250000 they just couldn’t handle it. The truth was their goal wasn’t according to documents wasn’t even 60000. Their goal was 10000. They reached 1100.[4]You then used these alleged falsehoods to demand that Mr. Park appear before the Committee at a hearing next Wednesday to answer your accusations. During the same Fox interview you attempted to justify your demand by stating:We’re going to have Todd Park and a number of other political appointees who were part of this pattern of interference and false statements related to this site. And we are going to try to get to the bottom of why politics went ahead of best practices and good technology. Something the American people expect that didn’t happen in this case. And it’s the tip of iceberg that we’re worried about is if they are willing to put politics into a website what will they put into your health care?[5]You also sent a letter to Mr. Park warning that you would issue a subpoena compelling his presence if he does not submit to your demand voluntarily.[6] Your letter completely ignored a previous offer for Mr. Park to brief the Committee in the next several weeks and testify in early December so he would not be pulled away from his current work on improving the Healthcare.gov website during this critical time.[7]Information Obtained by the Committee Contradicts AccusationsBased on information obtained by the Committee it appears that you fundamentally misunderstood or mischaracterized the document you released to the press yesterday and that your accusations against Mr. Park and Mr. Carney are wholly unfounded. You appear to be conflating the results of a much smaller testing environment with final production testing of the system at full capacity. As the document you released states the 1100 user figure was conducted for the “IMP1B environment” a testing environment that was only a sample size rather than the full FFM production environment.The estimates for the full FFM website environment were considerably higher. We know this from the transcribed interview of Henry Chao the Deputy Chief Information Officer at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services which Committee staff conducted on November 1 2013. During his interview Mr. Chao explained—in response to detailed questioning from your staff—that officials estimated that up to 58000 virtual users could get through the full FFM production website application which is almost precisely the figure cited by Mr. Park.For example your staff had this exchange with Mr. Chao:Q: On July 19th 2 days after the committee’s hearing in which you testified you provided a briefing for the committee. Do you recall this?A: Yes.Q: At the briefing you told committee staff that the system was designed to handle 50000 concurrent users. Is it accurate that the system was designed to handle 50000 concurrent users?A: For the FFM it is. I’m not trying to—Q: When you say “FFM” you mean?A: The marketplace the online application.[8]Mr. Chao also addressed how the results of “stress tests” were used to extrapolate to the full FFM production system:Q: Prior to October 1st did CMS conduct any stress tests for HealthCare.gov?A: Yes. “Stress test” is actually sometimes used synonymously with “performance testing.” Because in performance testing you introduce number of virtual users right? Two hundred 500 1000. You know you’re trying to introduce as many as you can handle in the performance testing environment to see where the breakpoint is. And then once you achieve that breakpoint then you extrapolate you know from that how many concurrent users how many concurrent sessions. Because you don’t have a performance testing environment that equals 100 percent the production environment.[9]Finally your staff asked repeatedly how many users were expected to get through the full FFM production environment based on the testing conducted:Q: So how many concurrent users—what’s the maximum number of concurrent users that the system could handle in a test prior to the October 1st launch?A: The extrapolated figure that we came up with—because in the last remaining weeks we threw some additional resources of capacity. The test was somewhere around—it was somewhere between 48000 and 58000 what we call virtual users. They’re not real live people in there. They’re accounts that are set up you know doing different things in the system. …Q: And you said that 48000 to 58000 virtual users could get through the allocationA: Inside the FFM application the online application for enrollment.[10]ConclusionThis is not the first time you have accused a White House official of being a “paid liar” a practice that several of your Republican colleagues have condemned.[11] Given that your staff participated in Mr. Chao’s transcribed interview last week—before you issued your press release and conducted your television interview—it is unclear why you did not disclose the information Mr. Chao provided but instead chose to accuse Mr. Park and Mr. Carney of misleading the American people.It is evident that the testing conducted for Healthcare.gov was inadequate particularly considering the very high demand experienced in the first days after the website became operational and I believe Congress can play a key role in conducting responsible oversight to ensure that millions of Americans obtain the health insurance coverage they deserve. But it is reckless and highly irresponsible to make unsubstantiated public allegations by taking information out of context especially when the Committee has information in its possession that directly contradicts these unfounded allegations.Rather than rush to issue a subpoena to Mr. Park based on these unsubstantiated allegations which could impair efforts to improve the website I propose that we accept the offer to receive a briefing from Mr. Park this month and that we schedule an additional hearing in December to obtain his full testimony. I sincerely hope that we can proceed in a thoughtful and bipartisan manner as we continue to review this issue.SincerelyElijah E. CummingsRanking Memberhttp://democrats.oversight.house.gov/...,1
458,"President Barack Obama steered Americans away from his administration’s malfunctioning health insurance website Monday at least for now suggesting they use call lines and in-person navigators to sign up instead. And he admitted it’s a mess.The latest fix Obama says is an update on Healthcare.gov telling people how they can buy insurance ""the old-fashioned way — offline.""“So you'll find information about how to talk to a specialist who can help you apply over the phone or to receive a downloadable application you can fill out yourself and mail in” Obama said.His administration has been tight-lipped on just what the problems are with the website which was originally billed as something resembling Travelocity for health insurance — a place online where people could go to compare one plan to another and get a price.But experts point out that HealthCare.gov was never that simple. While most in the industry are confident that Obama can keep his promise to eventually fix the site they say there are multiple places where things may have gone wrong.“Buying a health plan is a lot more complicated than buying a flight"" says Brandon Cruz president of GoHealth a private health insurance marketplace. “When you’re buying a health plan you need to know all the doctors in the network what you deductible will be what your co-insurance will be. And the terminology is so foreign.”Customizing is complicatedNot only that but an airline seat is a fairly generic commodity. Health insurance is personal says Caroline Pearson a vice president at consulting firm Avalere Health. “What’s available for purchase and the price they are going to offer to you for is completely customized on an individual basis” she says.“So in order to give people an accurate shopping experience with accurate pricing you had to enter a lot of personal information about where you live your income the size of your family and then the government has to verify that data. There’s been a lot of up-front electronic verification which seems to be where a lot of the website snafus occurred.”The consensus: the federal website has tried to offer too much too fast to too many people.The federal government is running websites for 36 states that didn’t want to do their own or couldn't manage it right away. Each state has its own insurance regulations and each has its own list of providers offering plans — from 16 different insurance companies in New York to just one for people in some counties in West Virginia.Before you can even begin to shop the website has to know what county you live in. And it needs to check your income to make sure you shouldn’t be on Medicaid instead and to check to see if you qualify for a federal subsidy and if so how much it would be.Oh and it has to check with the Department of Homeland Security to make sure you really are a legal resident — all this while you’re staring at the screen waiting.States let users window-shopPearson says some of the 15 states offering their own websites — Kentucky is an example — have sped up things for users by letting them window-shop first. ""Many of the state websites though not all elected to simplify the process and allow you to shop without creating a login and submitting all your personal information” she says.At first the Obama administration blamed the website hangups on a crush of new users. That's no surprise as the White House says nearly 20 million people have visited the site so far and 500000 have started the application process.But Obama has now admitted it was worse than this and says he has “the best and the brightest” working to fix it.Cruz says there are lots of places where the site could be hanging up. “I don’t think the code was bug-free when the time came to launch” he says. “If the code’s not written properly you can have bottlenecks.”Databases — and there are lots of them on the federal website — are one big potential blockage. “If everyone’s trying to access the database at the same time it locks up” Cruz says.They’re usually designed to freeze while someone is putting information in so that the next person to access it has the most up-to-date information. To use the Travelocity analogy think about choosing your seat on a flight. You’d want to be sure someone didn’t snatch the seat you wanted at the same time you were on there.It's not as simple as adding serversSimply adding servers — a computer or system of computers that increases capacity — won’t help if there’s a bottleneck that keeps people from even reaching the server Cruz points out.Many experts have said the government did not test the system thoroughly enough before launch. And having literally millions of people jump onto a new website on the very first day is a recipe for a mess says Chet Wisniewski senior security adviser for IT security firm Sophos Inc.“When you think about Twitter only a few thousand people knew about it then tens of thousands of people. And after a year when everybody was using it Twitter started to break” Wisniewski says.The Pew Research Center reports that 14 percent of adults report having visited an exchange and another 23 percent say they intend to.Cruz and Pearson think the problems are fixable. So does Tom Scully who was administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) from 2001 to 2004 and who now is a healthcare expert at law firm Alston & Bird.Although much criticism has focused on a Canadian firm CGI Group that did some of the work for the federal government Scully says the administration probably should have contracted out even more of the work. CMS was never equipped to do the work in-house he says.“They are just slow-moving bureaucratic lovely people” Scully said. ""It's just not a core competency of CMS.""The agency likely feared it would be impossible for a company outside the federal government to get the cooperation it would need with the internal Revenue Service Social Security Administration and other federal departments Scully says.Will the phones be just as slow — or slower?And by the way says Pearson sending people to the phone might not be effective either.“People have had a hard time getting through on the phone"" she says. “There have been really long waits on the call center.”Avalere staffers have tried she says. “We have spoken to the call center several times. They haven’t been volunteering to help us enroll” she said.Maybe that will be one of the improvements that Obama has promised she said.And sending in too many of the “best and the brightest’ might not be the right fix either software experts note. They often cite Brook’s Law which holds that adding people to a project slows it down.""It's not like a construction project or an auto assembly line where more hands on deck mean more results"" said Bob Sullivan a technology and consumer expert and author of “The Plateau Effect: Getting from Stuck to Success. ”With software adding people at the end of a project to fix things that are broken or unfinished can actually do more harm than good.""Helen Popkin contributed to this story.

460,The Obama administration decided that Obamacare Navigators tasked with helping Americans enroll in a health insurance plan would not undergo mandatory background checks. Now in the ten weeks since the launch of Healthcare.gov the ill-trained Navigators have put Americans’ sensitive health and tax information at risk.Breitbart News has obtained a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee report on the Obamacare Navigators that will be released Monday. It has found that Obamacare Navigators have been giving Americans misinformation and in some cases actively encouraging enrollees to commit fraud in order to raise their subsidies. To complicate matters further there is no way for Americans to find out whether their Navigators are properly certified.Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said at a Congressional hearing that it was “possible” for convicted felons to become Navigators. The report titled Risks of Fraud and Misinformation with ObamaCare Outreach Campaign: How Navigator and Assister Program Mismanagement Endangers Consumers concludes that is only one of many worries Americans should have about Navigators.The Oversight Committee chaired by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) and HHS actually learned that “poorly-trained Navigators gave consumers incorrect information about the health care exchanges violated HHS rules and procedures and even encouraged applicants to commit tax fraud in some instances.” Moreover this was learned from various news reports due to the complete lack of any internal oversight.On November 21 the Obama administration briefed the Committee. Those in attendance included Gary Cohen the Deputy Administrator and Director of the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO) and Mandy Cohen Director of the Consumer Support Group at CCIIO.The Committee report concluded that “documents call into question the effectiveness of the Navigator program and the Obama administration’s ability to safeguard consumer information.” HHS’s mismanagement of the Navigator and Assister programs “induces fraudulent behavior and poses real threats to the safety of consumers’ personally identifiable information such as one’s social security number yearly income and other sensitive tax information” the report found.The report also discovered that Obamacare Navigators have “encouraged consumers to commit tax fraud by underreporting income in order to qualify for ObamaCare’s health insurance subsidies.” Some have “assisted applicants before completing their 5 to 20 hour online training course and others took custody of paper applications and mailed them for the applicant violating the rule that applicants must mail in the application themselves.”For instance the Committee found:Navigators from the Urban League of Dallas were captured on video encouraging applicants to lie on their health insurance application so the applicants could qualify for tax subsidies. Navigators were also recorded advising an applicant to lie about her smoking habits to obtain a lower monthly premium. It was later discovered that two of the so-called Navigators involved in the incident were assisting consumers with their applications even though they had not completed their training and certification requirements.One self-identified Navigator gave a television interview in which she told viewers blatantly incorrect information–that applicants’ credit scores could impact their eligibility for certain plans. It later came to light that the woman was not a certified Navigator but rather a volunteer with a Navigator organization.Mountain Project Inc. a Navigator organization in North Carolina has been collecting and mailing paper applications on behalf of applicants in violation of Navigator rules and procedures.The report found that HHS officials responsible for the Navigator program did not learn of the aforementioned incidents from internal oversight procedures but rather from news reports.Yet the Obama administration still does not plan to implement a “secret shopper” program to monitor Navigators. HHS officials have put together “webinars” for Navigators but they are voluntary and do not cover specific details.The report also found that because the Obama administration did not warn Navigators that there could be problems with the HealthCare.Gov website “Navigators were essentially useless” when the website crashed and had problems. To make matters worse notes from an October 11 2013 meeting state that the Navigators were encouraging potential enrollees to use paper applications they knew may not bring applicants quicker results “to protect their reputations as people in the communities who can help.”The Committee found that this “push towards the use of paper applications further increases security risks since health insurance exchange applications contain personally identifiable information such as the applicant’s full name social security number the names and social security numbers of everyone in the applicant’s household and income for every member of the household.”The report also concluded that Navigators were also unprepared to handle situations in which consumers mentioned unreported income because the Obama administration did not even anticipate such situations. Gary Cohen the director of the agency overseeing the Navigators previously stated “this could be one of the areas where it is a little beyond the ability of your average Navigator” when asked whether Navigators knew how to deal with Americans who may be engaging in tax fraud or intending to under-report income.Though Cohen “admitted there is a need for better training on the issue through the ongoing education process” and did not rule out “requiring Navigators to report tax fraud in the future” the Obama administration “has not taken the necessary steps to prevent this type of tax fraud.” The report found that Navigators have not even been provided with a document on how to handle potential tax fraud issues that may arise.Navigators the report also found “lack guidance about how to comply with the Voting Rights Act which requires that federal government applications provide the opportunity for applicants to indicate their interest in registering to vote.”And though Cohen told the Committee staff that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services “[keep] a list of certified Navigators which as of mid-November numbered 2500 individuals” the list is private which means Americans do not have a way to know if their Navigators are actually even certified. That also allows Navigator organizations to “misrepresent the qualifications of an individual who is associated with that organization but is not a certified Navigator” the committee found.Navigator Report Update Final 12-13-13,1
461,"By David Lawder and Mark Felsenthal WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House sought to limit the political damage from the troubled rollout of the government's healthcare website on Wednesday as Republicans increased the pressure to delay parts of President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy. Obama administration officials held a closed-door briefing for Democrats in the House of Representatives and a private session with insurance company executives to discuss efforts to fix the Healthcare.gov website. Republican critics in Congress demanded a delay in a requirement of the healthcare law that uninsured Americans must purchase insurance or face a tax penalty and said they would intensify their investigations into the launch of the 2010 Affordable Care Act known as ""Obamacare."" ""It is our job to hold them accountable and when it comes to Obamacare clearly there is a lot to hold accountable"" House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner told reporters on Wednesday. The administration is trying to preserve Democratic Party unity on the issue which showed signs of fraying. The head of the Democratic National Committee Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida told MSNBC the administration should be willing to extend the open-enrollment period for people to sign up for insurance. It ends on March 31. Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina the third-ranking House Democrat criticized the website for forcing consumers to provide private information before deciding what kind of health insurance plan they want to buy. ""I've talked to too many people who tell me before they ever get around to figuring out what it is they want to buy they're having to answer questions that they don't feel they should be answering"" Clyburn said. Max Baucus the Democratic chairman of the Senate Finance Committee said in a statement that he hopes to meet with other committee members in the coming weeks but said he would wait until after the website is repaired. Republicans are not waiting. The House Energy and Commerce Committee on Thursday will hear from the top contractors responsible for the program including website developer CGI Federal. 'WORKING HARD TO FIX THE PROBLEMS' Online exchanges or marketplaces were designed to be the main way for millions of uninsured Americans to research and buy health insurance plans under the law but the October 1 debut has been marred by technical glitches that have kept many from signing on and making purchases. Those unable to sign up online can call a toll-free telephone number as an alternative. The administration has so far declined to disclose the number of enrollments either online or by telephone. A prolonged delay in getting Healthcare.gov to work could jeopardize White House efforts to sign up as many as 7 million people in 2014 the first full year the law takes effect. The administration this week began what it called a ""tech surge"" bringing in experts led by the administration's top economic aide Jeffrey Zients to analyze and fix the problems. ""I think what we learned is they're working hard to fix the problems"" Representative Sander Levin of Michigan senior Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee said after Wednesday's briefing. The Health and Human Services Department will begin regular news briefings on Thursday to provide updates on ""the progress that's being made and on the efforts that are being undertaken both to address the technical problems and to make the whole experience for American consumers better"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. House Democrats said there was no discussion in the briefing about whether the problems should lead to a delay of the individual requirement that every American have insurance or pay a tax penalty. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated a delay would reduce enrollment significantly. REPUBLICANS DEMAND DELAY Republicans who have fought the healthcare law as an unwarranted extension of the federal government said the requirement should be delayed until the problems with the rollout are resolved. ""With so many unanswered questions and the problems arising around this rollout it doesn't make any sense to impose this one percent mandate tax on the American people"" House Republican Leader Eric Cantor told reporters on Wednesday. Republicans have repeatedly tried to derail or delay the healthcare law since taking control of the House in the 2010 elections. They demanded more answers on Wednesday about the scope of the problems. Three committees in the Republican-controlled House have announced investigations of the law's rollout which Cantor described as ""nothing short of a debacle."" HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has been the focal point of criticism and Republicans have demanded she step down but so far the White House has rallied around her. Denis McDonough the White House chief of staff told the New York Times on Tuesday that Sebelius ""has the president's confidence. And she knows that."" In the same article an unidentified White House aide also appeared to try to distance Sebelius from the website troubles and was quoted as saying ""Kathleen has the title but she doesn't have the responsibility or in many respects the kind of wide authority and access to the president that she really needs to make a difference."" Sebelius who will testify to Congress next week and McDonough attended the session with insurance company executives. They included the chief executives of WellPoint Inc Humana Inc and Aetna Inc among others. WellPoint raised its 2013 membership and profit forecasts in part to reflect coming market changes under the law its chief executive Joseph Swedish said in a statement on Wednesday.

462,"President Barack Obama says the disastrous rollout of the HealthCare.gov exchanges were the worst moment of 2013 for him at a White House news conference Friday. LARRY DOWNING / ReutersThe health insurance exchanges were supposed to be the crowning glory of Obamacare -- an easy way to help the 45 million people who don't have health insurance get some. Turns out it hasn't been so easy. The White House has rolled out so many last-minute fixes that critics and supporters alike are asking how anyone can understand what the rules are now.First it was a year’s reprieve for businesses that were supposed to be providing health insurance for workers. Then came a batch of delays exemptions and other exceptions coming to a head late Thursday night as the White House scrambled to announce -- and then clarify -- a break for people who are the most furious about losing their insurance coverage.Republicans piled on Friday saying the White House has now made meaningless the individual mandate – the requirement that everyone have health insurance or pay a tax .Here’s a run-down of what's changed so far:1. The exemption. Thursday night the Obama administration offered a special “hardship exemption” to people whose individual plans were canceled and who have yet to arrange other coverage. They can get either extremely cheap bare-bones plans known as catastrophic coverage or skip health insurance without paying the tax.These catastrophic plans had only been available to people under 30 or those who could not find health insurance plans with premiums costing less than 8 percent of their income. An updated list of exemptions includes those who recently filed for bankruptcy or had medical expenses they couldn't pay among other hardships.2. The slip. Late in November the administration gave people an extra week to get signed up slipping the deadline from Dec. 15 to Dec. 23 for people who wanted to enroll and get health insurance starting the first day possible Jan. 14. This came with a clear admission that the federal online insurance exchange was badly flawed.The site went down again for repairs for several hours on Friday just days before one major deadline for people to use it. ""We screwed it up"" President Obama said in his last news conference of the year.3. The slide. Last week officials gave people another week to pay their first premiums and still get coverage. This was forced on insurers: the industry later said it would let people pay as late as Jan. 10 and still get credit for coverage starting Jan. 1 so long as they had already signed up. It's a big concession — insurers usually like a lot more lead time and they want everything buttoned up including payment before they hand out insurance cards.4. The fix. After an onslaught of attacks about his promise that “if you like you insurance plan you can keep it” Obama formally apologized and said that people could in fact keep their policies – even if they were policies his administration said were rotten and provided lousy coverage. The catch: insurance companies may have already discontinued the plans and state insurance commissioners would have to agree and not all did.5. The redefinition. There was October’s redefinition of what the March 31 deadline meant made after it looked as if people needed to actually sign up by Feb. 15 to make the March 31 deadline to have coverage or pay a tax.6. The delay. Back in July the administration delayed for one year the requirement that large employers provide health insurance for their employees. The 2010 health reform law requires anyone with 50 or more workers to provide health insurance – something small businesses have been complaining about loudly for years. On Tuesday the government said they could have more time to get it done.But Obama says despite the tweaks the law is working.""The basic structure of the law is working despite all the problems"" Obama said.He said at least 500000 people and maybe more have managed to sign up using the federal and state web sites. ""Since that time I now have a couple of million people maybe more who are going to have health care on Jan. 1 and that is a big deal. That's why I ran for this office"" Obama added. California says it got more than 53000 people signed up in just the first three days of this week.None of the delays appear to have helped Obama’s approval rating – the latest NBC/WSJ poll gave Obama a job approval rating of just 43 percent. Half of those surveyed said they are dissatisfied or disappointed with Obama’s presidency and 58 percent say their discontent comes from his handling of health reform.And the delays appear to have rewarded people who want to defy the law’s requirements rather than those who did what the administration asked and signed up early.“This is a slap in the face to the thousands of Americans who have already purchased expensive insurance through the Obamacare exchanges” said Sen. Marco Rubio a Florida Republican who has been an outspoken critic of the 2010 Affordable Care Act.Administration officials called the latest changes “common sense."" ""This is essentially an additional safety net in case folks might have slipped through the cracks"" Obama said. But the insurance industry and critics said they just made things even more bewildering.“One thing is certain: The Administration’s latest initiative is not going to simplify anything” Robert Moffit and Alyene Senger health policy experts at the right-leaning Heritage Foundation wrote in a blog post. “Rest assured it is going to create even greater confusion for health insurers trying to sell these products. Also don’t expect the unhappy consumers who’ve just lost their previous coverage to understand clearly which plan they can pick and be legally qualified to pick it.”Health policy expert Doug Holtz-Eakin who leads the center-right American Action Forum says this week’s changes are “a big deal”. “Substantively it opens the door to deferring the mandate entirely and by acknowledging that catastrophic plans would be suitable coverage it makes a lie of all the rhetoric about how existing insurance (“underinsurance”) is ‘subpar’ and ‘poor’” he wrote in a blog post.“It is an invitation to those who have chosen policies through HealthCare.gov to cancel them and waive the mandate.”Follow Maggie Fox on Facebook and on Twitter.",1
463,A veteran Washington adviser who has worked for four Presidents on both sides of the political aisle said that the stunning Government Accountability Report that found President Barack Obama has not had a one-on-one meeting with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius since the passage of Obamacare over three years ago is an indictment of the entire White House operation and shows that the Obama administration has bordered on “malfeasance.”“I have no doubt the White House is right that Secretary Sebelius was in several group meetings with the president about health care” Gergen caveated “but the whole point is there was nobody in charge in the administration.”Appearing on CNN’s Newsroom program Saturday night was David Gergen a known Washington “fixer.” Some veteran Washington observers have even suggested that Obama should bring Gergen in to help manage the Obamacare rollout crisis. He was asked by CNN Anchor Deborah Feyerick about the GAI report.Feyerick cited a report from “an outfit called the Government Accountability Institute [that] finds the president and HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius held just a single one-on-one meeting after Obamacare was signed into law over three years ago.”“I don’t think this is simply sloppiness on the part of the White House” Gergen said. “What seems to me is there’s a case of near malfeasance here.”Gergen who has served as Director of Speechwriting for the Nixon White House Director of Communications for both Presidents Ford and Reagan and then as a senior advisor to President Bill Clinton is intimately familiar with how the White House operates. In addition he normally takes a “neutral” position on most matters and often gives those in power the benefit of doubt.But Gergen emphasized that the GAI report concerning the lack of meetings between Sebelius and Obama raises troubling issues about the conduct of affairs in the Obama White House.Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large and Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer unveiled the report on Wednesday on Fox News’s Hannity and Breitbart News.As Breitbart News has reported Schweizer said there was no evidence on the White House schedule that showed Obama cared about Obamacare.“In the case of President Obama if you look at his calendar there is no evidence whatsoever that he is focused or has much interest in health care at all” Schweizer said on Hannity.Feyerick the CNN host added that the White House had attacked the report “Jay Carney [is] saying that the report’s misleading and based on a ridiculously false premise those are his words David Gergen what do you think about this?”Gergen responded by saying the GAI report was a big deal and should not be dismissed. On Friday White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Obama and Sebelius meet “regularly” but their meetings were not recored on the visitors logs. Schweizer had previously noted that GAI also looked at White House visitor logs and found that whenever Sebelius went to the White House it was for social functions with “dozens or hundreds of people.” And he noted on Hannity that if Obama met with Sebelius and left the meeting off the books Sebelius would be the only cabinet secretary whose meetings with the White House were concealed.Gergen faulted the White House for this lack of contact and condemned the whole White House operation.“The fact that he was not meeting with her one-on-one I think frankly is not so much an indictment of her but of the White House operation” he said.Gergen said that “at the same time three years pass with no one-on-one meetings according to this Politico article. The president had 277 one-on-one meetings with other members of his cabinet.” Gergen referenced Schweizer’s Politico article in which he mentioned that “perhaps the insular White House team wanted to distance the president from the bureaucratic process in the hopes of granting him a halo of deniability if the launch failed.” Schweizer also noted “the lack of meetings reinforces the severity of what the New York Times describes as the ‘deeply dysfunctional relationship between the Department of Health and Human Services and its technology contractors and tensions between the White House chief of staff and senior health department officials.'”Feyerick the CNN host added that if health care reform “was so important to the president you would think that there was a lot more one-on-one interaction especially on something that’s so critical to him and his policy.” Princeton Professor Julian Zelizer who was also on the panel did not respond directly to the details of the GAI report only to say that “we have to be careful because as the White House said that [report] does come from a conservative organization.”The Government Accountability Institute though is a nonpartisan organization and its mission is to “investigate and expose crony capitalism misuse of taxpayer monies and other governmental corruption or malfeasance.” GAI headed by Schweizer has written several reports in recent years and has been criticized by both the Obama White House and House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH).,1
464,Last week President Obama apologized for misleading the American public with his false claim that “if you like your insurance you can keep it.” Without this assurance it is unlikely ObamaCare would have passed. Obama was not the only politician fudging the truth. Most Democrat lawmakers repeated this claim on the campaign trail and in meetings with constituents. If Obama apologized they should as well as they are equally culpable.Breitbart News has compiled a list of the Top 10 Senate Democrats who should follow Obama’s lead and apologize to the American public. These particular lawmakers either went all-in on the false claim for partisan reasons or were in a position to know that millions of Americans would not be able to keep their health insurance.If a reader interprets this list as a guide for whom to call in Congress so be it.10. SEN. MARY LANDRIEU (D-LA): “If you like the insurance that you have you’ll be able to keep it.” (MSNBC’s Hardball 12/16/09)Mary Landrieu like all Senate Democrats provided the deciding vote on passing ObamaCare. After 3 years it is hard to remember all the parliamentary tricks the Democrats used to pass a bill that almost none of them had read. Landrieu who is up for reelection next year lied on TV. She should apologize.9. SEN. KAY HAGAN (D-NC): “We need to support the private insurance industry so that people who have insurance they’re happy with can keep it while also providing a backstop option for people without access to affordable coverage.” (“Republicans Vent As Other Compromise Plans Get Aired” National Journal’s Congress Daily 6/18/09)160000 residents of North Carolina has lost their health coverage. Sen. Hagan has been most aggressive in trying to separate herself from ObamaCare. No wonder since even a Democrat poll has found her now in a statistical tie with any of her possible Republican challengers. In September Hagan held a 12-17 point lead. She is up for reelection next year and should apologize.8. SEN. MARK BEGICH (D-AK): “If you got a doctor now you got a medical professional you want you get to keep that. If you have an insurance program or a health care policy you want of ideas make sure you keep it. That you can keep who you want.”Begich won his Senate seat in 2008 after DOJ staffers trumped up false charges against the sitting GOP Senator Ted Stevens. Begich is running for reelection in Alaska without the Obama wave and without a mythical DOJ investigation. He should apologize.7. SEN. MICHAEL BENNET (D-CO): “We should begin with a basic principle: if you have coverage and you like it you can keep it. If you have your doctor and you like him or her you should be able to keep them as well. We will not take that choice away from you.”Sen. Bennet heads to DSCC the party arm to elect Democrats to the US Senate. He will have an outsized role in races across the country. He said his position on ObamaCare was based on a “basic principle.” He should apologize.6. SEN. PATTY MURRAY (D-WA): “Again if you like what you have you will be able to keep it. Let me say this again: If you like what you have when our legislation is passed and signed by the President you will be able to keep it.” (Sen. Murray Congressional Record S.6400 6/10/09)Let me say this again as a senior member and now Chair of the Budget Committee Sen. Murray must have been in a position to know that these claims were false. She won her first race for Senate campaigning as a “soccer mom” in “tennis shoes.” Insert your own joke. 290000 residents of Washington have lost their health insurance. She should apologize.5. SEN. TOM HARKIN (D-IA): “One of the things we put in the health care bill when we designed it was the protection for consumers to keep the plan they have if they like it; thus the term ‘grandfathered plans.’ If you have a plan you like –existing policies–you can keep them. …we said if you like a plan you get to keep it and you can grandfather it in.” (Sen. Harkin Congressional Record S.7675-6 9/29/10)Sen. Harkin has long been a slippery politician. As Chair of the Health Committee in the Senate Harkin would have had more intimate knowledge of ObamaCare than most other lawmakers. His yowler here is he tries to claim that the “put in” language to ensure people could keep the plan they like. That is a sin of commission. Harkin who is retiring should absolutely apologize.4. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): “If you like your insurance you keep it.” (U.S. Senate Finance Committee Bill Mark-Up 9/24/09)Schumer who was in a position to know the inner-workings of the law seems to have lied. Asking him for an apology though is like asking Anthony Weiner to become modestly self-aware. Still he should apologize.3. SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL): “This bill before us on the Senate floor makes it clear that if you have an insurance policy that you like you can keep it. If you like the doctor that you’re currently doing business with you can continue to use that doctor.” (Sen. Durbin Teleconference 12/4/09)Durbin is the Number 2 Democrat in the Senate amazingly. He seems preternaturally disposed to obscuring the truth. He actually said the legislation “makes it clear” that you can keep your insurance. He either can’t read legislation or he was intentionally misleading the public. In any event he should apologize.2.SEN. HARRY REID (D-NV):”In fact one of our core principles is that if you like the health care you have you can keep it.” (Sen. Reid Congressional Record S.8642 8/3/09)Core principles apparently aren’t what they used to be. Sen. Reid emptied out the parliamentary cupboard to get ObamaCare passed. As Majority Leader he had to have a keen understanding of what was in the bill and what the consequences would be. The White House at the time was aware of the fact that many Americans would lose their health insurance. Surely Sen. Reid was privy to the same information. He should apologize.And the #1 Senate Democrat who should apologize…1. SEN. MAX BAUCUS (D-MT): “That is why one of the central promises of health care reform has been and is: If you like what you have you can keep it. That is critically important. If a person has a plan and he or she likes it he or she can keep it.” (Sen. Baucus Congressional Record S.7676 9/29/10)Sen. Baucus wrote most of the bill that became ObamaCare. He has been steeped in health care policy for decades. He was in a position to know and had to know that the “central promise” that people could keep their current health care coverage was a lie.He should apologize but unfortunately he has chosen to retire rather than face the voters. I can only hope he does not go softly into the night.,1
465,Now a new report from the minority staff of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce has destroyed the foundation of that particular GOP claim. It projects that only 10000 people will lose coverage because of the ACA and be unable to regain it — or in other words 0.2 percent of the oft-cited 5 million cancellations statistic.The report starts with an assumption that 4.7 million will receive cancellation notices about their 2013 plan. (Notably it doesn’t endorse that figure just takes it on for the sake of argument.) But of those who will get a new plan?AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAccording to the report half of the 4.7 million will have the option to renew their 2013 plans thanks to an administrative fix this year.Of the remaining 2.35 million individuals 1.4 million should be eligible for tax credits through the marketplaces or Medicaid according to the report.Of the remaining 950000 individuals fewer than 10000 people in 18 counties will lack access to an affordable catastrophic plan.“This new report shows that people will get the health insurance coverage they need contrary to the dire predictions of Republicans” said Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) the ranking committee member. “Millions of American families are already benefiting from the law.”The report is somewhat speculative of course since there is no central repository of data on the individual health insurance market. But the methods are clear and the onus is now on Republicans to explain why it isn’t true.As we’ve noted Republicans have had an awful hard time finding people who completely lost coverage because of the ACA. (Think of the man who starred in Americans for Prosperity ads last week and whose story still hasn’t been fully explained.) Perhaps it’s because there just aren’t that many of them.Story continues below advertisementOf course there’s no doubt that for those 10000 people the health-care law left them worse off than before. And by no means is the rocky political ride over for Democrats — back-end problems still present a serious threat to implementation. But as is sadly too often the case the arguments made by Republicans simply lack a firm factual basis — and deserve much more scrutiny that they’ve received in many sectors of the mainstream press.,1

467,"By David Lawder and Mark Felsenthal WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House sought to limit the political damage from the troubled rollout of the government's healthcare website on Wednesday as Republicans increased the pressure to delay parts of President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy. Obama administration officials held a closed-door briefing for Democrats in the House of Representatives and a private session with insurance company executives to discuss efforts to fix the Healthcare.gov website. Republican critics in Congress demanded a delay in a requirement of the healthcare law that uninsured Americans must purchase insurance or face a tax penalty and said they would intensify their investigations into the launch of the 2010 Affordable Care Act known as ""Obamacare."" ""It is our job to hold them accountable and when it comes to Obamacare clearly there is a lot to hold accountable"" House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner told reporters on Wednesday. The administration is trying to preserve Democratic Party unity on the issue which showed signs of fraying. The head of the Democratic National Committee Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida told MSNBC the administration should be willing to extend the open-enrollment period for people to sign up for insurance. It ends on March 31. Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina the third-ranking House Democrat criticized the website for forcing consumers to provide private information before deciding what kind of health insurance plan they want to buy. ""I've talked to too many people who tell me before they ever get around to figuring out what it is they want to buy they're having to answer questions that they don't feel they should be answering"" Clyburn said. Max Baucus the Democratic chairman of the Senate Finance Committee said in a statement that he hopes to meet with other committee members in the coming weeks but said he would wait until after the website is repaired. Republicans are not waiting. The House Energy and Commerce Committee on Thursday will hear from the top contractors responsible for the program including website developer CGI Federal. 'WORKING HARD TO FIX THE PROBLEMS' Online exchanges or marketplaces were designed to be the main way for millions of uninsured Americans to research and buy health insurance plans under the law but the October 1 debut has been marred by technical glitches that have kept many from signing on and making purchases. Those unable to sign up online can call a toll-free telephone number as an alternative. The administration has so far declined to disclose the number of enrollments either online or by telephone. A prolonged delay in getting Healthcare.gov to work could jeopardize White House efforts to sign up as many as 7 million people in 2014 the first full year the law takes effect. The administration this week began what it called a ""tech surge"" bringing in experts led by the administration's top economic aide Jeffrey Zients to analyze and fix the problems. ""I think what we learned is they're working hard to fix the problems"" Representative Sander Levin of Michigan senior Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee said after Wednesday's briefing. The Health and Human Services Department will begin regular news briefings on Thursday to provide updates on ""the progress that's being made and on the efforts that are being undertaken both to address the technical problems and to make the whole experience for American consumers better"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. House Democrats said there was no discussion in the briefing about whether the problems should lead to a delay of the individual requirement that every American have insurance or pay a tax penalty. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated a delay would reduce enrollment significantly. REPUBLICANS DEMAND DELAY Republicans who have fought the healthcare law as an unwarranted extension of the federal government said the requirement should be delayed until the problems with the rollout are resolved. ""With so many unanswered questions and the problems arising around this rollout it doesn't make any sense to impose this one percent mandate tax on the American people"" House Republican Leader Eric Cantor told reporters on Wednesday. Republicans have repeatedly tried to derail or delay the healthcare law since taking control of the House in the 2010 elections. They demanded more answers on Wednesday about the scope of the problems. Three committees in the Republican-controlled House have announced investigations of the law's rollout which Cantor described as ""nothing short of a debacle."" HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has been the focal point of criticism and Republicans have demanded she step down but so far the White House has rallied around her. Denis McDonough the White House chief of staff told the New York Times on Tuesday that Sebelius ""has the president's confidence. And she knows that."" In the same article an unidentified White House aide also appeared to try to distance Sebelius from the website troubles and was quoted as saying ""Kathleen has the title but she doesn't have the responsibility or in many respects the kind of wide authority and access to the president that she really needs to make a difference."" Sebelius who will testify to Congress next week and McDonough attended the session with insurance company executives. They included the chief executives of WellPoint Inc Humana Inc and Aetna Inc among others. WellPoint raised its 2013 membership and profit forecasts in part to reflect coming market changes under the law its chief executive Joseph Swedish said in a statement on Wednesday.

468,Washington D.C.’s insurance commissioner was fired a day after he criticized President Barack Obama’s “administrative fix” for Obamacare.William P. White the D.C. insurance commissioner told the Washington Post that D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray’s top deputies said Gray “wants to go in a different direction” after White was one of the first commissioners to push back against Obama’s “fix.”Though White said he was not told that he was specifically fired for his criticism he “said the timing was hard to ignore.” He said that 24 hours after his criticism he was ‘basically being told ‘Thanks but no thanks.'”Obama in a Thursday White House press conference announced an administrative fix that would allow insurance companies to extend plans that they have cancelled for another year. After that press conference White according to the Post said Obama’s “action today undercuts the purpose of the exchanges including the District’s DC Health Link by creating exceptions that make it more difficult for them to operate.”He also said that he concurred with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’s assessment that Obama’s administrative fix “threatens to undermine the new market and may lead to higher premiums and market disruptions in 2014 and beyond.”According to the Post “White’s statement was removed from the department’s Web site sometime before Friday morning.”White was “Gray’s commissioner for the D.C. Department of Insurance Securities and Banking since February 2011.” D.C. officials said he was removed because any criticism of Obama’s administrative fix needed to be vetted more thoroughly and White failed acknowledge the misstep of not sending his statement criticizing Obama higher up the chain of command before releasing it.After Obama falsely promised Americans that they could keep their insurance plans under Obamacare he has scrambled after millions received cancellation notices and he eventually announced on Thursday his administration will allow insurance companies to let those whose insurance plans were cancelled to re-apply and keep their plans for another year.Whether insurance companies will be allowed to do so though will ultimately rest with the insurance commissioners of the states. And others like Washington state’s insurance commissioner have already rejected Obama’s “administrative fix” vowing to “stay the course” with Obamacare.As the Post noted Obama’s plan “rattled the insurance industry which had set prices for next year based on many of its products changing to comply with the health-care law” because “allowing some plans to continue beyond Jan. 1 could also run afoul of provisions in laws passed by dozens of states and the District to implement” Obamacare.,1
469,Story highlights Ford Vox says the new delay in employer mandate has made him lose faith in Obama's wisdom He says businesses lobbied for delay but the poorly insured and taxpayers pay the price He says move delays penalties protects profits for businesses that don't meet ACA regulations Vox: Mortally wounding Obamacare before midterm elections helps its opponentsEditor’s Note: Ford Vox a brain injury physician at the Shepherd Center in Atlanta writes widely on medicine and health care policy. Follow him on Twitter.(CNN) —As a rehabilitation physician I’ve supported many of the ideas behind the Affordable Care Act since before Barack Obama’s presidency began. During the hot summer of town hall debates surrounding the legislation in 2009 I wrote an essay called “Standing up for Obama’s health plan” and I have continued highlighting the fundamental advances that all of us most especially disabled Americans stand to share under the ACA.But when the Obama administration decided last week to pull out a major pillar of the ACA they lost my faith in their political wisdom.There was a practical necessity to many of the president’s other compromises in order to get the ACA passed. Regrettably it gives states just enough power over insurance marketplaces and the Medicaid expansion to continue the unequal and unfair distribution of state-based social services. It allows states to eviscerate Medicaid in ways that don’t make sense.In some states Medicaid pays to save the life of a stroke victim in the hospital but then denies adequate rehabilitation services and devices to prevent that person’s ongoing health problems from rapidly placing further strain on the thin social-service safety net.Coutesy of Ford Vox Ford VoxThe vast majority of Americans get medical insurance through their employers although the number of employers that offer insurance has fallen 10% since 2000 and the insurance they do offer is increasingly lousy. Low-quality insurance like so-called “mini medical” plans is common. Employees won’t know their coverage is insufficient until it’s too late. If you work for one of these companies and your child suffers a serious trauma the 30 visits or fewer these plans offer for outpatient therapy simply won’t be enough. I’ve seen this gut-wrenching situation time and again.True health care reform must end this sorry state of affairs in the workplace where health care is centered. But by postponing for a year the implementation of the ACA’s requirement that employers with more than 50 full-time workers offer insurance of minimally acceptable quality or face fines of $2000 to $3000 the administration has weakened the core of health care reform. It is delaying a critical national debate on what the ACA minimums should be.How did this happen? The administration caved to pressure from business lobbyists who according to Politico “mounted a coordinated campaign to convince senior White House officials that their date for requiring coverage was simply impractical.” It’s too bad patients and health care providers didn’t get their counterbalancing message out. Without it the business lobby was able to create an atmosphere of false urgency by claiming businesses weren’t ready to start filing the information about the insurance plans they offer (or don’t).Without that critical information the rest of the already heavily compromised ACA apparatus starts to tilt precariously. How can the government enforce the individual mandate which requires people to buy insurance if their employers don’t offer it or if they offer insurance that is substandard or overpriced? Without information from businesses the government won’t know whether individuals are claiming legitimate exemptions or not.The federal government has long excelled at helping private businesses attract and retain workers with affordable benefits. American business lobbyists don’t gripe so much about the nearly $200 billion in tax credits the nation grants their clients by designating employer-offered health benefits nontaxable. You’d think businesses would be pleased that the Congressional Budget Office projects that businesses that don’t offer qualifying insurance plans will be paying only $10 billion in penalties in 2014. Now they’ll be paying zilch.In its notice announcing the ACA delay the administration correctly states that the vast majority of employers already provide insurance. But so what? The ACA is as much about regulating insurance as encouraging businesses to provide it.America’s employers left to their own devices have been exchanging dinky medical insurance for cheaper products and services for too long. Peachtree Hotel Group which owns a variety of chain hotels mostly in the South recently disclosed to The Wall Street Journal how much it nickle-and-dimes the health of its 550 employees. The company’s chief financial officer says it offers a limited benefit plan and now that the ACA is delayed for a year it may increase the employee contribution on the full-benefit plan it was planning to offer next year under the law.The next time you stay at Peachtree’s Courtyard by Marriott in Gulf Shores Alabama know that you could be paying a few cents less for your room so that Peachtree can provide capped health coverage to its valued employees. But if a Peachtree employee were to suffer a catastrophic injury every taxpaying citizen of Alabama would be paying a few cents more to provide the Medicaid coverage and social services the patient needs.Why does it make sense to let companies make irresponsible choices in exchange for a little more profit? These are the kinds of cutthroat business decisions a massive piece of legislation like the ACA should combat.The retail and restaurant lobbyists who stealthily hunted bigger profit margins these past few months will now seize on the act’s wounded carcass. Republicans are already charging that this delay proves the administration knows the ACA is unworkable. They’re using this decision as another opportunity to stop or delay the law.They’re right to do so. The ACA represents a large painful change for a number of American institutions. Hospitals doctors patients insurers and our government are in for a period of turmoil as these changes pulse through society’s many layers. Handing a reprieve to one of those groups is unfair to the rest of us and will distort the necessary debates as specific problems come to light just in time for the 2014 midterm elections.The administration should either delay the whole law until 2015 or go forward in 2014 as planned. Mortally wounding the ACA before the coming battle isn’t compromise – it’s foreshadowing.Follow @CNNOpinion on Twitter.Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion.The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ford Vox.,1
470,The lie of the year according to Politifact is “If you like your health care plan you can keep it.” But the story of the year is a nation waking up to just how radical Obamacare is — which is why it required such outright deception to get it passed in the first place.Obamacare was sold as simply a refinement of the current system retaining competition among independent insurers but making things more efficient fair and generous. Free contraceptives for Sandra Fluke. Free mammograms and checkups for you and me. Free (or subsidized) insurance for some 30 million uninsured. And mirabile dictu not costing the government a dime.In fact Obamacare is a full-scale federal takeover. The keep-your-plan-if-you-like-your-plan ruse was a way of saying to the millions of Americans who had insurance and liked what they had: Don’t worry. You’ll be left unmolested. For you everything goes on as before.That was a fraud from the very beginning. The law was designed to throw people off their private plans and into government-run exchanges where they would be made to overpay — forced to purchase government-mandated services they don’t need — as a way to subsidize others. (That’s how you get to the ostensible free lunch.)It wasn’t until the first cancellation notices went out in late 2013 that the deception began to be understood. And felt. Six million Americans with private insurance have just lost it. And that’s just the beginning. By the Department of Health and Human Services’ own estimates about 75 million Americans would have plans that their employers would have the right to cancel. And millions of middle-class workers who will migrate to the exchanges and don’t qualify for government subsidies will see their premiums deductibles and co-pays go up.1 of 25 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × The Right’s 25 most influential from Townhall.com View Photos The conservative Web site’s latest listing of the most prominent voices on the right with a few names you may not know.

The biggest right-wing radio show host in America has spoken to a generation of conservatives. Micah Walter/Reuters Wait 1 second to continue.It gets worse. The dislocation extends to losing one’s doctor and drug coverage as insurance companies narrow availability to compensate for the huge costs imposed on them by the extended coverage and “free” services the new law mandates.But it’s not just individuals seeing their medical care turned upside down. The insurance providers the backbone of the system are being utterly transformed. They are rapidly becoming mere extensions of the federal government.Look what happened just last week. Health and Human Services unilaterally and without warning changed coverage deadlines and guidelines. It asked insurers to start covering people on Jan. 1 even if they signed up as late as the day before and even if they hadn’t paid their premiums. And is “strongly encouraging” them to pay during the transition for doctor visits and medicines not covered in their current plans (if covered in the patient’s previous — canceled — plan).On what authority does a Cabinet secretary tell private companies to pay for services not in their plans and cover people not on their rolls? Where in Obamacare’s 2500 pages are such high-handed dictates authorized? Does anyone even ask? The bill itself is simply taken as a kind of blanket warrant for HHS to run regulate and control the whole insurance system.Remember the uproar over forcing religious institutions to provide contraception coverage? The president’s “fix” was a new regulation ordering insurers to provide these services for free. Apart from the fact that this transparent ruse does nothing to resolve the underlying issue of conscience — God sees — by what right does the government order private companies to provide free services for anyone?Three years ago I predicted that Obamacare would turn insurers into the lapdog equivalent of utility companies. I undershot. They are being treated as wholly owned subsidiaries. Take the phrase “strongly encouraging.” Sweet persuasion? In reality these are offers insurers can’t refuse. Disappoint your federal master and he has the power to kick you off the federal exchanges where the health insurance business of the future is supposed to be conducted.Moreover if adverse selection drives insurers into a financial death spiral — too few healthy young people to offset more costly sicker older folks — their only recourse will be a government bailout.

471,"By Walter ShapiroMost second-term presidents become fixated on global affairs because the world beyond our shores with all its strife and misery often seems more malleable than life in Washington with its fractious Congress and waning electoral mandate. The trick though for a foreign policy president is to be good at it—and these days those skills appear to be eluding Barack Obama.This week’s biggest rebuke to Obama foreign policy was not Wednesday’s House hearing on Benghazi with its wrenching narrative of the September night that Ambassador Chris Stevens was killed in Libya. Nor was it Friday morning’s revelation of new Benghazi-related documents. More embarrassing was a front-page article in last Sunday’s New York Times detailing how Obama erred last August when he impetuously declared that Syria’s use of chemical weapons in its civil war would be a “red line.”It’s a simple rule: Presidents should never make threats until they have worked out how they would enforce them. But Obama violated it with his stern but ill-considered warning to Syrian strongman Bashar Assad. The Times article quotes one anonymous top government official claiming “What Obama said in August was unscripted” and “nuance got completely dropped.” Barry Pavel a former national security adviser to Obama said flatly “I’m not convinced it was thought through.”Current and former foreign policy advisers usually fall on their swords to protect a president’s reputation for sagacity. Only long afterward when the “if only he had listened to me” memoirs are published do we finally get a glimpse of what really happened in the White House. That’s why it’s telling that Obama insiders are already willing to trash the president for his all-bluster “red line” rhetoric.The reason for the finger-pointing at Obama is that America is now caught in a loose-lips-create-slips dilemma. Without any good policy options available and a growing isolationist mood among voters Obama must decide what to do in response to highly probable evidence that forces loyal to Assad used banned chemical weapons. Arming the rebels many of whom are Islamic militants carries its own risk yet doing nothing makes America appear feckless and irresolute.Playing for time Obama has been reduced to linguistic hair-splitting. Asked at a Tuesday press conference about perceptions that Syria has crossed his supposed red line Obama said lamely “I don't make decisions based on ‘perceived.’ And I can't organize international coalitions around ‘perceived.’ We've tried that in the past by the way and it didn't work out well.”That of course was a reference to George W. Bush and his fallacious weapons-of-mass-destruction pretext for the Iraq War. As a presidential candidate Obama presented himself as the antithesis of this kind of shoot-first foreign policy impetuousness. But as president it’s startling how much Obama resembles Bush in many aspects of national security policy.Take Guantanamo where currently about 100 of the remaining detainees are waging a hunger strike. Asked at a recent press conference about the Bush-era Cuban detention camp that he has repeatedly vowed to close Obama sounded more like an outside critic than a president: “It hurts us in terms of international standing. … It is a recruitment tool for extremists. It needs to be closed.”Despite intermittant efforts by Obama since taking office Congress has refused to allow the president to close Guantanamo. But that does not make Obama a helpless bystander with no control over this symbolic blot on America’s international reputation.The president has refused to use his existing legal authority (using waivers from the Defense Department) to repatriate 86 low-risk detainees mostly from Yemen whose cases have been reviewed by American authorities. Some of these prisoners were rank-and-file al-Qaida soldiers back in 2001 and others were probably picked up by mistake. But today these detainees would be less of a threat sent back to their home countries then they are as enduring symbols of an American gulag on Guantanamo.Then there are the drones. Bush may have initiated the airborne assassination program in 2004 but Obama has made it a hallmark of his response to terrorism. With his drone policy Obama has embraced three of the worst aspects of Bush-era national security policy: an obsession with secrecy; a contorted view of legal norms especially the definition of “imminent threat”; and a refusal to consider that American tactics may create more terrorists than they kill. In Pakistan alone based on the best independent statistics Obama has ordered six times as many drone strikes as ever Bush did.The silence from most Democrats on these troubling aspects of Obama foreign policy has been dispiriting. Had Bush made toothless threats to Syria force-fed prisoners in Guantanamo or rained death from the air in Pakistan on a weekly basis liberals in Congress would be sputtering with outrage. Instead with a few conspicuous exceptions—like Oregon Senator Ron Wyden on drones—the dominant feeling appears to be that if Obama does it it has to be right.Ever since George McGovern lost 49 states to Richard Nixon in 1972 Democrats have cowered in terror at the thought of being branded as soft on national security. This may partly explain Obama’s timorousness on Guantanamo and the president’s embrace of drone strikes as a way of being tough against terrorists without risking American casualties.The Republican obsession with Benghazi is rooted in the belief that the Obama administration was reluctant to label the 2012 Libyan attacks as “terrorism” because that would undermine the president’s narrative in an election year. Wednesday’s hearing—built around the testimony of three mid-level State Department officials—failed to prove anything close to causation. On Friday morning however ABC News reported that the State Department had insisted references to prior warnings on terrorism should be airbrushed out of the initial CIA talking points on the Banghazi attack.This was the briefing document that U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice who drew the short straw as the administration’s TV talker relied on when she made the rounds of Sunday-morning interviews the week of the attacks. Now based on the ABC News story it seems clear that Victoria Nuland a career foreign service officer who was Hillary Clinton’s spokesperson at State had insisted to the White House that these talking points be watered down.Even now so much about Benghazi remains murky including how big a scandal it will actually prove to be. Were Nuland’s editing suggestions primarily designed to politically protect Obama and Clinton? Or was this at its core a Washington bureaucratic battle over which agency should be blamed for the deaths in Libya—State or the CIA?Security was obviously lax in Benghazi. But was that because Stevens was a fearless diplomat who hated hunkering down behind concrete walls? Or was this related to the CIA’s still-mysterious role on the ground in Benghazi? And did the administration’s self-congratulatory belief in the Libyan revolution play a role in the relaxation of vigilence? Remember Libya was Obama’s success story from the ""Arab spring""—the nation where a dictator was toppled by America boldly leading from behind.Despite the documents discovered by ABC News my guess is that the tragedy in Benghazi and its muddled aftermath had far more to do with human error than major-league conspiracy.

Elijah Cummings accuses GOP of trying to ""smear"" officials Another hearing witness said it was ""inexplicable"" attack review ignored key pointsPat Smith whose son died in the Benghazi attack reacts to the hearings on ‘The Lead with Jake Tapper’ CNN today 4pm ET(CNN) —Late on the night of last September 11 U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens spoke to his deputy for the final time from the diplomatic compound in Benghazi Libya.“Greg we’re under attack” Stevens told Gregory Hicks.Within hours Stevens and three other Americans were dead victims of an armed terrorist assault that has since become a political and foreign policy flashpoint in Washington’s partisan wars.The dramatic narrative recounted by Hicks at a six-hour Republican-led House hearing on Wednesday reflected the knowledge of a high-level insider who was in Libya that long night and was deeply involved in trying to react to events.His efforts to determine the circumstances of the attack and muster help for those under siege in eastern Libya were later praised by his superiors and by President Barack Obama.The step-by-step account riveted the Oversight Committee proceeding that was also marked by sharp partisan exchanges over the merits of continued congressional inquiries over the attack.What the Obama administration has said about the Libya attackRepublicans once again accused the Obama administration of trying to cover up the fact that it was a well-orchestrated assault by militants failing to adequately explain events to the public and then refusing to cooperate with congressional investigators.Democrats once again accused Republicans of using tragedy for political gain.Hicks – praised by Republicans as a “whistleblower” but who says he has since been effectively demoted – was joined at the witness table by Eric Nordstrom a former regional security officer in Libya and Mark Thompson the State Department’s acting deputy assistant secretary for counterterrorism.Our goal “is to get answers declared committee chairman Rep. Darrell Issa R-California. “The administration however has not been cooperative.”Hicks described in personal detail how he missed Stevens’ initial call and then reached him by cell phone as the attack unfolded in phases.“I got the ambassador on the other end and he said ‘Greg we’re under attack.’”He recounted the efforts of a security response team on site that drove back the attackers and “repeated attempts” by those on the ground to enter the burning compound to try and rescue Stevens and others.He then said that Stevens was at a hospital that was controlled by a group that he said Twitter feeds identified as leading the attack. Was it a trap to lure more Americans?Then the worst news about his boss.“I received a call from the prime minister of Libya. I think it’s the saddest phone call I’ve ever had in my life. He told me that Ambassador Stevens had passed away” Hicks said.Mother of Benghazi victim: I blame HillaryA slow-to-evolve explanationOversight committee Republicans continued to go after televised remarks by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice five days after the attack. In them she insisted it was the result of a spontaneous demonstration over an anti-Islam film that turned violent.GOP critics believe Rice was shielding Obama at the height of his re-election campaign during which there were times that he trumpeted U.S. successes in combating terrorism including the death of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in 2011.Administration officials say Rice was using official talking points that relied on the best available information at the time.Rep. Patrick McHenry R-North Carolina asked Hicks if there was any evidence early on that the attack was a protest.“No there was none” Hicks said. “I’m confident Ambassador Stevens would have reported a protest immediately if one appeared on his door.”Hicks also said an inflammatory anti-Muslim YouTube video initially cited as a cause of the alleged protest was “a non-event in Libya.”He previously insisted administration officials immediately knew the culprit was al Qaeda.“I think everybody in the mission thought it was a terrorist attack from the beginning” Hicks told investigators in interviews before the hearings.In fact Hicks said during the hearing that he was told by the Libyan president soon afterward that elements with possible terror links were thought to be behind the assault.The veteran diplomat said his “jaw dropped” and he was both “stunned” and “embarrassed” when Rice said the attack was a response to the YouTube video.Boehner calls for White House to release Benghazi emailsHicks also argued the U.S. military could have blunted the attack by scrambling intimidating military aircraft from Italy’s Aviano Air Base – an assertion denied by Joint Chiefs Chairman Martin Dempsey when he testified before Congress in February.Dempsey told Congress it would take up to 20 hours to scramble the aircraft to get to Benghazi; Hicks said he believed it would take two to three hours.“I was speaking from my perspective … on the ground in Tripoli based on what the defense attache told me” Hicks said when asked byRep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland the top Democrat on the Oversight panel asked Hicks if he had any reason to question Dempsey’s assertion.Finally Hicks claimed four members of the military were ready to board a plane from Tripoli to Benghazi but were prevented from doing so by their superiors.“How did the personnel react at being told to stand down?” asked Rep. Jason Chaffetz R-Utah.“They were furious” said Hicks. “I can only say well I will quote Lieutenant Colonel Gibson who said ‘This is the first time in my career that a diplomat has more balls than somebody in the military.’”Pentagon officials insist the members of the military in question were told not to go to Benghazi because they were not equipped for combat and were needed in Tripoli to care for wounded headed their way.Analysis: State Department failed to understand dangerous situation in BenghaziNordstrom said in written testimony it was “inexplicable” that a followup internal State Department review ignored “the role senior department leadership played before during and after” the attack.In the run-up to the hearing Issa trickled out testimony from the witnesses in an apparent attempt to build anticipation for the session one of several that have occurred in Congress focusing on security at the compound and the administration’s response.Committee Democrats accused Republicans of engaging in a “smear” campaign.“What we have seen … is a full-scale media campaign that is not designed to investigate what happened in a responsible and bipartisan way but rather a launch of unfounded accusations to smear public officials” Cummings said.White House spokesman Jay Carney also weighed in telling reporters that the Benghazi attack “is a subject that has from its beginning been subject to attempts to politicize it by Republicans.”He defended defended the administration has “made extraordinary efforts to work with” Congress on multiple investigations.Four Americans killed in Benghazi: Why?Accusation of playing politicsFor its part the State Department also accused House Republicans of playing politics with the tragedy.“This is not sort of a collaborative process where the committee is working directly with us in trying to establish facts that would help you know as we look to keep our people safe overseas in a very complex environment” State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said on Monday.Read the document (pdf)Wednesday’s hearing is another chapter in what has become an epic back and forth between Democrats and Republicans on Benghazi partly stemming from Rice’s televised comments. The comments are widely believed to have cost her a likely nomination to succeed Hillary Clinton as secretary of state.Some congressional Republicans previously sharply questioned Clinton over the administration’s explanation of events and the state of security at the compound at the time of the attack.Clinton has said that she accepted responsibility for the deaths declaring that as secretary of state she was “in charge of the State Department’s 60000-plus people all over the world.”In January Clinton testified for more than five hours before the House and Senate Foreign Relations committees. In her testimony she acknowledged a “systematic breakdown” on Benghazi and said her department was taking additional steps to increase U.S. security at diplomatic posts.At one point at that hearing Clinton barely controlled her anger as she responded to a lawmaker who pressed her on the administration’s post-attack storyline.Critics have questioned the validity of continued congressional scrutiny especially Democrats who say Republicans are only interested in discrediting the administration and hurting Clinton’s chances if she were to run for president in 2016.Former deputy chief of mission in Libya: U.S. military assets told to stand downOne Republican congressman Ohio’s Jim Jordan used the hearing to criticize top Clinton adviser Cheryl Mills.Hicks said he received a call from Mills who he added was not happy that a State Department lawyer – described by Republicans as a minder – was excluded from a briefing on Benghazi in Libya with Hicks a Republican congressman and others.Hicks has been “praised by everybody who counts the president the secretary everyone above him” Jordan said. “And yet now they’re obstructing – because he won’t – he won’t help them cover this up.”But former Clinton aide Philppe Reines disputed that characterization saying the State Department took a cooperative approach with Congress. He said in a written statement that Mills had in fact called Hicks to support him.“She wanted (people on the ground in Libya) to know that no matter how far away they were from home they weren’t alone” Reines said. “She was with them and most importantly (Secretary Clinton) was with them.”CNN’s Dana Bash Elise Labott and Dan Merica contributed to this story.",1
473,WASHINGTON — In the latest fallout from the Edward Snowden affair the president of Brazil canceled a state visit to Washington out of anger that the National Security Agency had spied on her and other Brazilian officials deepening a rift with the Obama administration.Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff on Tuesday called off the high-profile visit that both governments had planned for Oct. 23. A White House spokesman sought to downplay the diplomatic snub by a key ally and trading partner and described the decision to indefinitely postpone the visit as mutual.AdvertisementThe White House said in a statement that Rousseff and President Obama had agreed that the state visit — an elaborate affair with meetings and a formal dinner with toasts — would be better staged when relations between the two nations were less tense.Obama “understands and regrets” the concern that disclosures about U.S. spying has generated in Brazil the statement said. “He is committed to working together with President Rousseff and her government in diplomatic channels to move beyond this issue as a source of tension in our bilateral relationship.”AdvertisementA statement from the Brazilian president’s office was harsher citing a “lack of ... explanations and commitment to cease interceptive activities” for the cancellation.“The illegal interception of communications data belonging to citizens companies and members of the Brazilian government are a grave matter an assault on national sovereignty and individual rights and are incompatible with relations between friendly nations” the statement said.AdvertisementSince July Brazilian news organizations have carried three reports based on classified documents leaked by Snowden a former systems administrator at an NSA listening post. One indicated that the intelligence agency had intercepted communications between Rousseff and her aides among other senior officials.Rousseff quickly denounced the eavesdropping and aides said she wanted an apology from Obama and was reconsidering her invitation to Washington.AdvertisementObama tried to head off the rebuke. At a meeting this month of the Group of 20 nations in St. Petersburg Russia he added a meeting with Rousseff to his schedule and offered to address her concerns. National security advisor Susan Rice met with her Brazilian counterpart last week.But the outreach failed. On Monday the two leaders spoke by phone and agreed to delay the pomp and circumstance of a state visit so it would “not be overshadowed by a single bilateral issue no matter how important or challenging the issue may be” the White House said.AdvertisementThe cancellation marks the second presidential visit scrapped because of diplomatic umbrage related to Snowden and the trove of secret surveillance documents he has leaked to news media.Obama canceled a planned meeting in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin last month after Putin offered Snowden temporary asylum. The two leaders met informally days later in St. Petersburg however and both governments have endorsed a joint plan to disarm Syria of chemical weapons.AdvertisementThe invitation to Rousseff the only state visit the White House had planned this year was widely seen in Brazil as affirmation of its rising status on the international stage. But Rousseff appears to have calculated that reprimanding Washington over spying was more important for her domestic audience than a sit-down in the Oval Office.“Slapping Obama in the face standing up to the big neighbor in the North will be much hyped here and could increase her popularity as she faces elections next year” said David Fleischer a political scientist at the University of Brasilia. “It increases Brazil’s standing in the world by saying we can stand up to the U.S. when they did something very nasty to us.”Advertisement“The issue of spying would have dominated the Washington visit” said Peter Hakim president emeritus at the Inter-American Dialogue a Washington think tank that focuses on relations with Latin America. “And Rousseff must have been nervous that something more could come out [from Snowden] before then.”A Brazilian government commission met Tuesday with officials at the Russian Embassy to explore the possibility of a visit to Russia to meet with Snowden. Rousseff also is promoting legislation that would require Google Facebook and other technology companies to store data collected in Brazil on Brazilian soil and therefore submit it to Brazilian law. Rousseff plans to speak on spying at the United Nations General Assembly next week.AdvertisementThe White House glossed over the downturn in relations but the delay could have implications for U.S. businesses. Among the likely topics of discussion were a multibillion-dollar contract to sell Boeing aircraft as well as access to oil fields for U.S. companies said Carl Meacham director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.“This signals a different kind of environment for the U.S.” said Meacham.Advertisementkathleen.hennessey@latimes.comTimes staff writer Hennessey reported from Washington and special correspondent Bevins from Sao Paulo Brazil.

474,WASHINGTON — At a news conference in a rainy Rose Garden on Thursday President Obama and the Turkish prime minister had weighty matters to discuss — the bloody civil war in Syria a disastrous Syrian refugee crisis and Turkey’s strained relationship with Israel. But before they got too far into that Obama had something else to say.“With the prime minister’s permission I want to make one other point” Obama said launching into an appeal for Congress to support more money for embassy security — a not-so-subtle reply to Republicans who’ve pounced on the president’s handling of last year’s attack on the diplomatic post in Benghazi Libya.AdvertisementThe remark signaled how Obama and his aides have decided to respond to the pounding they have taken in recent days as three controversies have threatened to interfere with his second-term agenda. The White House has tried to showcase Obama as a pragmatic leader taking decisive action contrasting him with what the president’s aides see as a Washington establishment obsessed with scandal.PHOTOS: Obama’s scandal-filled weekAdvertisement“My concern is making sure that if there’s a problem in the government that we fix it” Obama said one of five times he used the word “fix” in his comments.Signs of the strategy have been large and small touching each of the controversies that have dominated the news cycles of the last week.AdvertisementOn Wednesday administration officials announced support for a law to shield the news media from at least some subpoenas in criminal investigations a move to deflect criticism from liberals over a federal prosecutor’s decision to seize telephone records of Associated Press reporters.Then the White House released 99 pages of emails related to the Benghazi attack aimed at proving wrong those who claimed the administration had politicized the event.AdvertisementLittle more than an hour later Obama appeared in the East Room to announce on live television that he had pushed out the acting IRS commissioner seeking to show he would move quickly to straighten out the tax agency after an inspector general’s report released Tuesday concluded that it had inappropriately targeted conservative groups.On Thursday in addition to his remarks on embassy security Obama appointed a new acting commissioner to take over at the Internal Revenue Service and made his first comments on the AP subpoenas. Obama said he respected press freedom but defended aggressive investigations of leaks as necessary to protect American personnel overseas saying “I make no apologies.”AdvertisementDOCUMENT: The Inspector General’s report on the IRSThe president also sought to demonstrate he was handling other crises that were nearly overlooked gathering top military brass at the White House after a report estimated that 26000 military members were sexually assaulted in unreported incidents last year.AdvertisementThe moves came after pressure from Democrats outside the White House. Many feared that the president’s Mr. Cool approach would not overcome the familiar churn of the Washington scandal machine.One Democratic strategist who asked not to be identified to preserve relations with the administration said early in the week that he called a senior administration official to find out when the West Wing was going to come out fighting. “They didn’t want to get out ahead of the facts” he said was the answer he got.AdvertisementTommy Vietor a former National Security Council spokesman defended the White House response. “They took their time” he said. “They reviewed the IG’s report they declassified the emails they got their facts together. They didn’t care about one 24-hour news cycle.”The game of scandal response is relatively new to a White House that prides itself on its low blood pressure and control of the news cycle. White House aides privately vented about the frustration of feeling unable to push their message set the record straight or change the subject.AdvertisementThe White House has since tried to thaw the chill with the press. On Wednesday Press Secretary Jay Carney tried to lighten the tone at his briefing with a self-effacing joke and reference to a viral video mocking his frequent use of the phrase “I appreciate the question” for questions he doesn’t especially appreciate. Senior advisor Dan Pfeiffer who rarely does television interviews also appeared on CNN on Thursday to urge Democrats and Republicans to come together to “fix the problem.”PHOTOS: The controversy over BenghaziAdvertisementOther surrogates will be pushing the message soon. As the president spoke to the media in the Rose Garden on Thursday a who’s who of Democratic spin-masters and veterans of scandals past met inside with Chief of Staff Denis McDonough and Pfeiffer. Former Clinton Press Secretary Mike McCurry Clinton speechwriter Don Baer and Tad Devine who was an advisor to Vice President Al Gore huddled with others for what participants said was an occasional get-together.“This is what passes for a scandal these days?” quipped one longtime Democratic strategist.AdvertisementThe president’s attempt to change the subject included his meeting at the White House with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to discuss sexual harassment in the military. The subject gained credence not only because of the report on undisclosed assaults but also because of the sexual abuse investigations of two servicemen who coordinated sexual assault prevention programs.The media were allowed in for photos and his comments.AdvertisementObama said sexual assault in the military was “not a sideshow” a label his advisors use to describe the controversy over the Benghazi talking points and he assured military leaders he would be working on the issue.“There’s no silver bullet to solving this problem” Obama said. “This is going to require a sustained effort over a long period of time.”AdvertisementIt’s not yet clear whether the newfound strategy will turn the tide for the White House. Republicans on Capitol Hill did not let up after the release of the Benghazi emails saying the documents did not back up the White House version of events. “If the White House wants to get out of hot water they should just start being candid” said Brendan Buck spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio).Some Obama partisans however are relieved said Neera Tanden president of the progressive think tank Center for American Progress. “Most people most Democrats think they turned the corner” she said.Advertisementkathleen.hennessey@latimes.comchristi.parsons@latimes.com,1
475,WASHINGTON — President Obama facing implacable opposition to a strike against Syria in Congress and throughout the country said Tuesday that he would hold off on military action for now and pursue a Russian proposal for international monitors to take over and destroy Syria’s arsenal of chemical weapons.Speaking to the nation from the White House Mr. Obama laid out his most extensive and detailed case for an attack to punish Syria for its use of chemical weapons. But he also acknowledged the deep doubts of Americans who after the experience of Iraq and Afghanistan view any form of military engagement in Syria with alarm.In a speech that only 48 hours ago was going to be solely a call to arms Mr. Obama instead offered a qualified endorsement of a proposal that his own advisers conceded was rife with risk given Russia’s steadfast refusal to agree to any previous measures to pressure Syria its longtime ally.“It’s too early to tell whether this offer will succeed and any agreement must verify that the Assad regime keeps its commitments” Mr. Obama said. “But this initiative has the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons without the use of force.”,1
476,By now most of you have received the report from Al Ortiz about the problems with the 60 Minutes story on Benghazi.There is a lot to learn from this mistake for the entire organization. We have rebuilt CBS News in a way that has dramatically improved our reporting abilities. Ironically 60 Minutes which has been a model for those changes fell short by broadcasting a now discredited account of an important story and did not take full advantage of the reporting abilities of CBS News that might have prevented it from happening.As a result I have asked Lara Logan who has distinguished herself and has put herself in harm’s way many times in the course of covering stories for us to take a leave of absence which she has agreed to do. I have asked the same of producer Max McClellan who also has a distinguished career at CBS News.As Executive Producer I am responsible for what gets on the air. I pride myself in catching almost everything but this deception got through and it shouldn’t have.When faced with a such an error we must use it as an opportunity to make our broadcast even stronger. We are making adjustments at 60 Minutes to reduce the chances of it happening again.There is a lot of pride at CBS News. Every broadcast is working hard to live up to the high standard set at CBS News for excellence in reporting. This was a regrettable mistake. But there are many fine professionals at 60 Minutes who produce some of the very best of broadcast journalism covering the important and interesting stories of our times and they will continue to do so each and every Sunday.Jeff FagerChairman CBS NewsExecutive Producer 60 MinutesSUMMARY OF FINDINGSMy review found that the Benghazi story aired by 60 Minutes on October 27 was deficient in several respects:--From the start Lara Logan and her producing team were looking for a different angle to the story of the Benghazi attack. They believed they found it in the story of Dylan Davies written under the pseudonym “Morgan Jones”. It purported to be the first western eyewitness account of the attack. But Logan’s report went to air without 60 Minutes knowing what Davies had told the FBI and the State Department about his own activities and location on the night of the attack.--The fact that the FBI and the State Department had information that differed from the account Davies gave to 60 Minutes was knowable before the piece aired. But the wider reporting resources of CBS News were not employed in an effort to confirm his account. It’s possible that reporters and producers with better access to inside FBI sources could have found out that Davies had given varying and conflicting accounts of his story.--Members of the 60 Minutes reporting team conducted interviews with Davies and other individuals in his book including the doctor who received and treated Ambassador Stevens at the Benghazi hospital. They went to Davies’ employer Blue Mountain the State Department the FBI (which had interviewed Davies) and other government agencies to ask about their investigations into the attack. Logan and producer Max McClellan told me they found no reason to doubt Davies’ account and found no holes in his story. But the team did not sufficiently vet Davies’ account of his own actions and whereabouts that night.--Davies told 60 Minutes that he had lied to his own employer that night about his location telling Blue Mountain that he was staying at his villa as his superior ordered him to do but telling 60 Minutes that he then defied that order and went to the compound. This crucial point – his admission that he had not told his employer the truth about his own actions – should have been a red flag in the editorial vetting process.--After the story aired the Washington Post reported the existence of a so-called “incident report” that had been prepared by Davies for Blue Mountain in which he reportedly said he spent most of the night at his villa and had not gone to the hospital or the mission compound. Reached by phone Davies told the 60 Minutes team that he had not written the incident report disavowed any knowledge of it and insisted that the account he gave 60 Minutes was word for word what he had told the FBI. Based on that information and the strong conviction expressed by the team about their story Jeff Fager defended the story and the reporting to the press.--On November 7 the New York Times informed Fager that the FBI’s version of Davies’ story differed from what he had told 60 Minutes. Within hours CBS News was able to confirm that in the FBI’s account of their interview Davies was not at the hospital or the mission compound the night of the attack. 60 Minutes announced that a correction would be made that the broadcast had been misled and that it was a mistake to include Davies in the story. Later a State Department source also told CBS News that Davies had stayed at his villa that night and had not witnessed the attack.--Questions have been raised about the recent pictures from the compound which were displayed at the end of the report including a picture of Ambassador Stevens’ schedule for the day after the attack. Video taken by the producer-cameraman whom the 60 Minutes team sent to the Benghazi compound last month clearly shows that the pictures of the Technical Operations Center were authentic including the picture of the schedule in the debris.--Questions have also been raised about the role of Al Qaeda in the attack since Logan declared in the report that Al Qaeda fighters had carried it out. Al Qaeda’s role is the subject of much disagreement and debate. While Logan had multiple sources and good reasons to have confidence in them her assertions that Al Qaeda carried out the attack and controlled the hospital were not adequately attributed in her report.--In October of 2012 one month before starting work on the Benghazi story Logan made a speech in which she took a strong public position arguing that the US Government was misrepresenting the threat from Al Qaeda and urging actions that the US should take in response to the Benghazi attack. From a CBS News Standards perspective there is a conflict in taking a public position on the government’s handling of Benghazi and Al Qaeda while continuing to report on the story.--The book written by Davies and a co-author was published by Threshold Editions an imprint of Simon & Schuster part of the CBS Corporation. 60 Minutes erred in not disclosing that connection in the segment.Al OrtizExecutive Director of Standards and PracticesCBS News,1
477,In the White House’s latest efforts at transparency the administration announced to reporters that it would brief reporters on the latest shocking developments about the Benghazi situation … behind closed doors. Politico reports that the meeting started at approximately 12:45 PM ET and that it moved the normal press briefing to 1:45 PM ET. Jay Carney White House press secretary did not comment on whether the meeting took place.Politico reports:The off-the-record session was announced to reporters in the wake of an ABC News report showing that White House and State Dept. officials were involved in revising the now-discredited CIA talking points about the attack on Benghazi.The administration routinely exerts pressure on reporters it feels are not kind enough in their coverage. Reporters like Cheryl Attkisson of CBS News have felt the hand of their bosses for “wading dangerously close to advocacy” with regard to Benghazi. No doubt this “off-the-record” meeting was designed to get all the president’s horses and all the president’s men to put the Benghazi humpty dumpty together again.UPDATE: Reporters not invited to the off-the-record briefing are reportedly incredibly unhappy about it:UPDATE II: Jake Tapper of CNN reports that the regularly scheduled press briefing has been delayed even further:UPDATE III: Politico now reports that the meeting has been characterized as “deep background.” The existence of the meeting itself is considered “off-the-record.” White House spokesman Josh Earnest said “Deep background means that the info presented by the briefers can be used in reporting but the briefers can’t be quoted.” So expect a fair number of “White House sources” to appear in reportage for the next few days.UPDATE IV: Jay Carney began his on-the-record press briefing by announcing that 14 news organizations were invited to the closed door briefing but that it was not a substitute for the on-the-record briefing. He then announced that it was “erroneous” to describe the briefing as “off-the-record” and instead suggested it was “deep background.”Ben Shapiro is Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News and author of the New York Times bestseller “Bullies: How the Left’s Culture of Fear and Intimidation Silences America” (Threshold Editions January 8 2013).,1
478,On Friday two prominent Republican backers of the Senate immigration bill hosted a conference call with reporters to reveal the “history” behind some organizations opposing the legislation. According to the speakers a significant amount of the opposition to immigration reform is being led by liberals environmentalists and pro-abortion and eugenics activists worried about population growth.“[T]he primary leaders and funders of the anti-immigration movement were drawn to it because they were also active organizers and supporters of and contributors to the population-control movement in the United States” Mario Lopez a speaker on the call recently wrote. Lopez is President of the Hispanic Leadership Fund. Lopez was joined on the call by Josh Culling with Grover Norquist’s Americans for Tax Reform.This ad hominem argument is both inane and irrelevant. People come into issues from all kinds of vantage points. I have no doubt that there active immigration reform opponents who are liberals or have overblown worries about population growth. Those views however don’t discredit what they may say on a different issue. Nor do those views discredit what people without those views believe on an issue.Friday’s call was a leftist tactic to discount what millions of Americans feel about an issue because some other people hold views with which they would disagree. It was reminiscent of the media’s attempt to smear the entire Tea Party movement because a handful of people said or did something stupid.Even if one were to cede the premise that an entire infrastructure to oppose immigration reform were built by population control activists the fact is immaterial to the concerns many have about the legislation before the Senate. Even if you support expansive legal immigration it is a bad bill. Its fatal flaw is that it doesn’t secure the border or increase enforcement in any meaningful way. One doesn’t have to be a population control zealot to see the fundamental problem with that approach.Surely the speakers would hopefully acknowledge there are many opposed to the Senate bill who don’t believe in population control. I would wager the overwhelming majority of Americans who have concerns about the bill are not advocates of abortion or eugenics to control the population. So why are the views of a decided minority relevant to an issue with national implications?The richest irony of the call was that the speakers are allies of groups like SEIU and La Raza in supporting the specific Senate proposal. One could just as easily have a convened a press call to discuss the “history” behind these groups and why conservatives should be cautious about working with them. The speakers on the call for example acknowledged doing at least some work with the National Immigration Forum which has received considerable funding from George Soros’ Open Society Institute. Is that the proper alliance for a conservative?No one should schedule such a call however. Issues should be decided on merits not ad hominem aspersions about someone else’s motives. The call was an attempt to smear all opposition to the Senate bill as arising out of the questionable beliefs of a few people. It was an attempt to quash rather than foster debate on the underlying merits of the proposal.The call also perpetuated a dangerously false choice. Conservatives should either accept legislation largely written by Sen. Chuck Schumer or be labeled as against reform. That our allies are forcing this choice is unconscionable.,0
479,"In Chile they call his acts of buffoonery “Piñeri-cosas"" – and boy as Pineri-cosas go this one was a doozy.In an apparent first for a world leader visiting the White House Chilean President Sebastian Pinera on Tuesday briefly co-opted the President of the United States’ – in this case obviously Barack Obama – Oval Office desk.""I’m going to sit at the President of the United States’ desk"" Pinera states in Spanish before undertaking the bit of foolery that reportedly broke all manner of long-held White House protocols for visiting leaders according to a YouTube video of the unfortunate event.[pullquote]Pinera then decisively rounds the hallowed workspace at which Lincoln Roosevelt – both Teddy and Franklin D. -- JFK and 40 others penned into law untold acts of world-changing legislation not to mention declarations of war and related political bric-a-brac – and makes himself rather comfortably at home although without thankfully going so far as to put his feet up on the desk.Perhaps to break the obvious tension Alfredo Moreno Charme the Chilean Minister of Foreign Affairs reportedly asked a seemingly awestruck Obama ""How many other presidents have done the same?""To his credit a cordial and by-then-bemused Obama who quickly recovered from his initial and barely perceptible bout of surprise responded in Spanish “Este es el unico” or “This is the only one.”Boisterous laughter ensued among the more than dozen or so dignitaries arranged around the history-laden room at which point Pinera awkwardly justified the gaffe by explaining ""You know my daughter was born here.”And indeed Pinera a billionaire businessman who ascended in 2010 to his country’s highest office has rather rich American ties.He reportedly spent some early childhood in New York City and attended Harvard University before attaining a degree from the prestigious school. However his political career has reportedly been beset by the sort of obvious failures he rarely – if ever – experienced in the business world.The reported ample archive of his sundry missteps has reportedly given way to his countrymen’s characterization of similar clownishness as the one apparent on Tuesday in the Oval Office as “Pineri-cosas.”",1
480,Story highlights Lawmakers blast Russia for allowing Edward Snowden to land in Moscow 'That's not how allies should treat one another' says Sen. Schumer Debate persists over whether Snowden is a hero or a traitor(CNN) —The fragile U.S.-Russia relationship – already frayed by disagreements over Syria Iran and nuclear arms – showed another sign of strain Sunday as American lawmakers blasted the country’s President Vladimir Putin for allowing NSA leaker Edward Snowden to land in Moscow while evading U.S. espionage charges.Snowden who has admitted leaking top-secret information about government surveillance programs left Hong Kong on Sunday and later touched down in Moscow according to Wikileaks which helped him travel. While Russia is not believed to be his final destination – Ecuador’s prime minister said Snowden applied for asylum in his country – lawmakers on Sunday were quick to fault Putin for harboring a man the U.S. government desperately wants back.“Putin always seems almost eager to put a finger in the eye of the United States whether it is Syria Iran and now of course with Snowden” Sen. Chuck Schumer said on CNN’s State of the Union. “That’s not how allies should treat one another and I think it will have serious consequences for the United States-Russia relationship.”That relationship was already showing signs of strain at last week’s Group of Eight conference in Northern Ireland where global leaders pressured Putin on his country’s support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad which extends back to the Cold War and Assad’s father. At a joint appearance that followed a bilateral meeting last week Putin and President Barack Obama were tense and unsmiling and offered no indication their deep disagreements about the way forward in war-torn Syria were any closer to being resolved.Why would Snowden head for Ecuador?Later in the week Obama publicly pressured Russia to join the United States in slashing its supply of nuclear weapons saying both nations needed to “move beyond Cold War nuclear postures.”Obama delivered his remarks at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin which for decades symbolized the East-West divide.On Sunday however the divide between the United States and Russia persisted. Schumer a New York Democrat suggested on CNN that Putin personally approved Snowden’s landing in Moscow on Sunday.“Very few are the areas in which he does cooperate (with the U.S.) these days. I think this action Putin allowing Snowden to land in Russia and then go somewhere else is going to have serious consequences for the U.S.-Russian relationship” Schumer said.His characterization of Russia’s stance was echoed by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham an infrequent ally of Schumer’s who spoke on “Fox News Sunday.”“I hope we’ll chase him to the ends of the earth bring him to justice and let the Russians know there will be consequences if they harbor this guy” said Graham who represents South Carolina.“They want to be part of the world community the (World Trade Organization). They want a good relationship with the United States. They should hold this felon and send him back home for justice” Graham said. Russia joined the World Trade Organization last August after nearly two decades of negotiations. Before being admitted it was the largest economy not represented at the global trade body.As lawmakers spoke Sunday it remained unclear where Snowden’s final destination would be though he was not expected to remain in Russia. Snowden’s U.S. passport has been revoked according to a source familiar with the matter setting up any travel out of Russia to become a major diplomatic flashpoint.“Persons wanted on felony charges such as Mr. Snowden should not be allowed to proceed in any further international travel other than is necessary to return him to the United States” State Department Spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement.Earlier in June Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia would consider a request for political asylum from Snowden but that such a request from the NSA leaker had not yet been made.Peskov in an indication of the Kremlin’s stance also wrote on Twitter “The U.S. security services were breaking the laws of their country by tapping phone calls and conducting Internet surveillance.”Wikileaks’ Assange urges support for Snowden slams Obama“Snowden same as Assange is a human rights activist” he continued referring to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange currently holed up at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London where he’s been granted asylum.Asked Sunday whether he believed Putin had advance knowledge of Snowden’s travel plans Rep. Mike Rogers the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee said “That wouldn’t surprise me.”“Russia is a country that wants to get back on the world stage and I don’t think they really care if they do it in a way that’s in the best interest of good citizenship around the world” Rogers said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” citing Putin’s stance on Syria and nuclear disarmament.“I’m sure they would love to have a little coffee and a few conversations with Mr. Snowden” continued the Michigan Republican referring to the Russians. “That’s why this is so serious and why we need to be so aggressive in making sure that people understand the difference between somebody who betrays their country and gives secrets away that will protect American lives at the expense of whatever he hopes to gain in the company of the Russians.”Rogers’ remarks underscored the debate between those who believe Snowden committed an act of treason and those who view him as a hero promoting greater government transparency. The debate has created unlikely alliances in Washington where some Democrats find themselves on the same side as Republicans – and opposite their base – in calling for Snowden’s arrest.An empty debate? Why little will happen to change how we snoopRep. Nancy Pelosi the House Democratic leader was loudly booed and heckled at a conference of progressives Saturday when she asserted Snowden had broken the law. Earlier she drew a distinction between lawmakers like herself who oversee the nation’s security and privacy-minded citizens.“I know that some of you attribute heroic status to that action” she said referring to Snowden’s leaks. “But again you don’t have the responsibility for the security of the United States. Those of us who do have to strike a different balance.”“I don’t think this man is a whistle-blower” another California Democrat Sen. Dianne Feinstein said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “Whatever his motives are and I take him at face value he could have stayed and faced the music. I don’t think running is a noble thought.”That view was countered by Sen. Rand Paul a libertarian-minded Kentucky Republican who has been one of the few U.S. lawmakers to praise Snowden. While he warned Snowden would be discredited if he “cozies up to the Russian government” Paul suggested the former CIA employee had lived up to his duty as a citizen by exposing what he felt were government misdeeds.“I would say that Mr. Snowden hasn’t lied to anyone. He did break his oath of office but part of his oath of office is to the Constitution” Paul said on CNN adding: “He was simply coming forward and telling the truth – that your government was lying.”Obama takes NSA controversy to nascent watchdog group,1

482,Speaking in Ireland this week President Obama stated that Catholic schools were divisive: “If towns remain divided–if Catholics have their schools and buildings and Protestants have theirs if we can’t see ourselves in one another and fear or resentment are allowed to harden–that too encourages division and discourages cooperation.” On Thursday the American Catholics for Religious Freedom fired back on President Obama’s words to 2000 young people at the G8 Summit stating “President Obama’s anti-faith secular agenda was shamefully on full display yesterday when he told the young people of Northern Ireland that Catholic education and other faith-based schools were divisive and an obstacle to peace. All Americans of faith should be outraged by these comments which clearly telegraph the President’s belief system and are in fact at their core even anti-American.”American Catholics for Religious Freedom points out that the media has completely ignored the story and adds “Secular progressives like President Obama ignore the truth that faith-based education is a component of the Religious Freedom guaranteed by the Constitution. He can’t bear the thought that Catholic and parochial schools not only teach important values but consistently produce better educational results at lower cost than America’s failing public schools. The President’s troubling values are showing here in a way that demonstrate just how dangerous this Administration is and how committed it is to eroding the rights of all people of faith.”And they note this is the same President who has attempted to cram down anti-Catholic doctrine via Obamacare. “It’s time Americans stood up for Religious Freedom for the U.S. Constitution and against President Obama’s radical views about the place of faith in American life” the group concludes.Ben Shapiro is Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News and author of the New York Times bestseller “Bullies: How the Left’s Culture of Fear and Intimidation Silences America” (Threshold Editions January 8 2013).,1
483,The alleged use of deadly chemical weapons by the Syrian regime against civilians and opponents on the anniversary of President Barack Obama’s “red line” statement might have marked the collapse of Obama’s foreign policy–if such policy actually existed. In fact however the Obama administration has no foreign policy other than its continued opposition to the perceived postures of George W. Bush more than four years gone.Obama’s policy in Syria had been to rehabilitate the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad. Well before he won the presidency Democrats–including current Secretary of State John Kerry–made a point of visiting Assad to show their approach to foreign relations was different from and more effective than the allegedly confrontational approach of the Bush administration. Syria’s nuclear weapons program exposed when Israel destroyed it in 2007 did not prompt any change in Democrats’ approach to the regime.Therefore Obama renewed diplomatic relations and re-opened the U.S. embassy in Damascus elevating the status of the regime. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton even referred to Assad as a “reformer.” The hope was that doing so would convince him to side with the U.S. over Iran and to win goodwill in the Arab world more generally.In Egypt the Obama administration adopted a similar approach i.e. appeasing a tyrant with the intention of establishing a clear break with Bush’s pressure for democratic reforms and encourage a new perception of the U.S. as more open to the Arab and Muslim worlds. In the midst of an orgy of federal spending Obama cut funding for pro-democracy groups in Egypt and prioritized relations with Hosni Mubarak’s regime.At the same time however Obama began trying to rehabilitate the Muslim Brotherhood not because he wished to encourage a democratic process in Egypt that might include their participation but because he wished to appease Islamist sentiment in general. His administration refused for example to identify radical Islam as the source of terrorism and even redefined the term “war on terror” itself as “overseas contingency operations.”Therefore when the Arab Spring erupted in 2011 the Obama administration initially tried to argue that he was not a “dictator.” Then as media criticism began to mount Obama switched sides and backed Mubarak’s ouster all the while claiming that he had not in fact changed his policy. His previous efforts to rehabilitate the Muslim Brotherhood as a legitimate organization gave some amount–though not much–of legitimacy to that claim.Today in the aftermath of the Egyptian coup Obama’s foreign policy has lost even the pretense of principle. He is showing outrage at the Egyptian military’s treatment of the Muslim Brotherhood protestors cutting some aid and canceling joint military exercises (none of which he did in response to the Brotherhood’s own excesses when in power). Yet he refuses to call the coup itself a “coup” or to cut all aid to the Egyptian military.Meanwhile in Syria Obama is still refusing to do anything that might actually deter the regime from using banned weapons–such as imposing a no-fly zone for instance–while accelerating aid to the Syrian rebels who are dominated by anti-American jihadists. His policies are all half-measures and contradictions. Faced with the fact that his academic anti-colonialism has little real-world relevance he is just avoiding any real commitments.In fact the only real foreign policy priority of the Obama administration is to avoid being blamed for anything that could possibly go wrong. He concluded his remarks on Egypt last week by insisting: “We don’t take sides with any particular party or political figure. I know it’s tempting inside of Egypt to blame the United States or the West or some other outside actor for what’s gone wrong.” The buck stops…with Egypt he said. Not with me.That is not to say that the Middle East’s current problems are easy to resolve. Republicans and conservatives have had a tough time coming to a consensus about what should be done. The Arab world presents only bad options and worse options: a genocidal regime in Syria versus brutal jihadist groups; a military tyranny in Egypt versus radical Islamists with hegemonic ambitions. The dangerous temptation to withdraw is strong.The one point of agreement among conservatives–even the likes of Patrick Buchanan these days–is that the U.S. should primarily be concerned with shoring up Israel against common enemies such as Al Qaeda and Iran. In other words the best path might be to focus on the sole U.S. ally in the region. But the Obama administration has done the opposite pressuring Israel and giving Iran leeway despite continued frustration.It is arguable that the Bush administration had a similarly rudderless foreign policy when it took office in 2001 driven only by the desire to do the opposite of its predecessor. Yet it pulled together a new strategy–however flawed–after 9/11 when circumstances had changed. Obama has failed to learn from crisis–whether the Green Revolution in Iran in 2009 or the Arab Spring and its aftermath. “Not Bush” is a non-policy but a real failure.,1
484,"It's a sort of perfect political storm for the Republican base. And GOP politicians -- particularly those with an eye on bolstering their conservative bona fides in advance of contested primaries -- know it well.Story continues below advertisementTo wit:* In an op-ed in USA Today Florida Sen. Marco Rubio a leading contender for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination was critical of how the Obama Administration has handled the investigation to date. Wrote Rubio: ""Instead of ensuring that these terrible events are not repeated the White House and its allies seem more interested in accusing those seeking answers of playing politics than getting to the bottom of what happened that night.""Advertisement* Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul himself a likely 2016 candidate penned a piece in the Washington Times slamming former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for her role in the Benghazi attacks.

Lindsey Graham who is one of a handful of Republican incumbents targeted by conservatives for defeat in a 2014 GOP primary drew huge applause last weekend at the state GOP convention when he told the crowd ""hell no I'm not gonna let this go!"" in relation to the Benghazi investigation.The simple fact is that Republican base voters not only dislike President Obama but have a deep distrust of how his Administration handles virtually all of its business. Not only is Benghazi a confluence of both of those realities but it also involved Clinton who is widely regarded as the frontrunner to be the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016 if she decides to run.AdvertisementWhether Benghazi has staying power as an issue all the way until average voters start paying attention to the presidential race sometime in 2015 (or early 2016) is anyone's guess. And much depends on whether Republicans can use the accountability argument to raise broader questions about Obama's (and by inference Democrats') commitment to transparency and competence.",1
485,Michael Hirsh is the National Journal’s chief correspondent.The events surrounding the deaths of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans in Benghazi Libya on Sept. 11 2012 look dramatically different depending on your politics. Republicans tend to see a cover-up and a scandal. Democrats see an attempt to damage President Obama and former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton. A Pew poll suggests that the public is divided as well with 40 percent saying the administration has been dishonest 37 percent saying it has told the truth and 23 percent saying they’re not sure. Let’s assess what we do and don’t know.1. U.N. Ambassador Susan E. Rice gave a deliberately false account of the attack.This is ground zero in the alleged scandal. Conspiracy theorists contend the administration covered up evidence that Stevens was killed in an organized terrorist attack because Obama during the 2012 campaign claimed he had “decimated” al-Qaeda. On Sunday talk shows five days after the attack Rice gave interviews based on talking points supplied by U.S. intelligence agencies; she suggested that Stevens’s death resulted from “spontaneous” protests that spread from the U.S. Embassy in Cairo provoked by a movie trailer lampooning the prophet Muhammad.In response to charges of a cover-up the White House this past week released 100 pages of e-mails that show the State Department sought to remove references to possible links to Ansar al-Sharia an Islamist group tied to al-Qaeda and to earlier CIA warnings of extremist threats in Benghazi and eastern Libya.Was there a cover-up? It does appear White House spokesman Jay Carney wasn’t giving the full story when he said at a Nov. 28 briefing that the White House and State Department had made only a “single adjustment” to the talking points changing the word “consulate” to “diplomatic facility.” It is also possible that State wanted to tone down or remove passages that might cast the department or Clinton in a bad light.But the e-mails indicate as well that the White House and State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland were mainly concerned with prejudging an ongoing investigation by releasing classified information too soon. And there is little doubt that Rice’s taped remarks reflected the best intelligence assessment of the attacks at the time. As more information came in intelligence officials changed that assessment publicly. If the talking points were extensively edited after an interagency consultation that was fairly normal procedure especially when it came to deleting classified portions referring to specific groups. Rice did allow in her comments on TV that “extremist elements” might have taken part in the attack.Even now the FBI and other agencies are not certain who the culprits were. In that light the administration’s efforts to remove references to specific groups look more judicious than nefarious.2. A faster military response would have saved at least some of the four Americans.We will never know for sure. In congressional testimony Stevens’s former deputy Gregory Hicks said his request that the military send in F-16s and Special Operations troops as the attack was underway was refused. The Obama administration has responded that Hicks a career diplomat was no military expert. Gen. Martin Dempsey chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and former defense secretary Leon Panetta testified this year that a military rescue mission would not have been practical. Dempsey said it would have taken “up to 20 hours or so” to get F-16s to the site and he called them “the wrong tool for the job.”Former defense secretary Robert Gates delivered perhaps the most persuasive rebuttal to this myth. On CBS’s “Face the Nation” on May 12 Gates said he probably would have made the same decisions. He also said Hicks’s notion that flying a fighter jet over the attackers might have dispersed them reflected “sort of a cartoonish impression of military capabilities” ignoring the “number of surface-to-air missiles that have disappeared from [former Libyan leader Moammar] Gaddafi’s arsenals.”3. Obama and Clinton should not be blamed.This is the Democrats’ favorite myth. In December Clinton’s own Accountability Review Board concluded that “systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies” might have contributed to the four deaths. But the report didn’t assign responsibility to any individual and it confined blame for any mistakes to “two bureaus of the State Department.”In fact the Obama administration did appear to be playing down or ignoring security threats in Libya at the time. As the report said: “Simply put in the months leading up to September 11 2012 security in Benghazi was not recognized and implemented as a ‘shared responsibility’ in Washington resulting in stove-piped discussions and decisions on policy and security.” The report also noted “known gaps” in the intelligence community’s assessments. And it’s the responsibility of those at the highest levels — the president and the secretary of state — to fill those gaps. In congressional testimony in January Clinton said that she didn’t read an Aug. 16 cable from Stevens that raised questions about security and that she didn’t know about a decision to reject a request for more security. “I didn’t see those requests. They did not come to me. I did not approve them. I did not deny them” she said. If so it’s fair to ask: Why wasn’t Clinton involved?4. The Benghazi attack could not have been predicted.The administration’s argument is that there was no specific threat — and it will probably be Clinton’s too if she reemerges in public life ahead of 2016. The circumstances were unusual. Stevens was taking extraordinary risks in traveling to Benghazi where he established contacts with anti-Gaddafi rebels during the uprising. Few U.S. ambassadors would ever be in a similar situation.But these risks were known before the attack. As the Accountability Review Board report concluded “At the time of the September attacks Benghazi remained a lawless town nominally controlled by the Supreme Security Council (SSC) — a coalition of militia elements loosely cobbled into a single force to provide interim security — but in reality run by a diverse group of local Islamist militias.” Why was Stevens allowed to travel to such an unsecure place?5. Benghazi is a pseudo-scandal manufactured by the GOP.Republicans have blown Benghazi out of proportion. It doesn’t appear to have been a cover-up but neither can it be dismissed. It represents a tragic failure of U.S. policy one that should spark a larger discussion about whether the government has responded poorly to the Islamist threats that have emerged since the Arab Spring. It is reasonable to ask whether the Obama administration starting with the president himself created the conditions for Benghazi by being overconfident about the destruction of al-Qaeda and playing down the significance of extremist elements possibly linked to al-Qaeda that had emerged in Libya and elsewhere. Unless these threats are better understood it is easy to imagine a similar disaster happening elsewhere.Because Benghazi cost precious American lives it should be investigated carefully rather than politicized endlessly.mhirsh@nationaljournal.comRead more from Outlook:Five myths about the Arab SpringHow to prevent the next BenghaziFriend us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.,1
486,Though Syria and Israel have technically been at war for more than 40 years the conflict in Syria is now viewed mainly through the prism of Iran. A prolonged conflict is perceived as hurting Iran which finances Mr. Assad’s war effort. Whether Mr. Obama follows through on his promise to retaliate for the use of chemical weapons is a test of his commitment ultimately to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb — as long as the retaliation does not become a full-scale intervention in Syria.“If it’s Iran-first policy then any diversion to Syria is not fruitful” said Aluf Benn editor of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. “From the Israeli point of view the worst scenario is mission-creep in Syria and America gets entangled in a third war in the Middle East which paralyzes its ability to strike Iran and limits Israel’s ability to strike Iran as well.”This spring when an Israeli official called for an international response to what he said were earlier Syrian chemical attacks he was muzzled and reprimanded for appearing to pressure the White House. Now said Eyal Zisser a historian at Tel Aviv University who specializes in the region “it’s clear that Israel does not want to appear as somebody that is pushing the United States for a deep involvement.”There are significant differences between Israel and the United States on Syria. There was widespread criticism here of Mr. Obama’s decision to delay responding to the chemical attack with the quote “When you have to shoot shoot don’t talk” from “The Good the Bad and the Ugly” becoming a common refrain. One Israeli dentist even took out a large newspaper ad promoting his implant services with a picture of Mr. Obama captioned “He doesn’t have teeth?”There has also been a broader debate about how best to respond to the war in Syria.When the uprising began many here saw Mr. Assad who like his predecessor and father had maintained quiet on the border as “the devil you know” and therefore preferable to the rebels some of whom were aligned with Al Qaeda or Sunni militants like the Palestinian Hamas faction.As the death toll has mounted more Israelis joined a camp led by Amos Yadlin a former head of Israeli military intelligence who argues that the devil you know is actually a devil who should be ousted sooner rather than later.That split remains. But as hopes have dimmed for the emergence of a moderate secular rebel force that might forge democratic change and even constructive dialogue with Israel a third approach has gained traction: Let the bad guys burn themselves out.,1
487,John Kerry was making his “beyond a reasonable doubt” case against Syria’s Bashar al-Assad on Wednesday when he gave lawmakers a bit of faulty intelligence.“Just today before coming in here I read an e-mail to me about a general the minister of defense former minister or assistant minister I forget which who has just defected and is now in Turkey” the secretary of state testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “And there are other defections that we are hearing about because of the potential that we might take action.”A few minutes later Kerry revised his account: This official-sounding “e-mail” was actually a Reuters news account about a former defense minister based on a claim by the Syrian opposition. “Reuters has now said the Syrian government is saying the defection has not taken place” Kerry said. “So who knows whether it has or hasn’t?”Who knows?This is the problem with the case the Obama administration is making for attacking Syria.1 of 33 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles on revolution in the Middle East View Photos Toles’s take on the situation in Libya Egypt and beyond.

Lawmakers emerging from secret classified briefings seem to agree. But while members of Congress are coming around to an attack on Syria the American public remains skeptical. Why? Maybe it’s because the government won’t let them in on the secret.The public heard about another “slam dunk” case a decade ago and then as now Democratic and Republican lawmakers agreed that the secret evidence was compelling. And it turned out to be wrong. Now administration officials are telling Americans to trust their assurances that the secret evidence is convincing and that their war planning is solid. But they won’t provide details.Estimates of collateral damage? “Lower than a certain number which I would rather share with you in a classified setting” Joint Chiefs Chairman Martin Dempsey told lawmakers.Response of the Arab and Muslim countries? “This is something I’d be happier discussing in greater detail with you in the closed session” Kerry said.Safeguards to keep military action limited? “We can talk about that in a closed session” Dempsey said.How would Russia and other Syrian allies respond to a U.S. strike? “We all agree that that would be best handled in a classified session” Kerry said.No we don’t all agree.Ann Telnaes animation: As Syria debate goes on the familiar drumbeat of war. (Ann Telnaes/The Washington Post)The administration’s case against Assad may well be airtight. Walter Pincus The Post’s longtime intelligence correspondent tells me he hasn’t heard the sort of doubts from the intelligence community that he heard during the run-up to the Iraq war. The problem is that the refusal to declassify evidence helps opponents such as Russia’s Vladimir Putin cast doubt on the intelligence. The administration is hiding behind the protection of “sources and methods” but is any foe still unaware of the National Security Agency’s satellite and intercept capabilities?Pincus argues for releasing the intercepts that describe the Syrian regime using the weapons and then ending the barrage and the satellite imagery showing preparations for an attack and the firing of rockets from Assad-controlled territory. But instead of declassifying administration officials are being ostentatious about their secrecy as if protecting their club’s secret handshake.“TOP SECRET/CLOSED” said the Senate Foreign Relations Committee’s notice for Wednesday’s hearing. “CLOSED” said the Senate Armed Services Committee’s notice. In “open” testimony Tuesday and Wednesday the officials encouraged lawmakers to save their questions for secret sessions.Arming the Syrian opposition? That “would require a closed or classified hearing.” The broad effects of the military strike? “I would prefer to speak out in a classified setting.” Could Hezbollah have chemical weapons? “We need to talk about that in our classified session.” Would allies join an attack? It “would not be appropriate to speak about in an unclassified setting.” Could an attack make Assad use chemical weapons again? “I urge you to go to the classified briefing.”At Wednesday’s hearing Kerry said that “beyond a reasonable doubt the evidence proves that the Assad regime prepared this attack.” He then dangled this: “In an appropriate setting you will learn additional evidence which came to us even today.”But isn’t it “appropriate” for the American public to see some hard evidence? During Tuesday’s Senate hearing Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) asked for the administration to “declassify a higher percentage of the information that we have so the American people and the international community can see it.”Kerry said that the amount declassified is “unprecedented” and that what’s out there now is “sufficient.”He may think so. But it’s not sufficient until the American public believes it.Twitter: @MilbankRead more from Dana Milbank’s archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.,1
488,"By Walter ShapiroMost second-term presidents become fixated on global affairs because the world beyond our shores with all its strife and misery often seems more malleable than life in Washington with its fractious Congress and waning electoral mandate. The trick though for a foreign policy president is to be good at it—and these days those skills appear to be eluding Barack Obama.This week’s biggest rebuke to Obama foreign policy was not Wednesday’s House hearing on Benghazi with its wrenching narrative of the September night that Ambassador Chris Stevens was killed in Libya. Nor was it Friday morning’s revelation of new Benghazi-related documents. More embarrassing was a front-page article in last Sunday’s New York Times detailing how Obama erred last August when he impetuously declared that Syria’s use of chemical weapons in its civil war would be a “red line.”It’s a simple rule: Presidents should never make threats until they have worked out how they would enforce them. But Obama violated it with his stern but ill-considered warning to Syrian strongman Bashar Assad. The Times article quotes one anonymous top government official claiming “What Obama said in August was unscripted” and “nuance got completely dropped.” Barry Pavel a former national security adviser to Obama said flatly “I’m not convinced it was thought through.”Current and former foreign policy advisers usually fall on their swords to protect a president’s reputation for sagacity. Only long afterward when the “if only he had listened to me” memoirs are published do we finally get a glimpse of what really happened in the White House. That’s why it’s telling that Obama insiders are already willing to trash the president for his all-bluster “red line” rhetoric.The reason for the finger-pointing at Obama is that America is now caught in a loose-lips-create-slips dilemma. Without any good policy options available and a growing isolationist mood among voters Obama must decide what to do in response to highly probable evidence that forces loyal to Assad used banned chemical weapons. Arming the rebels many of whom are Islamic militants carries its own risk yet doing nothing makes America appear feckless and irresolute.Playing for time Obama has been reduced to linguistic hair-splitting. Asked at a Tuesday press conference about perceptions that Syria has crossed his supposed red line Obama said lamely “I don't make decisions based on ‘perceived.’ And I can't organize international coalitions around ‘perceived.’ We've tried that in the past by the way and it didn't work out well.”That of course was a reference to George W. Bush and his fallacious weapons-of-mass-destruction pretext for the Iraq War. As a presidential candidate Obama presented himself as the antithesis of this kind of shoot-first foreign policy impetuousness. But as president it’s startling how much Obama resembles Bush in many aspects of national security policy.Take Guantanamo where currently about 100 of the remaining detainees are waging a hunger strike. Asked at a recent press conference about the Bush-era Cuban detention camp that he has repeatedly vowed to close Obama sounded more like an outside critic than a president: “It hurts us in terms of international standing. … It is a recruitment tool for extremists. It needs to be closed.”Despite intermittant efforts by Obama since taking office Congress has refused to allow the president to close Guantanamo. But that does not make Obama a helpless bystander with no control over this symbolic blot on America’s international reputation.The president has refused to use his existing legal authority (using waivers from the Defense Department) to repatriate 86 low-risk detainees mostly from Yemen whose cases have been reviewed by American authorities. Some of these prisoners were rank-and-file al-Qaida soldiers back in 2001 and others were probably picked up by mistake. But today these detainees would be less of a threat sent back to their home countries then they are as enduring symbols of an American gulag on Guantanamo.Then there are the drones. Bush may have initiated the airborne assassination program in 2004 but Obama has made it a hallmark of his response to terrorism. With his drone policy Obama has embraced three of the worst aspects of Bush-era national security policy: an obsession with secrecy; a contorted view of legal norms especially the definition of “imminent threat”; and a refusal to consider that American tactics may create more terrorists than they kill. In Pakistan alone based on the best independent statistics Obama has ordered six times as many drone strikes as ever Bush did.The silence from most Democrats on these troubling aspects of Obama foreign policy has been dispiriting. Had Bush made toothless threats to Syria force-fed prisoners in Guantanamo or rained death from the air in Pakistan on a weekly basis liberals in Congress would be sputtering with outrage. Instead with a few conspicuous exceptions—like Oregon Senator Ron Wyden on drones—the dominant feeling appears to be that if Obama does it it has to be right.Ever since George McGovern lost 49 states to Richard Nixon in 1972 Democrats have cowered in terror at the thought of being branded as soft on national security. This may partly explain Obama’s timorousness on Guantanamo and the president’s embrace of drone strikes as a way of being tough against terrorists without risking American casualties.The Republican obsession with Benghazi is rooted in the belief that the Obama administration was reluctant to label the 2012 Libyan attacks as “terrorism” because that would undermine the president’s narrative in an election year. Wednesday’s hearing—built around the testimony of three mid-level State Department officials—failed to prove anything close to causation. On Friday morning however ABC News reported that the State Department had insisted references to prior warnings on terrorism should be airbrushed out of the initial CIA talking points on the Banghazi attack.This was the briefing document that U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice who drew the short straw as the administration’s TV talker relied on when she made the rounds of Sunday-morning interviews the week of the attacks. Now based on the ABC News story it seems clear that Victoria Nuland a career foreign service officer who was Hillary Clinton’s spokesperson at State had insisted to the White House that these talking points be watered down.Even now so much about Benghazi remains murky including how big a scandal it will actually prove to be. Were Nuland’s editing suggestions primarily designed to politically protect Obama and Clinton? Or was this at its core a Washington bureaucratic battle over which agency should be blamed for the deaths in Libya—State or the CIA?Security was obviously lax in Benghazi. But was that because Stevens was a fearless diplomat who hated hunkering down behind concrete walls? Or was this related to the CIA’s still-mysterious role on the ground in Benghazi? And did the administration’s self-congratulatory belief in the Libyan revolution play a role in the relaxation of vigilence? Remember Libya was Obama’s success story from the ""Arab spring""—the nation where a dictator was toppled by America boldly leading from behind.Despite the documents discovered by ABC News my guess is that the tragedy in Benghazi and its muddled aftermath had far more to do with human error than major-league conspiracy. In fact given the way that Obama has handled his “red line” in Syria the case for human error seems quite compelling.",1
489,As the Egyptian military effectively declared a coup overthrowing the elected government of repressive Muslim Brotherhood President Mohammed Morsi the Obama administration struggled to come up with a coherent strategy to deal with the situation.President Obama released a statement on Morsi’s ouster suggesting that his administration “does not support particular individuals or political parties but we are committed to the democratic process and respect for the law.” With those principles in mind Obama declared himself “deeply concerned” and called for a transition to civilian rule. He refused to state whether the United States would withdraw aid to Egypt saying only that he had directed a comprehensive review process.Simultaneously the State Department which issued a mandatory evacuation order to non-essential personnel on Wednesday said it would not take sides in the Egyptian situation. “We haven’t taken sides and don’t plan to take sides here” said State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki.In an embarrassing signifier of the level of chaos plaguing the administration Secretary of State John Kerry called into the top level meetings from a secure phone. According to CBS producer Mosheh Oinounou Kerry was on the “Isabel” on Wednesday afternoon. Oinounou said that when another CBS producer yelled “Morsi!” to Kerry she received no response. Oinounou tweeted this photo:Later Oinounou reported that the State Department denies his claim that CBS reporters saw Kerry aboard his yacht; the State Department maintains that Kerry has been working on Egypt “all day.”Whether Kerry was working all day or not on the strategy it’s clear that confusion reigns at the highest levels. President Obama in Cairo in 2009 decried the “overthrow of a democratically-elected Iranian government” in the 1950s; when Honduras’ military ousted a would-be dictator the Obama administration originally kicked back before caving. Now it seems that the administration can’t label the military coup a military coup and won’t label it a democratic movement.President Obama isn’t even leading from behind at this point simply because he can’t tell which direction is behind.NOTE: This post has been edited to reflect the State Department’s denial of the original CBS report regarding Kerry’s presence on his yacht.Ben Shapiro is Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News and author of the New York Times bestseller “Bullies: How the Left’s Culture of Fear and Intimidation Silences America” (Threshold Editions January 8 2013).,1
490,Story highlights Hillary Clinton testifies for more than five hours before two congressional committees Clinton at one point grew exasperated with line of questioning over Benghazi response Some Republican lawmakers say they are not satisfied with Clinton's answers Four Americans killed in September 11 attack including U.S. ambassador to LibyaSecretary of State Hillary Clinton on Wednesday took on Republican congressional critics of her department’s handling of the deadly September terrorist attack in Libya.Conservative GOP members challenged Clinton on the lack of security at the diplomatic compound in Benghazi as well as the erroneous account that the attack grew spontaneously from a protest over an anti-Islam film produced in the United States.At two hearings which together totaled more than five hours Clinton acknowledged a “systemic breakdown” cited by an independent review of issues leading up to the armed assault and said her department was taking additional steps to increase security at U.S. diplomatic facilities.Here are five things we learned from the hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations and House Foreign Affairs committees.Read more: Clinton takes on Benghazi critics1. What Clinton did the day of the Benghazi attackClinton spent the better part of last September 11 trying to get a handle on security at several other U.S. embassies in the Middle East where anti-American protests were in full swing over an anti-Muslim film produced in the United States.She said the U.S. embassy was “under assault” by crowds trying to scale the wall. American embassies in Yemen and Tunisia were also facing a “serious threat. Clinton personally called the president of Tunisia she said to “beg him to send reinforcements which he did to finally save our embassy.”By 4 p.m. that day Clinton was notified about the Benghazi attack. In the coming hours she was in meetings and spoke with staff the American Embassy in Tripoli and other U.S. officials.Directing the U.S. response from the State Department Clinton stayed in touch with officials across the administration and with the Libyan government.She instructed her staff to “consider every option to just break down the doors of the Libyan officials to get as much security support as we possibly could.”Clinton said in the hours and days following the attack in Benghazi there were “no delays in decision-making. No denials of support from Washington or from our military” something an independent board established to review the matter cited in its report.#whatdifferencedoesitmake: Clinton quote goes viral on Twitter2. U.S. diplomatic posts in some 20 countries under threatClinton said threats to U.S. diplomatic posts are ongoing.“Sitting here today we probably have at least 20 other posts that are under a serious threat environment as I speak to you” she told senators. “We operate in places where we know that our facilities are being surveilled for potential attacks where we have a steady Intel stream of plotting.”Clinton detailed what the State Department has done to begin implementing the 29 recommendations of the Accountability Review Board to improve security at diplomatic posts in high-threat areas in addition to a few of her own.Opinion: Benghazi blame game is uselessSpecifically Clinton has appointed a team led by her deputy to focus on tightening security sent joint teams of military special forces and diplomatic security threat analysts to more than a dozen high-risk posts and appointed a senior official to focus exclusively on those areas.The State Department is also working to streamline requests for security so they make their way more quickly up the chain of leadership.Despite the threat Clinton stressed the importance of U.S. leadership and diplomatic presence in the Middle East.“We’ve come a long way in the past four years and we cannot afford to retreat now” Clinton told senators. “When America is absent especially from unstable environments there are consequences. Extremism takes root our interests suffer our security at home is threatened.”Read more: Pentagon releases official timeline of Benghazi attack3. Clinton not shying away from a fightClinton grew emotional and held back tears when talking about U.S. personnel killed in the Benghazi attack.“For me this is not just a matter of policy it’s personal. I stood next to President Obama as the Marines carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews” Clinton said as she choked back tears. “I put my arms around the mothers and fathers the sisters and brothers the sons and daughters and the wives left alone to raise their children.”But she lost patience with the focus of Republican senators on talking points used by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice on the next Sunday’s talk shows that focused on a protest at the U.S. post in Benghazi which turned out not to have taken place.Opinion: Rand Paul vs. Hillary Clinton clash of titansWhen Sen. Ron Johnson pressed Clinton on why the State Department didn’t call U.S. personnel who were evacuated from Benghazi to determine whether there was a protest Clinton took him to task.“With all due respect the fact is we had four dead Americans” Clinton reminded Johnson as she banged her hand on the table.“Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided they’d go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening” she said.Photos: Hillary Clinton through the years4. Militants in Mali and Algeria have arms from LibyaClinton warned the security situation in northern Mali where international forces are battling militants has been exacerbated by flow of weapons from neighboring Libya following the fall of Moammar Gadhafi.She said there was “no doubt” such weapons were also used in an attack by militants on an Algerian natural gas plant last week.She noted the aftermath of the Arab spring has changed power dynamics and stretched security forces across the region thin.Calling the campaign struggle against the Islamic fighters a necessary response to “a very serious ongoing threat” Clinton said the “United States cannot permit northern Mali to become a safe-haven for Islamist rebels that could eventually pose a more direct threat to U.S. interests.”Noting the increased strength of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb the regional affiliate of the al Qaeda network fighting along side local Malians Clinton warned that the United States must prepare for the possibility that groups like AQIM could threaten direct attacks on U.S. interests as they gain power.“You can’t say because they haven’t done something they’re not going to do it” Clinton said. “This is not only a terrorist syndicate it is a criminal enterprise. So make no mistake about it we’ve got to have a better strategy.”Read more: Clinton lays out daunting security challenges in North Africa5. Republicans still aren’t buying itWhile their tone was generally respectful several Republican senators made clear they were unsatisfied with Clinton’s answers.Sen. John McCain R-Arizona one of the administration’s toughest critics since the Benghazi attack took Clinton to task for what he considered lackluster attention to the growing threat in Benghazi.McCain wanted to know why Clinton hadn’t read a cable from Ambassador Christopher Stevens warning that the mission in Benghazi could not survive a sustained assault.Sen. Rand Paul said it would have been an offense worthy of firing Clinton had he been president.McCain also blasted Clinton’s answers to questions about the administration’s claim that a protest had taken place in Benghazi.“The American people deserve to know answers and they certainly don’t deserve false answers” McCain told Clinton.Clinton was more diplomatic with her old friend saying she respected his strong feelings for the incident given his own relationship with Stevens but that they disagreed about what happened and when it happened with respect to explaining events.In addition to lessons the State Department learned about improving security at diplomatic posts Clinton who called the Benghazi attack an act of terrorism since Day One suggested the administration might learn another lesson.“Just withhold. Don’t say what you don’t know for sure until it’s finally decided.”Read more: Polls on Clinton’s side,0
491,"LOS ANGELES - President Obama wrapped up his Western swing with an appearance on NBC’s “Tonight Show.” In a wide-ranging interview with the late night talk show host Obama discussed recent terrorist threats Hillary Clinton the NSA controversy and whether the U.S. might boycott the 2014 Winter Olympic games in Russia.""The odds of dying in a terrorist attack are a lot lower than they are of dying in a car accident unfortunately"" Obama said when asked by Leno if it is still safe for Americans to travel abroad in light of recent heightened terrorist threats.Obama denied that the U.S. has a domestic spying program but said the work done by the National Security Agency (NSA) is a “critical component” in keeping the country safe from outside threats.""We don’t have a domestic spying program” he said. “What we do have is some mechanisms that can track a phone number or an email address that is connected to a terrorist attack. That information is useful.""However Obama did acknowledge that recent accusations of the government spying on average Americans has “raised a lot of questions for people.”In a lighter exchange Obama was asked about his lunch meeting with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Obama did not get into the specifics of the meeting with his former campaign rival but joked about Clinton's ""glow"" since leaving government.""We had a great time and she had that post-administration glow"" Obama told Leno. ""When folks leave the White House like two weeks later they look great!""Obama also had kind words for another former rival John McCain.When Leno asked Obama about his blossoming ""bromance"" with the Arizona Republican Obama joked ""That's how classic romantic comedies go."" He went on to say ""He is a person of integrity. He is willing to say things regardless of the politics ... It's probably not good for me to compliment him on television.""Leno was also asked about former NSA contractor Edward Snowden who has recently received a one year asylum in Russia after leaking classified information about U.S. intelligence programs.Story continues""We don’t know exactly what he did except what he said on the Internet and it's important for me not to judge"" Obama said.However Obama did say that in light of the incident he has asked the White House staff to look at ways of reducing the number of contract employees employed by federal agencies.As to Russia’s decision to grant Snowden temporary asylum Obama said he did not think that or the recent controversy surrounding Russia’s stance on gay rights would deter the U.S. from participating in next year’s Winter Olympic games in Sochi Russia.""I think Putin and Russia have a big stake in making sure the Olympics work"" he said. ""I think they understand that for most of the countries that participate in the Olympics we wouldn't tolerate gays and lesbians being treated differently"" he said.",0
492,"Arabs don’t trust Obama either.As 2013 ends President Obama has lost credibility with many people who trusted him at the start of the year. Thanks to the Healthcare.gov debacle polls find support for the president among women and independents has dropped to the lowest ebb of his presidency. Obama's words -- promising Americans they could keep their doctors under his health care plan -- didn’t match his deeds.Surprisingly the same thing is happening on the other side of the world among Arabs in the Middle East and for the same reason.Too often Obama’s speeches and actions don’t match.""We are glad the Americans are here"" said Ahmed al-Ibrahim an adviser to some of Saudi Arabia's royals and officials when I met with him recently ""but we fear that the president has lost credibility after Syria.""More On This...[pullquote]The Saudi official is referring to Obama’s “red line” vow of military action if the Syrian dictator Bashir Assad used chemical weapons against his own people. Assad did and Obama didn’t. Saudi officials were stunned.Next came the revelation earlier this year that Obama was secretly negotiating with Iran the mortal enemy of both Israel and Saudi Arabia. Officials in both nations have told me that they simply don't believe that the president can sweet-talk the mullahs out of the weapons they have coveted for years.“The bond of trust between America and Saudi Arabia has been broken in the Obama years"" al-Ibrahim said. ""We feel we have been stabbed in the back by Obama.""""Every time that Obama had to choose between his enemies and his friends he always chose his enemies"" he said. ""We don't know what he's putting in his tea.""Al-Ibrahim also pointed to Obama's “dangerous inaction” during violent Iran-backed uprisings in Bahrain and now his negotiations with Iran and his separate secret negotiations with Iran's terrorist proxy Hezbollah. Since American officials cannot legally negotiate with terrorist groups and Hezbollah is a State Department-listed terror organization the administration has been using British diplomats to carry messages to Hezbollah. The Obama administration reportedly favors a ""warm up to a direct relationship in the future"" with Hezbollah.Obama is sending conflicting messages. In Washington the president says negotiations are all we need to meet the Iranian threat. He issued a rare veto threat to try to halt tougher sanctions against Iran.At the same time in the Middle East the president has dispatched more than 40 U.S. Navy vessels (including a carrier-strike group) and sent his secretary of defense to detail America's vast military assets in the region.Speaking to Arab defense ministers Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel itemized America's military commitment to immediately respond to Iranian aggression:• More than 35000 soldiers sailors airmen and Marines in the theater;• Even after exiting Iraq the U.S. Army maintains more than 10000 forward-deployed soldiers as well as tanks artillery and attack helicopters;• America's most advanced fighter jets including F-22s are deployed less than an hour's flight time from Iran;• American surveillance aircraft ground listening stations satellites and sea patrols continue to scan for threats across the region;• America's missile defense systems--on ground sea and air--remain on high alert. That includes the U.S. Navy's ballistic missile defense ships Patriot missile batteries and phased-array radars.“The Department of Defense will work with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) on better integration of its members’ missile defense capabilities. The United States continues to believe that a multilateral framework is the best way to develop interoperable and integrated regional missile defense. Such defenses are the best way to deter and if necessary defeat coercion and aggression"" Hagel told the Gulf News on Dec.18.With little fanfare Obama has also quietly lifted the ban on selling sensitive missile-defense technology to Saudi Arabia and other Arab allies living within reach of Iran's new Shahab-3 missiles. The Shahab-3's range is 1242 miles--placing Israel and most of America's Arab allies within striking distance.However Obama's quiet efforts to provide new missile defenses and renewed security guarantees may be too little too late.The Saudis are now seeking their own military arrangements because they no longer trust the U.S. The GCC a regional alliance of Bahrain Kuwait Oman Qatar Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates recently announced the creation of a joint military force based in the Saudi capital of Riyadh.“There will be a unified command of around 100000 members God willing” Prince Miteb bin Abdullah told reporters. This new force represents a massive expansion of the 30000-strong Peninsula Shield force.""We no longer believe that America alone can safeguard our freedom from Iranian aggression"" said al-Ibrahim ""that's why we are expanding our forces and integrating our missile defenses with our neighbors.""He added ""the world should understand that the GCC will not stay quiet and leave our member-states vulnerable to bad actors and bad deals in the region. It is our duty to protect our region.""And now astonished Saudi officials are contrasting Obama's quick actions last weekend in South Sudan with his unwillingness to act in places like Syria or in Bahrain where thousands of U.S. troops and the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet are based.""The president has shown that he can take action when he chooses to. He chose not to act after the chemical weapons attacks in Syria but as soon as things started to go wrong in South Sudan Obama jumped on it"" said al-Ibrahim.On Saturday Obama dispatched three CV-22 Osprey aircraft the sort that can fly like an airplane and an helicopter to South Sudan to evacuate Americans caught in ongoing violence in the city of Bor. The aircraft came under small arms fire and were forced to retreat as they attempted to land. Four U.S. service members were injured in the attempted evacuation. American citizens were rescued successfully on Sunday using civilian and U.N. helicopters.In his June 4 2009 Cairo speech the first American president raised in a Muslim land came to offer a bold promise: ""I have come here to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world; one based upon mutual interest and mutual respect."" Four and a half years later Arab leaders like al-Ibrahim say that ""mutual interest"" is sundered and ""mutual respect"" squandered.If the Saudi exasperation sounds familiar it is because it is the same tone you hear in Tel Aviv and in Washington.",1
493,Riyadh's decision this month not to take up its seat on the UN Security Council was intended to send a message to the US not the UN. Jordan and the United Arab Emirates have similar misgivings over the president's failure to intervene more strongly in Syria's civil war.,1
494,"""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" Sundays at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. ET on CNNBy Fareed ZakariaLast March President Barack Obama spoke about how Syria’s use of chemical weapons would be a “game-changer.” It has except not quite in the sense that he meant. It has been an event that has confused and confounded the Obama administration. Whatever your views on the larger issues it’s hard not to conclude that the administration’s handling of Syria over the last year has been a case study in how not to do foreign policy.The president started out with an understanding that the Syrian conflict is a messy sectarian struggle that cannot be influenced easily by American military intervention. He was disciplined in resisting calls to jump into a cauldron. But from the start he confused and undermined this policy with loose rhetoric perhaps egged on by some of his advisors and critics to ""do something.""So he announced just over two years ago that President Bashar al-Assad of Syria had to go. Now a pundit can engage in grandiose speech. The president of the United States should make declarations like this only if he has some strategy to actually achieve them. He did not.More from CNN: Signs of sarin use Kerry saysIn truth Obama – and many others – miscalculated. They believed that al-Assad’s regime was near the end misreading both its strength and brutality but also the level of support it has from several segments of Syria.Then just about a year ago came the off-the-cuff remarks about a red line on chemical weapons insufficiently thought through but now publicly stated and definitive. Since then American foreign policy in Syria has largely been concerned about ensuring that Obama’s threat does not seem empty. It has been a complicated dance.But what American national interest is being followed? The administration says it is upholding international law. Except as Fred Kaplan pointed out in Slate this week the institutions that embody international law and consensus – the United Nations and other international organizations – do not support this action. The United States plus France and Turkey cannot be considered the embodiment of international law and global public opinion.More from GPS: Does public care about U.N. blessing?The nature of the strike we are told will be short and symbolic – a shot across the bow. In the midst of a civil war in which both sides are in a high-stakes struggle for survival does anyone think that this will make any difference?And then the strangest twist – an unplanned last minute appeal to Congress paving the way for further delay weakening momentum erasing what little surprise existed and setting the stage for a potential defeat at home.I don’t think that this strike should it eventually take place will be as damaging as its critics fear. The al-Assad regime will likely hunker down take it and move on. It will make little difference one way or the other. But the manner in which the Obama administration has first created and then mismanaged this crisis will alas cast a long shadow on America’s role in the world.",1
495,"As the Obama administration moves ever-closer to a possible military strike on Syria members of Congress are demanding they at least have a say in the decision -- with some pressuring President Obama to first seek their approval.It's unclear whether the demands would slow down the administration as it begins to build the public case for a military strike. One Defense official told Fox News that a U.S. strike is ""not a matter of if but when.""White House Press Secretary Jay Carney stressed Tuesday afternoon that the president has not yet decided to authorize the use of military force. But he made a legal argument for doing so saying that the United States and 188 other nations are signatories to a chemical weapons convention opposing the use of such weapons and that there must be a response to a clear violation of those terms.While officials had indicated the intelligence documents implicating the Assad regime might be released as early as Tuesday the administration has not yet made them public.The quickly moving developments in response to an alleged chemical weapons strike by the Assad regime last week have lawmakers -- currently on summer recess -- clamoring for influence in a decision that has wide-ranging implications for both the Syrian civil war and the U.S. itself.Republican Rep. Scott Rigell of Virginia is asking colleagues to sign a letter to Obama that urges him to reconvene Congress and seek approval first for any military action.Other lawmakers are stopping short of demanding a vote but still want the administration to bring them into the process before moving ahead.""I expect the Commander in Chief would consult with Congress in the days ahead as he considers the options available to him"" Rep. Buck McKeon chairman of the House Armed Services Committee R-Calif. said in a statement while urging the administration to ""act decisively.""Sen. John Cornyn R-Texas on Tuesday urged the administration to submit a ""detailed plan"" on the objectives and cost of any strike.After House Speaker John Boehner's office complained that the White House had not been in touch a White House official reached out to Boehner Monday afternoon to discuss the Syria situation.Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said the speaker too ""made clear that before any action is taken there must be meaningful consultation with members of Congress as well as clearly defined objectives and a broader strategy to achieve stability.""Likewise Sen. Tim Kaine D-Va. said: ""Absent an imminent threat to United States national security the U.S. should not be engaged in military action without congressional approval.""Secretary of State John Kerry has been reaching out to Congress on the sidelines.Lawmakers in urging the administration to consult with them point in part to the War Powers Resolution of 1973. The resolution technically requires the president to seek congressional authorization when the military is sent into ""hostilities"" for anything but a retaliatory attack or formally declared war. But presidents have routinely flouted or found ways around that resolution -- the resolution for instance did not stop Obama from teaming up with Britain and France for airstrikes in Libya against Muammar Qaddafi's government.The Obama administration seems to be waiting for top allies -- like Britain and France -- to get on board before advancing with any plans to attack Syria.In Britain Prime Minister David Cameron has called back Parliament to debate and vote on a Syria plan on Thursday. And in France President Francois Hollande on Tuesday said France ""is ready to punish"" those who gassed hundreds in Syria.In Washington some members of Congress have long been opposed to intervention in Syria. But a number of high-ranking officials are speaking out in favor of a limited strike. Sen. Bill Nelson D-Fla. was the latest to say a multinational military action would be ""appropriate""Polls over the past year have shown the public is far less interested in getting more deeply involved in Syria. A Fox News poll in July found only 11 percent of voters favored sending weapons to the opposition. Forty-four percent said the U.S. should get out of the conflict entirely.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",1

497,WASHINGTON — Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) pressed Sunday for a special congressional committee to investigate the deadly attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi Libya last year insisting that questions about former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton’s role remain unanswered.“I don’t know what level of scandal unquote this rises to but I know it rises to the level where it requires a full and complete ventilation of these facts” McCain said on ABC’s “This Week.” “We’re still uncovering information which frankly contradicts the original line that the administration took.”AdvertisementHis comments came after the disclosure that administration emails on talking points about the deadly attack showed that the original CIA document underwent several revisions including one pushed by the State Department to delete a reference to warnings about the terrorist threat around the facility.PHOTOS: The controversy over BenghaziAdvertisementMcCain along with Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) first called for such a special panel on Benghazi last November. But the demand has gathered new backers this week since the emails appear to contradict initial claims by White House Spokesman Jay Carney that changes to the talking points in the days after the event were minor ones.At least 139 House members are now backing a plan by Rep. Frank R. Wolf (R-Va.) to name a special committee. House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) has so far resisted the appointment of a special panel arguing that multiple committees already looking into the attack can handle the job.AdvertisementThe head of a panel of retired diplomats and ex-military officers which investigated the attack said Sunday that there was no reason to conduct another probe into what happened at Benghazi and the U.S. response in the hours and days that followed.“I don’t see yet any reason why what we did at the accountability review board should be reopened” said retired Ambassador Thomas Pickering on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”AdvertisementHe noted that the panel had a narrow mandate to look at security arrangements at the facility. But he acknowledged that the panel had not questioned Clinton who was still secretary of State and other top State Department officials about their actions.“We didn’t believe that was necessary and I don’t see any reason to do so now” he said.AdvertisementInstead he said when they met with Clinton they briefed her on their findings.Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Vista) chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee said he has asked Pickering and retired Adm. Mike Mullen who co-chaired the investigation to answer questions after State Department officials criticized their review in hearings last week.AdvertisementMcCain said Clinton’s role was one issue still to be examined. “I think the secretary of State has played a role in this” he said. “She had to have been in the loop some way but we don’t know for sure.”Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) also appearing on “This Week” said there was “absolutely not” a coverup by the administration but acknowledged that the talking points became a “consensus document that avoided all of the difficult issues.”Advertisementdavid.cloud@latimes.com,1

499,House Republican leaders made the hearing the day’s top priority postponing floor votes so that the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform could continue without interruption. The Obama administration appeared focused on the testimony with senior officials at the White House the State Department and the Pentagon responding through the day to Republican accusations of incompetence and cover-up in campaign war room style.In the balance in the view of both Democrats and Republicans is not just the reputation of Mr. Obama but also potentially the prospects for the 2016 presidential election as well since Mrs. Clinton who stepped down in February is the Democratic Party’s leading prospect. If the testimony did not fundamentally challenge the facts and timeline of the Benghazi attack and the administration’s response to it it vividly illustrated the anxiety of top State Department officials about how the events would be publicly portrayed.Mr. Hicks offered an unbecoming view of political supervision and intimidation inside the Obama administration. When Representative Jason Chaffetz Republican of Utah visited Libya after the attack Mr. Hicks said his bosses told him not to talk to the congressman. When he did anyway and a State Department lawyer was excluded from one meeting because he lacked the necessary security clearance Mr. Hicks said he received an angry phone call from Mrs. Clinton’s chief of staff Cheryl Mills.“So this goes right to the person next to Secretary of State Clinton. Is that accurate?” asked Representative Jim Jordan Republican of Ohio. Mr. Hicks responded “Yes sir.”A State Department official said Mr. Hicks had been free to talk to Mr. Chaffetz but that department policy required a department lawyer to be present during interviews for any Congressional investigation.,1
500,Saturday morning Patrick Howley of The Daily Caller dropped another nuke on the fire that is Benghazi-Gate. Howley connects the dots surrounding a number of recent leaks coming of out CBS News about the fate of its award-winning investigative reporter Sharyl Attkisson.From the beginning Attkisson has been one of the few mainstream journalists willing to dig into the September 11 terror attack in Libya and the Administration’s response to it. Fearing the story might lead exactly where it did yesterday with Jonathan Karl’s bombshell report the mainstream media has poured most if its energy into wishing the story away or playing Palace Guard for the White House.Attkisson’s dogged pursuit of the truth has not only pitted her against a media desperate to protect Obama but also apparently against her bosses at CBS News one of whom is the brother of a top Obama official.Moreover CBS News president David Rhoades is not only the brother of President Obama’s national security advisor Ben Rhodes but ABC News reports that Ben Rhodes was very much involved in the editing of the now-infamous CIA talking points.So…1. According to ABC News Obama’s national security advisor Ben Rhodes was deeply involved in the editing of the CIA talking points.2. These same CIA talking points are central to what many believe is a White House coverup.3. Ben Rhodes is the brother of CBS News president David Rhodes.4. At CBS News Sharyl Attkisson is one of the only mainstream media journalists with the dogged determination and moral courage to demand the truth about the White House’s involvement in the CIA talking points.5. For months now reports have surfaced that Attkisson’s bosses are unhappy with her that she has trouble getting her Libya stories on the air and that she’s being accused of engaging in “advocacy.”Read the full Daily Caller piece here.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC,1
501,“Somebody finally said this has got to stop” said John D. Negroponte a former diplomat and director of national intelligence under George W. Bush. “Maybe if there are more prosecutions it will.”But critics argue that the Cartwright case and now the appeals court ruling show how the antileak campaign has gone too far producing a chilling effect on news gathering without deterring leakers. Mr. Snowden has said he was inspired by the deeds of Pfc. Bradley Manning who is facing a court-martial after divulging the diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks.“I think it has gotten away from them” said Morton H. Halperin who served in national security or diplomatic positions in three previous administrations. “If the president doesn’t fix this I think his claim that he understands the importance of balancing the First Amendment against claims of national security will lack any credibility.”Implicitly at least Mr. Holder seemed to acknowledge some of the criticism this month when he restored and bolstered longstanding Justice Department restraints on seeking evidence from journalists. He said those restrictions “will help ensure the proper balance is struck when pursuing investigations into unauthorized disclosures.”Mr. Holder’s move came in response to a torrent of criticism after the revelations this spring that prosecutors had secretly subpoenaed the phone logs for more than 20 phone lines of The Associated Press in one leak inquiry and two days of phone logs of a Fox News reporter James Rosen in another investigation aimed at a State Department adviser Stephen Jin-Woo Kim. Prosecutors also obtained a court-ordered search warrant for Mr. Rosen’s e-mails by identifying him as a criminal co-conspirator of Mr. Kim’s.But Mr. Holder’s conciliatory message was seemingly undermined by the Justice Department’s success in overturning a lower court’s ruling that a reporter for The New York Times James Risen had a First Amendment right to refuse to reveal his sources in the trial of a former C.I.A. analyst Jeffrey Sterling. Mr. Sterling was charged in 2010 with disclosing classified information to Mr. Risen about a covert operation to deceive Iranian scientists described in Mr. Risen’s 2006 book “State of War.”,1

The House Republicans release a scathing report blaming Hillary Clinton for something-something-Benghazi because something-something-Benghazi is the newest Fox News conspiracy theory and there's really just nothing and I mean nothing that the Congress of the United States of America needs to spend their time on more than Fox News conspiracy theories.

There's only one little problem with that: Clinton did not ""sign"" the letter. Darrell Issa and the rest of the Crack House Investigative Team of Superheroes got confused on a basic fact of how the State Department works and not one of them bothered to actually freaking check just once with the State Department as to their top-notch theory of things:[By tradition] every cable from an embassy bears the “signature” of the ambassador — and every cable from Washington bears the “signature” of the secretary of state. The protocol is explained in the State Department’s Foreign Affairs Manual: […] Because of this protocol “Secretary Clinton ‘signed’ hundreds of thousands of cables during her tenure as secretary” said State Department spokesman Patrick H. Ventrell. “As then-Secretary Clinton testified the security cables related to Benghazi did not come to her attention. These cables were reviewed at the assistant secretary level.”“The allegations in your staff report are false extremely irresponsible and lack even a rudimentary understanding of how State Department cables are processed” Cummings wrote in a letter to House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). […] “Although a telephone call could have clarified this issue in a matter of moments you chose not to check with the Department before making these highly inflammatory and erroneous accusations in a public forum.”Yep. The entire House Republican ""investigative"" team didn't know that and they didn't check and/or they didn't listen to Every Damn State Department Employee Who Could Tell Them That. Or as Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings puts it Has there ever been a Congress more incompetent than this one? I don't mean partisan or mean or ineffective—I mean stone-cold incompetent. This is the sort of thing that really should require a public pie in the face for all involved and the House Republican caucus is just goddamn stupid enough that we could probably get that required public pie-ing passed as actual bill providing we bury it in some language about continued oil subsidies or free guns to American toddlers.",0
503,"Authorities are investigating the man President Obama tapped to take over the second highest spot at the Department of Homeland Security for allegedly using his position and power to unfairly obtain U.S. visas for foreign investors in a company run by Hillary Clinton’s brother FoxNews.com has confirmed.Alejandro Mayorkas director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services was named by Homeland Security's Inspector General's Office as a target in an investigation involving the foreign investor program run by USCIS according to an email sent to lawmakers late Monday.The investigation was opened in September 2012 following a referral from an FBI counterintelligence analyst. The probe was first reported by The Associated Press.The investigation into Mayorkas is based on allegations he helped secure U.S. visas for Chinese businessmen after they had been denied by his own agency’s officials. The visas had been sought by Gulf Coast Funds Management a financing company headed by then-Secretary of State Clinton’s brother Anthony Rodham according to an aide to GOP Sen. Charles Grassley who had received internal USCIS emails about the matter from a department whistle-blower.According to an email sent to lawmakers Monday the IG's office said ""At this point in our investigation we do not have any findings of criminal misconduct."" The email did not specify any criminal allegations it might be investigating.White House press secretary Jay Carney referred questions to the inspector general's office which said that the probe is in its preliminary stage and that it doesn't comment on the specifics of investigations.The program known as EB-5 allows foreigners to get visas if they invest $500000 to $1 million in projects or businesses that create jobs for U.S. citizens. The amount of the investment required depends on the type of project. Investors who are approved for the program can become legal permanent residents after two years and can later be eligible to become citizens.If Mayorkas were confirmed as Homeland Security's deputy secretary he probably would run the department until a permanent replacement was approved to take over for departing Secretary Janet Napolitano.The email to lawmakers said the primary complaint against Mayorkas was that he helped a financing company run by Rodham to win approval for an investor visa even after the application was denied and an appeal was rejected.Mayorkas a former U.S. attorney in California previously came under criticism for his involvement in the commutation by President Bill Clinton of the prison sentence of the son of a Democratic Party donor.Another of Hillary Clinton's brothers Hugh Rodham had been hired by the donor to lobby for the commutation. Mayorkas told lawmakers during his 2009 confirmation hearing that ""it was a mistake"" to talk to the White House about the request.Hillary Clinton who stepped down as secretary of state on Feb. 1 is considered a possible contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016.According to the Inspector General's email the investigation of the investor visa program also includes allegations that other USCIS Office of General Counsel officials obstructed an audit of the visa program by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The email did not name any specific official from the general counsel's office.The email says investigators did not know whether Mayorkas was aware of the investigation.The FBI's Washington field office was told about the investigation in June after it inquired about Mayorkas as part of the White House background investigation for his nomination as deputy DHS secretary.The FBI in Washington has been concerned about the investor visa program and the projects funded by foreign sources since at least March according to emails obtained by The AP.The bureau wanted details of all of the limited liability companies that had invested in the EB-5 visa program. Of particular concern the FBI official wrote was Chinese investment in projects including the building of an FBI facility.""Let's just say that we have a significant issue that my higher-ups are really concerned about and this may be addressed way above my pay grade"" an official wrote in one email. The FBI official's name was redacted in that email.Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee sent the FBI a lengthy letter Tuesday asking for details of its review of the foreign investor visa program and Chinese investment in U.S. infrastructure projects.Chinese investment in infrastructure projects has long been a concern of the U.S. government. In September the Obama administration blocked a Chinese company from owning four wind farm projects in northern Oregon that were near a Navy base used to fly unmanned drones and electronic-warfare planes on training missions. In October the House Intelligence Committee warned that two leading Chinese technology firms Huawei Technologies Ltd. and ZTE Corp. posed a major security threat to the U.S. Both firms have denied being influenced by the Chinese government.The most routine users of the EB-5 program are Chinese investors.According to an undated unclassified State Department report about the program obtained by the AP the U.S. Consulate in Guangzhou China processed more investor visas in the 2011 fiscal year than any other consulate or embassy.The document says ""applicants are usually coached and prepped for their interviews making it difficult to take at face value applicants' claims"" about where their money comes from and whether they hold membership in the Chinese Communist Party. Party membership would make an applicant ineligible for the investor visa.Anthony Rodham is president and CEO of Gulf Coast Funds Management LLC in McLean Va. The firm is one of hundreds of ""Regional Centers"" that pool investments from foreign nationals looking to invest in U.S. businesses or industries as part of the foreign investor visa program.There was no immediate response to an email sent to Gulf Coast requesting comment.It is unclear from the IG's email why the investor visa application was denied. Visa requests can be denied for a number of reasons including a circumstance where an applicant has a criminal background or is considered a threat to national security or public safety.Fox News' Jana Winter and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",1
504,"On the night of Sept. 11 as the Obama administration scrambled to respond to the Benghazi terror attacks then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and a key aide effectively tried to cut the department's own counterterrorism bureau out of the chain of reporting and decision-making according to a ""whistle-blower"" witness from that bureau who will soon testify to the charge before Congress Fox News has learned.That witness is Mark I. Thompson a former Marine and now the deputy coordinator for operations in the agency’s counterterrorism bureau. Sources tell Fox News Thompson will level the allegation against Clinton during testimony on Wednesday before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee chaired by Rep. Darrell Issa R-Calif.Fox News has also learned that another official from the counterterrorism bureau -- independently of Thompson -- voiced the same complaint about Clinton and Under Secretary for Management Patrick Kennedy to trusted national security colleagues back in October.Extremists linked to Al Qaeda stormed the U.S. Consulate and a nearby annex on Sept. 11 in a heavily armed and well-coordinated eight-hour assault that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other Americans.Thompson considers himself a whistle-blower whose account was suppressed by the official investigative panel that Clinton convened to review the episode the Accountability Review Board (ARB). Thompson's lawyer Joseph diGenova a former U.S. attorney has further alleged that his client has been subjected to threats and intimidation by as-yet-unnamed superiors at State in advance of his cooperation with Congress.Sources close to the congressional investigation who have been briefed on what Thompson will testify tell Fox News the veteran counterterrorism official concluded on Sept. 11 that Clinton and Kennedy tried to cut the counterterrorism bureau out of the loop as they and other Obama administration officials weighed how to respond to -- and characterize -- the Benghazi attacks.""You should have seen what (Clinton) tried to do to us that night"" the second official in State's counterterrorism bureau told colleagues back in October. Those comments would appear to be corroborated by Thompson's forthcoming testimony.State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki called the counterterrorism officials' allegation ""100 percent false."" A spokesman for Clinton said tersely that the charge is not true.Daniel Benjamin who ran the department's Counterterrorism Bureau at the time also put out a statement Monday morning strongly denying the charges.""I ran the bureau then and I can say now with certainty as the former Coordinator for Counterterrorism that this charge is simply untrue"" he said. ""Though I was out of the country on official travel at the time of the attack I was in frequent contact with the Department. At no time did I feel that the Bureau was in any way being left out of deliberations that it should have been part of.""He went on to call his bureau a ""central participant in the interagency discussion about the longer-term response to Benghazi."" He said ""at no time was the Bureau sidelined or otherwise kept from carrying out its tasks.""Thompson's attorney diGenova would not comment for this article.Documents from the State Department the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Council first published in the May 13 edition of ""The Weekly Standard"" showed that senior officials from those agencies decided within days of the attacks to delete all references to Al Qaeda's known involvement in them from ""talking points"" being prepared for those administration officers being sent out to discuss the attacks publicly.Those talking points -- and indeed the statements of all senior Obama administration officials who commented publicly on Benghazi during the early days after the attacks -- sought instead to depict the Americans' deaths as the result of a spontaneous protest that went awry. The administration later acknowledged that there had been no such protest as evidence mounted that Al Qaeda-linked terrorists had participated in the attacks. The latter conclusion had figured prominently in the earliest CIA drafts of the talking points but was stricken by an ad hoc group of senior officials controlling the drafting process. Among those involved in prodding the deletions the documents published by ""The Weekly Standard"" show was State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland who wrote at one point that the revisions were not sufficient to satisfy ""my building's leadership.""The allegations of the two counterterrorism officials stand to return the former secretary of state to the center of the Benghazi story. Widely regarded as a leading potential candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 Clinton has insisted she was not privy to decisions made by underlings about the inadequate security for the U.S. installations in Benghazi that were made in the run-up to the attacks. And she has portrayed her role -- once the attacks became known in Washington -- as that of a determined fact-finder who worked with colleagues to fashion the best possible response to the crisis.Clinton testified about Benghazi for the first and only time in January of this year shortly before leaving office. She had long delayed her testimony at first because she cited the need for the ARB to complete its report and then because she suffered a series of untimely health problems that included a stomach virus a concussion sustained during a fall at home and a blood clot near her brain from which she has since recovered. However Clinton was never interviewed by the ARB she convened.Fox News disclosed last week that the conduct of the ARB is itself now under review by the State Department's Office of Inspector General. A department spokesman said the OIG probe is examining all prior ARBs not just the one established after Benghazi.The two U.S. officials -- former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mike Mullen and former Ambassador Tom Pickering -- who oversaw the internal review of the attacks defended their report.""From the beginning of the ARB process we had unfettered access to everyone and everything including all the documentation we needed. Our marching orders were to get to the bottom of what happened and that's what we did"" they said in a statement Monday.The counterterrorism officials however concluded that Clinton and Kennedy were immediately wary of the attacks being portrayed as acts of terrorism and accordingly worked to prevent the counterterrorism bureau from having a role in the department's early decision-making relating to them.Also appearing before the oversight committee on Wednesday will be Gregory N. Hicks the deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Libya at the time of the Benghazi terrorist attacks. Like Thompson Hicks is a career State Department official who considers himself a Benghazi whistle-blower. His attorney Victoria Toensing a former chief counsel to the Senate Intelligence Committee has charged that Hicks too has faced threats of reprisal from unnamed superiors at State. (Toensing and diGenova who are representing their respective clients pro bono are married.)Portions of the forthcoming testimony of Hicks -- who was one of the last people to speak to Stevens and who upon the ambassador's death became the senior U.S. diplomat in Libya -- were made public by Rep. Issa during an appearance on the CBS News program ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday.Hicks told the committee that he and his colleagues on the ground in Libya that night knew instantly that Benghazi was a terrorist attack and that he was astonished that no one drafting the administration's talking points consulted with him before finalizing them or before U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice delivered them on the Sunday talk shows of Sept. 16.Hicks was interviewed by the ARB but Thompson was not sources close to the committee's investigation tell Fox News.",1
505,"Stung by public unease about new details of spying by the National Security Agency President Barack Obama selected a panel of advisers he described as independent experts to scrutinize the NSA's surveillance programs to be sure they weren't violating civil liberties and to restore Americans' trust.But with just weeks remaining before its first deadline to report back to the White House the review panel has effectively been operating as an arm of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence which oversees the NSA and all other U.S. spy efforts.The panel's advisers work in offices on loan from the DNI. Interview requests and press statements from the review panel are carefully coordinated through the DNI's press office. James Clapper the intelligence director exempted the panel from U.S. rules that require federal committees to conduct their business and their meetings in ways the public can observe. Its final report when it's issued will be submitted for White House approval before the public can read it.Even the panel's official name suggests it's run by Clapper's office: ""Director of National Intelligence Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies.""Its meetings in recent weeks with technology industry and privacy groups have been closed to the public even though no classified information was discussed according to participants. Attendees told The Associated Press they raised concerns about the NSA's spying programs. During one session two participants said panel members said the group might hold a separate classified meeting soon with technology executives to discuss details of secret surveillance programs.""No one can look at this group and say it's completely independent"" said one attendee Sascha Meinrath director of the Open Technology Institute and vice president at the New America Foundation. Meinrath said the closed meetings ""leave the public out of the loop.""Obama described the panel an Aug. 9 speech as an ""independent group"" and said its members would ""consider how we can maintain the trust of the people how we can make sure that there absolutely is no abuse in terms of how these surveillance technologies are used.""The formal White House memorandum days later -- effectively the legal charter for the group -- does not specify anything about its role being independent of the Obama administration. It directed the panel to emphasize in its review whether U.S. spying programs protect national security advance foreign policy and are protected against the types of leaks that led to the national debate in the first place. The final consideration in the White House memo told the panel to examine ""our need to maintain the public trust."" There was no mention of the panel investigating surveillance abuses.The review panel in a statement released through the DNI's press office confirmed to the AP that Clapper had exempted it from the U.S. Federal Advisory Committee Act which requires such committees to conduct open meetings and notify the public about their activities. It said Clapper made the decision because of the ""highly classified nature of their review"" but added: ""We are conducting this review as openly and transparently as possible."" In private meetings so far several attendees said their discussions did not mention any classified activities and that the panel members steered them away from doing so.Four of the five review panel members previously worked for Democratic administrations: Peter Swire former Office of Management and Budget privacy director under President Bill Clinton; Michael Morell Obama's former deputy CIA director; Richard Clarke former counterterrorism coordinator under Clinton and later for President George W. Bush; and Cass Sunstein Obama's former regulatory czar. A fifth panel member Geoffrey Stone of the University of Chicago leads a university committee looking to build Obama's presidential library in Chicago and was an informal adviser to Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.Stone wrote in a July op-ed that the NSA surveillance program that collects the phone records of every American every day is constitutional.""We would have liked a more diverse group"" said Michelle Richardson an ACLU legislative counsel who attended one meeting for civil liberties groups.The review panel overlaps with a similar effort by a second advisory group. In July Obama asked the independent Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board to report on the NSA programs and their effects on civil liberties. While PCLOB's work is expected to take months and has no deadline Obama ordered the review group to report interim findings within 60 days and provide a final report by Dec. 15.'PCLOB chairman David Medine said recently that his group's purview was different because it was not subject to review by the White House. PCLOB's hearings so far have been conducted in public although the group has been given classified briefings by national security officials.""We're proceeding regardless of other groups' timelines"" Medine said.A spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council Caitlin Hayden said the review group and civil liberties board have separate mandates. She said the review panel is looking at spy programs authorized under the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the USA Patriot Act and references to the NSA collecting phone-records and obtaining copies of Internet messages from U.S. technology companies. The civil liberties board however is focusing on the same surveillance programs according to a June 2013 Congressional authorization letter.Obama has said in recent comments that he might be open to setting up public advocates who could oppose government lawyers at secret federal surveillance court proceedings -- similar to a proposal by Swire in 2004. But the administration has otherwise backed the surveillance programs as essential for national security.Participants in one session held for the technology industry included lawyers and other figures from Google Microsoft Yahoo Facebook and Apple -- firms that reportedly have worked with the NSA in surveillance operations. No phone company executives attended participants said. Technology executives pressed for more authority to tell computer users their private data is not being abused by the government said Robert Atkinson president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.Neither session according to participants gave any hint of changes under consideration.""Any time someone brought up what was at the heart of these issues"" Meinrath said ""we were told to put that into record on the website or else we were told it was classified.""",1
506,Rose: So I hear you saying I have no problem with what NSA has been doing.Obama: Well let me — let me finish because I don’t. So what happens is that the FBI — if in fact it now wants to get content; if in fact it wants to start tapping that phone — it’s got to go to the FISA court with probable cause and ask for a warrant.Rose: But has FISA court turned down any request?Obama: The — because — the — first of all Charlie the number of requests are surprisingly small… number one. Number two folks don’t go with a query unless they’ve got a pretty good suspicion.Rose: Should this be transparent in some way?Obama: It is transparent. That’s why we set up the FISA court.,1
507,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen. John McCain says he is disturbed the Obama administration has not been more forthcoming about an American who disappeared while on a secret intelligence mission to Iran.McCain said he is confident the U.S. is doing all it can to learn what has happened to Robert Levinson but he told CNN's ""State of the Union"" the CIA has not been forthcoming with the Congress about him. Iran's foreign minister meanwhile asserted that Levinson is ""not incarcerated by the government and I believe the government runs pretty much good control of the country.""An Associated Press investigation published last week found that Levinson was working for the CIA — investigating the Iranian government. The U.S. long has publicly described Levinson as a private citizen who traveled to an Iranian island on private business. McCain R-Ariz. told CNN ""the CIA did not tell the truth to the Congress"" about Levinson. He said he doesn't ""think there's any doubt"" about whether Iran knows Levinson's fate.But Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif when asked on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" where Levinson is replied: ""I have no idea.""""If we can trace him and find him we will certainly discuss"" returning him to the United States he said.Secretary of State John Kerry dismissed a suggestion by Levinson's family that the U.S. government was not doing enough to find out what happened to Levinson.""There hasn't been progress in the sense that we don't have him back. But to suggest that we have abandoned him or anybody has abandoned him is simply incorrect ... and not helpful"" Kerry told ABC's ""This Week.""""The fact is I have personally raised the issue not only at the highest level ... but also through other intermediaries"" said Kerry noting ""we have two other Americans that we're deeply concerned about.""Story continuesRight now ""we're looking for proof of life"" Kerry said.Iran's press counselor at the United Nations called on Washington to explain Levinson's mission in Iranian territory after the AP investigation revealed that he had been on an unauthorized assignment for the CIA when he vanished on Iran's Kish Island in March 2007.U.S. officials have raised the Levinson case with Iran repeatedly over the years. But until the AP investigation was published it was not widely known that Levinson was hoping to gather information in his role as an independent contract investigator who expected to be compensated by a group of analysts at the CIA.After he vanished the CIA at first told lawmakers he had previously done contract work for the agency but he had no current relationship with the agency and there was no connection to Iran. However in October 2007 Levinson's lawyer discovered emails in which Levinson told a CIA friend that he was working to develop a source with access to the Iranian government. The emails were turned over to the Senate Intelligence Committee which touched off an internal CIA investigation.Three veteran analysts were forced out of the CIA and seven others were disciplined as a result of a breach of agency rules.The last photos and video of a bearded emaciated Levinson were released anonymously to his family in 2010 and early 2011. Investigators say his trail has grown cold since then.",1
508,East Germany’s Ministry for State Security also known as the Stasi posed a major challenge during my three-year stint as an attache at the U.S. Embassy in Bonn during the 1960s. Detecting and preventing Stasi agents from penetrating the security of U.S. diplomatic facilities in West Germany was a 24-7 undertaking.The East German secret police were even more ruthless and relentless in operations against their own citizens. Political suppression in that communist state was total. There was no room for dissent. Thousands of East Germans were arbitrarily imprisoned for “internal security” reasons.So it was especially galling to learn upon returning to the states in 1969 that the FBI had a counterintelligence program known as COINTELPRO that was in some ways as pernicious as the threat we were working against overseas.Senate hearings in the 1970s revealed that the FBI under the guise of protecting national security had treated rights guaranteed by the First Amendment as little more than a collection of antiquated wishes best ignored.With its surveillance of citizens infiltration of civil rights groups and disruption of legal activities the FBI’s counterintelligence program echoed the behavior of East Germany’s Stasi. The FBI acknowledges on its Web site that “COINTELPRO was later rightfully criticized by Congress and the American people for abridging first amendment rights and for other reasons.”1 of 68 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Obama View Photos A collection of cartoons of the president. Caption A collection of cartoons of the president. Wait 1 second to continue.Fortunately Congress reined in the FBI placing it behind and not beyond the Constitution.Where are we now?The revelations that the Justice Department had secretly seized journalists’ phone records and that the Internal Revenue Service had targeted conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status show that government’s heavy hand has not been lifted. Are these examples of COINTELPRO revisited?Not quite though they are disturbing.Governments spend millions to prevent secrets from falling into enemy hands. A Justice Department probe into a compromised Middle East intelligence operation last year was not focused on the surreptitious work of a foreign power. The unlawful disclosure came from within.The Justice Department sought to discover who in the U.S. government allegedly told the Associated Press about a failed al-Qaeda plot in Yemen.The compromised Yemeni operation differs from some breakdowns in national security for its cause. Chalk up that serious breach to hubris: the leaker’s puerile chest-thumping about having bested a sworn enemy or worse a self-serving desire to burnish the Obama administration’s credentials as an al-Qaeda slayer.Ann Telnaes animation: John Boehner’s selective accountability (Ann Telnaes/The Washington Post)In this regard the administration has only itself to blame.On top of the mistakes made by a U.S. official leaking the nation’s secrets the administration compounded things by launching a dragnet for the records of calls received and made from 20 phone lines (including office home and cell numbers) of the AP journalists in five area codes and three states.Talk about power running amok.Meanwhile back in the bureaucracy Internal Revenue Service workers were having a high old time putting conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status through hoops. IRS employees were instructed to be on the “lookout” for groups with “tea party” and “patriot” in their names according to the report of the Treasury Department’s inspector general for tax administration.The acting IRS commissioner has already been forced to walk the plank and more heads may roll. The IRS has a steep hill to climb to gain the public’s trust. But there is one bright spot: This misbehavior was detected and exposed by government self-policing. Of course the selective screening never should have occurred. But the inspector general system created to ferret out government fraud waste and abuse worked in this case.The Justice Department meanwhile is in an even deeper hole.Who can take seriously the department’s mission as stated by its Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties “to protect the privacy and civil liberties of the American people”?Famed First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams told the Daily Beast this week that the Justice Department’s broad seizure of journalists’ phone records was “certainly one of the most intense intrusions by the government into a pressroom that I can remember.”“Why couldn’t they put this issue before a judge?” Abrams asked. “What they have done is foreclose any meaningful response by the AP. This isn’t just seeking a record of one journalist for one day. This is breaking and entering into the heart of the journalistic process of the Associated Press.”Media outlets covering D.C. affairs should also be concerned. Journalists who draw on confidential sources while aggressively covering the city’s corruption scandal may now wonder if U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen is going after their phone records. After all it was Machen’s office that served the subpoenas in the AP case.COINTELPRO? No. Unchecked government power? Yes.Read more from Colbert King’s archive.,1
509,Seven hundred retired Military Special Operations professionals from the organization “Special Operations Speaks” sent a letter to the House of Representatives urging members to support H.Res 36 which will create a House Select Committee to investigate last September’s deadly terrorist attack in Benghazi Libya.Congressman Frank Wolf (R-VA) a sub-committee chairman on the House Appropriations Committee issued a resolution for a House Select Committee to investigate issues surrounding the Benghazi Attack last November in the 112th Congress. He re-issued his resolution for the select committee when the 113th Congress began. The resolution currently has over 60 co-sponsors.Only Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) can appoint a Select Committee and Boehner appears to mainly rely on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to investigate the Benghazi attack. However any information that may be garnered from that committee will as always remain classified.“As a retired Special Operations officer who spent most of my thirty-six years preparing for and executing rescue missions to save fellow Americans I am deeply troubled by the events in Benghazi on September 11 2012. The men and women who I served with lived by an ethos that pledged to never leave a fallen comrade and to make every effort to respond when a fellow American was threatened. I have seen men take great risks to save a fellow warrior. I have even seen men die trying to do so” wrote General William G. ‘Jerry’ Boykin in a statement to Breitbart News.Boykin added “The lack of accountability regarding the Benghazi event disturbs me greatly and bears the earmarks of a cover up. America is entitled to a full accounting of this egregious attack on our people with some explanation as to why there was no effort to save the Americans in the US Embassy annex and the CIA station or at least to recover their bodies before they fell into Libyan hands. Our Congress has yet to fulfill its responsibility to provide a complete analysis of the attack or to provide answers as to what exactly happened. A bi-partisan Special Committee is needed to determine the truth about Benghazi.”Last month Rep. Wolf along with Rep. Jim Gerlach (R-PA) a House Ways and Means Committee member sent a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry demanding more informatio n on State Department employees who survived the Benghazi attack. In his letter to Kerry Wolf noted that sources say that as many as 30 survivors of the Benghazi attack were allegedly wounded. Seven of those thirty were said to be critical injuries. Sec. Kerry confirmed he visited an injured Benghazi survivor at Walter Reed.Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) Chairman of the House Oversight Committee pointed to Kerry’s admission as a reason why he expects to speak with Benghazi survivors. “Now that Secretary Kerry has publicly essentially a Senator in a post way has chosen to visit with them any claim that they’re not available at this point to Congress is unsupportable. And I look forward to oversight by all committees” Issa told Breitbart News.Since Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) first told Breitbart News in December that the Obama administration had not been allowing him or any other member of Congress to see Benghazi survivors more Republican members including Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and John McCain (R-AZ) are calling for survivors to be allowed to testify at hearings on Capitol Hill without fear of legal or career repercussions.Signers of the letter believe the House Select Committee should look into a number of issues including the lack of military response to the events in Benghazi if any non-military assistance was provided during the attack; the number U.S. personnel who were injured in Benghazi; the current locations of survivors; the names of the individuals in the White House Situation Room (WHSR) during the entire 8-hour period of the attacks and was a senior US military officer present.“As veterans from all aspects of Special Operations we have no doubt that there’s a lot more to what happened in Benghazi than President Obama and his Administration are letting on. From the very beginning he has attempted to mislead and outright lied to the American people about why the attack on September 11th 2012 happened how it happened and what our government did or did not do to save the lives of our patriots abroad” former Navy SEAL Captain Larry Bailey wrote in a statement to Breitbart News.The representatives from the retired military community want “a full accounting of the events of September 11 2012” adding that the “American public be fully informed regarding this egregious terrorist attack on US diplomatic personnel and facilities. We owe that truth to the American people and the families of the fallen.”SOF 700 Letter 4713,1
510,Some of these conflicts seem predictable and not particularly interesting. Yet Mr. Mazzetti effectively wades through the euphemisms and bureaucratic fog. When a Pentagon contractor sought to avoid infringing on the C.I.A.’s turf he said that what he was doing was not spying or gathering intelligence but rather collecting “atmospheric information.”“The Way of the Knife” has some flaws. The narrative sometimes seems disjointed because it occasionally bogs down in individual cases whose significance is unclear or in episodes that distract from the larger story.For example there’s Mr. Mazzetti’s superb handling — the best account yet — of the case of Raymond Davis the burly American spy jailed by Pakistani officials after he killed two men on the streets of Lahore. The book deftly explains how this case marked a fundamental turning point in American relations with Pakistan by showing that country’s intelligence service the extent to which the C.I.A. was operating inside its borders without its permission or even its knowledge.But then by contrast Mr. Mazzetti dwells unaccountably on a woman named Michele Ballarin a Virginia socialite who dabbled in influencing American policy toward Somalia. At first glance she seems an updated version of Joanne Herring the Texas supporter of the anti-Soviet resistance in Afghanistan whose flamboyant character was played by Julia Roberts in “Charlie Wilson’s War.” But the book never makes clear Ms. Ballarin’s background or motivations and the recurring accounts of her activities never seem to go anywhere.Another defect in “The Way of the Knife” is that it sometimes transmits the tall tales hype or braggadocio of the people Mr. Mazzetti interviewed. The book reports in passing that a C.I.A. official “penetrated the K.G.B. with dozens of highly placed moles in the 1970s” although based on cold war histories that claim seems highly inflated even for the agency as a whole much less an individual agent.Similarly another interviewee tells Mr. Mazzetti that “most of the C.I.A.’s informants in China were 80-year-old generals” although in the People’s Liberation Army these days there are few if any generals over 80 and I’d wager few if any of these are working for American intelligence. These highly dubious claims come not from the author himself but the people he interviewed — yet he might have showed some skepticism in reporting what they said.Over all though Mr. Mazzetti’s book stands up as a portrait of the secret wars. Recent developments have served to underscore the point of the book. The President’s Intelligence Advisory Board warned last month that the C.I.A. has become too focused on drone strikes and paramilitary operations; it recommended a renewed focus on traditional spying and analysis in places like China.“Many C.I.A. officers who joined the agency since Sept. 11 2001 have experienced only man hunting and killing” writes Mr. Mazzetti. Perhaps one can hope the C.I.A. will bring this era to a close.,1
511,Hagel said the U.S. Department of State was an adjunct of the Israeli foreign minister’s office according to a contemporaneous report of the event.Republican political consultant and Hagel supporter George Ajjan wrote about the March 2 2007 speech on his website the following day writing a description “point by point through some of the more important elements of his speech.”[Ajjan on point six:]The State Department has become adjunct to the Israeli Foreign Minister’s office …Wow. A very bold statement by Hagel bound to further raise the ire of the “Jewish Lobby” (yawn) but it does express his strong belief in a comprehensive solution to problems in the Middle East. Hagel mentioned this theme several times —comprehensive he said in the sense that all tools should be used to achieve American foreign policy objectives (diplomatic political economic and military) but also comprehensive in the James Baker sense of addressing the Arab-Israeli conflict holistically as both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush have proved too lazy and too incompetent to do.Reached by phone Ajjan confirmed his 2007 account of the event saying he was “taking notes as [Hagel] was speaking.”,1
512,"8 years ago(CNN) – Attorney General Eric Holder’s direct involvement in the decision to search a reporter’s e-mail records should bar him from leading a review of how the government investigates national security leaks Republicans argued Sunday.The decision to apply for a warrant to search Fox News reporter James Rosen’s private correspondence was vetted at the Justice Department's highest levels including Holder a Justice official said last week although the later decision to issue the warrant was made by a federal magistrate judge.The Obama administration's aggressive posture against leaks to reporters on national security matters has come under scrutiny as probes of Rosen and Associated Press reporters have come to light.It prompted Obama to announce on Thursday that he has directed Holder to review federal guidelines for investigating leaks and reporters. That review will include assembling a panel of media representatives.But Republicans argued Sunday that Holder was too entwined in the various leak investigations to objectively review his agency’s rules.“You cannot investigate yourself and I think it's a total conflict of interest” said Sen. Tom Coburn R-Oklahoma on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”MORE: News Corp long aware of Fox News subpoenaThe investigation into Rosen centered on a 2009 leak of intelligence related to North Korea and the potential ramifications of imposing further sanctions on the country. Investigators searched Rosen’s phone records e-mails and security badge logs at the State Department in the course of their probe.In a separate case records from Associated Press reporters and editors were seized as the government attempted to find out who leaked classified information about a terrorist plot based in Yemen.While employees of the AP were not cited as potential criminals an FBI affidavit used to obtain the warrant for Rosen's e-mails described him as potentially being an ""aider and abettor and/or co-conspirator"" to the crime of disclosing government secrets.A top State Department official was charged with leaking government secrets in the Rosen case though formal charges were never filed against Rosen or Fox News.The disclosure that government investigators have used journalists’ phone and e-mail records to try to ferret out leakers has led to an outcry from news organizations and civil liberties advocates. Speaking Thursday Obama said he was “troubled by the possibility that leak investigations may chill the investigative journalism that holds government accountable.""Earlier this month the White House said it was asking Sen. Charles Schumer D-New York to reintroduce so-called “reporter shield” legislation that would put in place stricter standards for government seizure of media records.The bill would switch the sensitive decisions on investigating journalists from the attorney general who is currently empowered to issue subpoenas to news organizations to a federal judge who is independent of the executive branch.Schumer said Sunday that he and Sen. Lindsey Graham have assembled a bipartisan group of eight senators to help push the measure forward.“If we can set up these rules I think we'll avoid the morass” Schumer said on CBS. “You always need set rules and an independent arbiter. We have neither now.”Graham appearing on “Fox News Sunday” said the recent Justice Department incidents are grounds for a special counsel who he argued could more objectively review the government’s rules for investigating journalists.“When classified information is leaked into the public that can put operations or American operatives in harm's way we've got to find a way to pursue that. But this is clearly an overreach” said Graham R-South Carolina.Even one Democrat said Holder’s impartiality was an open question. Sen. Dick Durbin on “Fox News Sunday” said he would “like to know if Holder has any conflict in here beyond what we've heard when it comes to the Fox case.”",1
513,Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) said Friday that the resignation of President Barack Obama’s Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano is not enough. He said Attorney General Eric Holder should step down too.“One down and one to go” Gosar said in a statement. “While Secretary Napolitano may be gone she will not be forgotten. Her inaction and incompetence on border security will continue to plague our nation for years to come.”“‘See no evil hear no evil and speak no evil’ is no way to govern and yet it is exactly how she and this administration operates” he continued. “The American public deserve better.”Gosar added that it is time for Holder to resign as well.“What the American people need now is for Attorney General Eric Holder to follow her lead and resign” Gosar said. “The American people have no confidence in him or his ability to do his job. My message to him would be: Better late than never. Today is a good day to go.”Gosar has a resolution in the House calling for Holder’s resignation that a number of members of Congress have signed onto. During the previous session 130 House members eight U.S. Senators and several governors from around the country called for Holder to resign over Operation Fast and Furious.In Fast and Furious the Obama administration’s Department of Justice and Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives allowed 2000 weapons bought through straw purchases to fall into the hands of Mexican drug cartels. Holder remains in both criminal and civil contempt of Congress for his failure to cooperate with the congressional investigation into the scandal which left hundreds of Mexican citizens and U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry dead.President Obama has asserted executive privilege to continue concealing thousands of pages of documents related to the scandal from Congress.Fast and Furious is hardly Holder’s only problem moving forward especially as House Republicans draw closer to obtaining the documents uncovered via a federal court lawsuit. The Attorney General faces multiple scandals particularly his decision to approve secret investigations into members of the news media. Holder reportedly met with President Obama on a forthcoming report on the DOJ’s activities in regards to that issue on Friday.The Associated Press noted how Gosar’s harsh words for Napolitano contrast sharply with those of his fellow Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain. McCain rushed to praise Napolitano for her work saying she “served our nation with honor.”Napolitano’s DHS released hundreds of illegal aliens from prisons earlier this year citing the sequester as the reason.,1

517,New footage of a speech by Chuck Hagel in 2008 has surfaced in which the former Senator mocked the idea of continuing the U.S. policy of confronting Iran and supporting Israel. “When I hear the talk about–well you can’t talk with Iran you can’t talk with Syria and we’re we should stay where we are and support Israel and so on well you miss the point” he told the laughing audience at an event for his book America: Our Next Chapter.Hagel added that the U.S. “shouldn’t even be thinking about the options of bombing Iran” even in the event of a nuclear attack on Israel and suggested Israel would be the first to attack Iran with a nuclear weapon.Hagel told the Senate on Jan. 31 that he could not provide records or video for more than four of the “hundreds” of speeches he had given over the previous five years because they had not been transcribed or recorded:We have given the committee every copy of every speech that I have that’s out there every video that I have that’s out there. On paid speeches most every one of those paid speeches–in the contract it says that they are private and not videotaped. That wasn’t my decision. That was the contract of the group I spoke to. I believe every paid speech I gave I didn’t have a prepared text. I gave it extemporaneously which is something I’ve been doing for long before I left the Senate.However records and recordings of many of those speeches do exist suggesting the administration either did not perform the due diligence necessary to comply with the Senate’s request or that Hagel misled the Senate.In the new footage which was uploaded to YouTube and is apparently from a question-and-answer session after his formal remarks Hagel fields a question about whether the U.S. would attack Iran to help defend Israel from an attack by Iran or one of its proxies that threatened Israel’s existence. He says that the U.S. should not attack Iran and that the U.S. should “engage” Iran instead–even in those circumstances:Q: [I]f Israel is attacked by Iran or an Iranian proxy like Hezbollah in a way that existentially threatens Israel almost to the extent that Israel was attacked in ’73 and it’s existentially threatened would you support an American airstrike using U.S. forces B2s whatever on Iran?” A: I’ll answer the question as honestly as I can. That’s a hypothetical question that somehow frames up the simplicity of the hypothetical question. The complications in the Middle East and I’m certainly not an expert there I have a chapter on the Middle East I do know [laughter] I know a little something about the Middle East. I spent a lot of time there. And I spent a lot of time in Israel with the prime minister and others. You who are well informed on this issue know the complexities starting with–go back to the Bible go back to ancient times thousands of years. I mean that if you really want to start trying to understand the Middle East Paul or David Aaron Miller who you may know has a new book out on this The Not So Promised Land [sic]. And if you want to read something that is very very enlightening this guy he’s getting tremendous reviews on it. He’s Jewish. He worked in the State Department  worked for Baker worked for Albright I think he’s worked for four Secretaries of State different Democrats Republicans. But it’s a great great book. But your question I mean the complication of what’s going on there Hamas is already attacking Israel. Iran supports Hamas. Iran supports Hezbollah. What I would much rather see is this administration or hopefully the next administration engage Iran engage Syria. When I hear the talk about–well you can’t talk with Iran you can’t talk with Syria and we’re we should stay where we are and support Israel and so on well you miss the point. Our policy has been so successful I believe hasn’t it [laughter] that the Middle East is far better off today than it’s ever been isn’t it? [Laughter.] I mean all those countries Lebanon is in great shape Gaza is in great shape Israel is in good shape Iran Iraq things have never looked better because we won’t talk to anybody. We are not going to have peace stability security or anything that even hints of it in the Middle East until Iran and Syria and all the players are part of it. Now that doesn’t apologize for or doesn’t close our eyes to what Iran has been doing what Iran does do. But unless they are engaged in some way then I don’t see this getting any better. And where this could go where this could eventually go–somebody was asking me the other day about a nuclear exchange in the world where that would come from? And I said well I’ll give you a scenario that’s very real. If Israel gets backed up enough into a corner and Israel uses a tactical theater nuclear weapon–you want to talk about seeing some things unravel in the world. The United States shouldn’t even be thinking about the options of bombing Iran or anybody else. I mean we got our hands full right now… [Applause]Last week Iranian “Supreme Leader” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei bluntly rejected the suggestion by Vice President Joe Biden that the U.S. and Iran should meet for direct bilateral talks on Iran’s nuclear program.,1
518,"Oren DorellUSA TODAY @OrenDorell on TwitterE-mails reveal administration officials were behind the crafting of a false narrative on BenghaziState Department was driving force behind revisions%2C analyst saysLawmaker wants to know why truth didn%27t come out right awayDozens of e-mails released by the White House reveal that Obama administration officials were behind the crafting of a false narrative about the attack in Benghazi Libya. The communications raise questions about who called the shots and why say an analyst and a lawmaker involved in the investigation.According to the documents officials at the State Department CIA and White House national security staff heavily revised a CIA memo to remove all references to Islamist extremists known to have participated in the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Libya.The revisions also removed the CIA's claims that the agency had issued repeated warnings to the State Department about the threat of al-Qaeda-linked militants in Benghazi.Among the unknowns:•Why were the revisions made?•Why did Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton testify before Congress that the edits were a product of the intelligence community when State officials had made many of the requests for alterations?•Why did the White House say it made no substantive edits when the e-mails show officials there helped lead the process for changes?•Where did the story come from that the attack grew from a protest against an anti-Islam video? The video was mentioned once in 100 pages of e-mails but it was a central theme of Obama's and Clinton's description of the event.""It's widely accepted as fact now that what the White House was spewing was demonstrably false"" says Rep. Jason Chaffetz R-Utah who is on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. ""I think there was clarity in the beginning but it became obscured by fiction over the course of time.""President Obama acknowledged during a news conference Thursday that ""there's been intense discussion in Congress lately about the attacks in Benghazi."" He said he is intent on doing everything in the government's power to prevent a similar tragedy and he is increasing security and military presence at high risk diplomatic posts. Congress should ""come together"" to provide needed funding he said.The e-mails from Sept. 14-15 show that the State Department was ""the key driving force for the revisions"" says Thomas Joscelyn an analyst with the Foundation for the Defense of Democracy in Washington.The White House has since acknowledged what the CIA stated from the beginning: The Benghazi attack was a planned terrorist attack.Chaffetz says many more documents need to be released to explain why the truth didn't come out right away.Major revisions to the CIA memo were requested by Victoria Nuland then-spokeswoman for the State Department who said changes were needed to ""resolve all my issues or those of my building leadership."" The e-mails do not state what leaders she referred to.Protests to the video ""came to be the central focal point"" of the administration's explanation of how the attack happened Chaffetz says but no such protest happened outside the consulate.Chaffetz says it's ""a mystery that only the White House can clarify.""Susan Rice the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations used the final version of the CIA memo when she went on talk shows Sept. 16 and blamed the attack that killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three others on the protests.Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings ranking Democrat on the oversight committee said the e-mails show that State Department and other administration officials altered the memo ""to protect the FBI's ongoing criminal investigation and our nation's intelligence operations.""He accused Republicans of making ""reckless accusations"" that the White House scrubbed the talking points for political reasons.Yet another question is why then-CIA chief David Petraeus who expressed displeasure with the final talking points did not act more forcefully to prevent the watered down version of his memo from being presented to lawmakers and the public.""As CIA director he has an ability to shape the narrative and if he thinks the narrative is incorrect he has a duty to speak up"" Joscelyn said.Though White House spokesman Jay Carney has insisted the White House made almost no changes to the original memo the e-mails show that Tommy Vietor then-spokesman for the White House's national security adviser wanted State Department concerns about the memo to be addressed.Members of Congress ""all think it was premeditated based on inaccurate assumptions or briefings. ... We need to brief members/press and correct the record""Vietor wrote in an e-mail Sept. 14.Nuland said in e-mails that the CIA memo's references to previous terrorist activity near the consulate and in the region could be construed by Congress as evidence that the State Department ignored the safety of its staff in Benghazi.The CIA retorted in the e-mails that the FBI ""did not have major concerns"" with the memo's findings. Evidence for its conclusions that the attack was preplanned by an al-Qaeda-linked terrorist group came from the claims of terror group Ansar al-Sharia and witness accounts forwarded by the CIA station chief in Tripoli.Even top State officials had acknowledged that fact before the process to edit it out began Chaffetz said.Chaffetz said one e-mail which was sent the day after the attack by Beth Jones State's acting assistant secretary for Near Eastern Affairs to several high ranking State Department officials described how she corrected the Libyan ambassador to the United States for suggesting the Benghazi attack may have been perpetrated by loyalists to ousted Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.Jones wrote to her supervisors Chaffetz says that the al-Qaeda-linked Libyan group Ansar al-Sharia was behind the attack.",1

520,"By Mark Hosenball WASHINGTON (Reuters) - British and U.S. intelligence officials say they are worried about a ""doomsday"" cache of highly classified heavily encrypted material they believe former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden has stored on a data cloud. The cache contains documents generated by the NSA and other agencies and includes names of U.S. and allied intelligence personnel seven current and former U.S. officials and other sources briefed on the matter said. The data is protected with sophisticated encryption and multiple passwords are needed to open it said two of the sources who like the others spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters. The passwords are in the possession of at least three different people and are valid for only a brief time window each day they said. The identities of persons who might have the passwords are unknown. Spokespeople for both NSA and the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment. One source described the cache of still unpublished material as Snowden's ""insurance policy"" against arrest or physical harm. U.S. officials and other sources said only a small proportion of the classified material Snowden downloaded during stints as a contract systems administrator for NSA has been made public. Some Obama Administration officials have said privately that Snowden downloaded enough material to fuel two more years of news stories. ""The worst is yet to come"" said one former U.S. official who follows the investigation closely. Snowden who is believed to have downloaded between 50000 and 200000 classified NSA and British government documents is living in Russia under temporary asylum where he fled after traveling to Hong Kong. He has been charged in the United States under the Espionage Act. Cryptome a website which started publishing leaked secret documents years before the group WikiLeaks or Snowden surfaced estimated that the total number of Snowden documents made public so far is over 500. Given Snowden's presence in Moscow and the low likelihood that he will return to the United States anytime soon U.S. and British authorities say they are focused more on dealing with the consequences of the material he has released than trying to apprehend him. It is unclear whether U.S. or allied intelligence agencies - or those of adversary services such as Russia's and China's - know where the material is stored and if so have tried to unlock it. One former senior U.S. official said that the Chinese and Russians have cryptographers skilled enough to open the cache if they find it. Snowden's revelations of government secrets have brought to light extensive and previously unknown surveillance of phone email and social media communications by the NSA and allied agencies. That has sparked several diplomatic rows between Washington and its allies along with civil liberties debates in Europe the United States and elsewhere. Among the material which Snowden acquired from classified government computer servers but which has not been published by media outlets known to have had access to it are documents containing names and resumes of employees working for NSA's British counterpart the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) sources familiar with the matter said. The sources said Snowden started downloading some of it from a classified GCHQ website known as GC-Wiki when he was employed by Dell and assigned to NSA in 2012. Snowden made a calculated decision to move from Dell Inc to another NSA contractor Booz Allen Hamilton because he would have wide-ranging access to NSA data at the latter firm one source with knowledge of the matter said. ""EXTREME PRECAUTIONS"" Glenn Greenwald who met with Snowden in Hong Kong and was among the first to report on the leaked documents for the Guardian newspaper said the former NSA contractor had ""taken extreme precautions to make sure many different people around the world have these archives to insure the stories will inevitably be published."" ""If anything happens at all to Edward Snowden he has arranged for them to get access to the full archives"" Greenwald said in a June interview with the Daily Beast website. He added: ""I don't know for sure whether has more documents than the ones he has given me... I believe he does."" In an email exchange with Reuters Greenwald who has said he remains in contact with Snowden affirmed his statements about Snowden's ""precautions"" but said he had nothing to add. Officials believe that the ""doomsday"" cache is stored and encrypted separately from any material that Snowden has provided to media outlets. Conservative British politicians including Louise Mensch a former member of parliament have accused the Guardian one of two media outlets to first publish stories based on Snowden's leaks of ""trafficking of GCHQ agents' names abroad."" No names of British intelligence personnel have been published by any media outlet. After U.K. officials informed the Guardian it could face legal action the newspaper disclosed it had destroyed computers containing Snowden material on GCHQ but had provided copies of the data to the New York Times and the U.S. nonprofit group ProPublica. Sources familiar with unpublished material Snowden downloaded said it also contains information about the CIA - possibly including personnel names - as well as other U.S. spy agencies such as the National Reconnaissance Office and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency which operate U.S. image-producing satellites and analyze their data. U.S. security officials have indicated in briefings they do not know what if any of the material is still in Snowden's personal possession. Snowden himself has been quoted as saying he took no such materials with him to Russia. (Editing by Warren Strobel and Tim Dobbyn)",1
521,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama's nominee for defense secretary on Thursday defended his views of the military and global threats in a combative confirmation hearing pushing back against criticism of his past statements on Israel Iran Iraq and nuclear weapons. Chuck Hagel told senators that America ""must engage — not retreat — in the world"" and insisted that his record is consistent on that point.The former two-term Republican senator faced strong GOP resistance and was forced to explain past remarks and votes even as he appeared on a path to confirmation as Obama second-term defense secretary and the nation's 24th Pentagon chief.His fiercest exchange came with Sen. John McCain R-Ariz. a fellow Vietnam veteran onetime close friend and a potential vote that would carry considerable sway. Politics and Hagel's evolving opposition to the Iraq war caused a split between the two men that was on full display at the confirmation hearing.McCain pressed Hagel on whether he was right or wrong about his opposition to the influx of 30000 U.S. troops in Iraq in 2007. Hagel who voted to authorize military force in Iraq later opposed the conflict comparing it to Vietnam and arguing that it shifted the focus from Afghanistan.""Were you right? Were you correct in your assessment?"" McCain asked.""I would defer to the judgment of history to sort that out"" Hagel said as the two men talked over each other.""The committee deserves your judgment as to whether you were right or wrong about the surge"" McCain insisted.Unable to elicit a simple answer McCain said the record should show that Hagel refused to answer.McCain made it clear that he would have the final word — with his vote which he said would be influenced by Hagel's refusal to answer yes or no.""I think history has already made a judgment about the surge sir and you're on the wrong side of it. And your refusal to answer whether you were right or wrong about it is going to have an impact on my judgment as to whether to vote for your confirmation or not"" he said.Story continuesHagel was the lone witness in a jam-packed hearing room at a session that could be crucial in determining whether he will win Senate confirmation and join Obama's second-term national security team. He spoke out forcefully for a strong military while trying to explain 12 years of Senate votes and numerous statements.""No one individual vote no one individual quote or no one individual statement defines me my beliefs or my record"" Hagel told the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""My overall worldview has never changed: that America has and must maintain the strongest military in the world; that we must lead the international community to confront threats and challenges together; and that we must use all tools of American power to protect our citizens and our interests.""Hagel 66 a decorated Vietnam combat veteran would be the lone Republican in Obama's cabinet and the first enlisted man to become defense secretary a point that Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin D-Mich. highlighted.""It would be a positive message for our soldiers sailors airmen and Marines in harm's way around the world to know that one of their own holds the highest office in the Department of Defense and that he has their backs"" Levin said.Two former committee chairmen — Democrat Sam Nunn and Republican John Warner — introduced the nominee.""War for Chuck Hagel is not an abstraction"" Nunn said.Hagel has the announced backing of about a dozen Democrats and the tacit support of dozens more who are unlikely to embarrass the president by defeating his Cabinet pick. One Republican — Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi — has said he will vote for his former colleague.Seven Republicans including four members of the Armed Services panel have said they will oppose Hagel's nomination. Sen. Marco Rubio R-Fla. announced his opposition on Thursday saying Hagel's views ""are too apart from what I believe to be the way forward for preserving America's proper role in the world.""Democrats hold a 55-45 advantage in the Senate.Republicans repeatedly questioned Hagel about a May 2012 study that he co-authored by the advocacy group Global Zero that called for an 80 percent reduction of U.S. nuclear weapons and elimination of all nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles.The group argued that with the Cold War over the United States needs no more than 900 total nuclear weapons. Currently the U.S. and Russia have about 5000 each either deployed or in reserve. Both countries are on track to reduce the deployed strategic warheads to 1550 by 2018 the number set in the New START treaty that the Senate ratified in December 2010.Sen. Deb Fischer R-Neb. quoted from the report and expressed serious misgivings.""Many of my colleagues are concerned you've changed your views. My concerns are that you haven't changed your views. You continue to hold extreme views far to the left even of this administration"" said Fischer.In last year's Senate race Hagel endorsed Fischer's Democratic rival former Sen. Bob Kerrey who also is a decorated Vietnam combat veteran.Hagel insisted that the report was illustrative and said it wasn't realistic to consider unilateral reductions.In an exchange with Sen. Bill Nelson D-Fla. Hagel sought to explain that his wartime experience in which he was wounded twice informed his decisions and votes.""It does condition you"" he said. ""I'm not shaped framed molded consumed by that experience. Of course not. But it's part of me.""Once the hearing was under way the Republican National Committee put out a news release titled ""Chuck Hagel is the Wrong Choice for Secretary of Defense"" and contending that he would weaken the nation's military.Responding specifically to attacks from outside GOP-leaning groups Hagel repeated his regrets about using the term ""Jewish lobby"" to refer to pro-Israel groups. He said he should have used another term.""I should have used another term and I'm sorry and I regret it"" Hagel said. ""On the use of intimidation I should have used 'influence' I think would have been more appropriate.""Hagel said he was committed to Obama's goal of ensuring that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon and insisted that all options including military force are on the table.""My policy is one of prevention and not one of containment — and the president has made clear that is the policy of our government"" Hagel said.Under questioning Hagel said he always supported multilateral sanctions against Iran but acknowledged that he cast votes against unilateral sanctions on a case-by-case basis. He argued that in some cases such as votes in 2001-2002 he was taking into account the concerns of Republican President George W. Bush.He also countered with votes and letters against Iran and Hezbollah.""There's a more complete record than just one or two or three or four"" votes Hagel said insisting that he has been on the record many times saying Hamas and Hezbollah are terrorist organizations and Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism.Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina was harshly critical of Hagel for failing to sign letters to the European Union and the president in years past on designating Hezbollah a terrorist organization and backing Israel.""The lack of signature by you runs chills up my spine"" Graham complained.",1
522,"Ron JohnsonDuring her Senate testimony Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated that approximately 25 Americans who were on the ground or who witnessed the terrorist attack in Benghazi were immediately evacuated. Secretary Clinton also revealed that neither she nor her senior people debriefed or spoke with those people immediately after the attack or for months afterward to understand what happened. She stated that she didn't want to be later accused of playing politics.When I questioned her about the misinformation disseminated for days by the administration most notably by Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice on Sunday news programs five days after the attack she asked ""What difference does it make?""If you don't expeditiously debrief the people who witnessed the attack how can you understand who initiated it what weapons they used and who may have been involved? How do you initiate a proper response if you don't know what transpired? How do you move properly to protect other American assets and people in the region? How do you know what failures occurred so that you can immediately correct them if you have not debriefed the very victims of those failures? And lastly how do you tell the truth to the American people if you don't know the facts?Our diplomatic forces in Benghazi were denied the security they repeatedly requested for many months before Sept. 11 2012. Secretary Clinton stated that she was not told of those desperate requests in the most dangerous region in the world. As a result our people in Benghazi were ill-prepared to repel or avoid that attack and four Americans were murdered. For many days after the event the American people were also misinformed as to the nature and perpetrators of that attack.In truth Benghazi is a failure of leadership — before during and after the terrorist attack.To answer Secretary Clinton it does make a difference. It matters enormously for the American public to know whether or not their president and members of his administration are on top of a crisis and telling them the truth.Sen. Ron Johnson R-Wis. is a member of the Foreign Relations Committee.",1
523,Leaders of the nation’s biggest technology firms warned President Obama during a lengthy meeting at the White House on Tuesday that National Security Agency spying programs are damaging their reputations and could harm the broader economy.Cisco Systems has said it is seeing customers especially overseas back away from American-branded technology after documents revealed that the NSA enlisted tech firms and secretly tapped into their data hubs around the world as the agency pursued terrorism suspects. Companies such as IBM AT&T and Verizon Communications are facing angry shareholders some of whom have filed lawsuits demanding that the companies disclose their participation in NSA intelligence programs.The companies also pressed the need for transparency and for limits on surveillance to restore the credibility of the U.S. government. They wanted an explanation of what the NSA was doing overseas to collect their data and to be able to talk about it said industry and U.S. officials briefed on the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss it freely.“Most companies” in the room pressed this point “and they did so loudly” said one U.S. official.Obama said that he heard their message and that the White House would consider the group’s views as it completed a review of NSA surveillance programs.Silicon Valley has been a critical driver of the economic recovery and has long represented the face of American ingenuity around the world. Many of these companies say they are still trying to assess the damage caused by Edward Snowden’s leak of NSA documents showing their work with intelligence officials.But some shareholders say Silicon Valley has been slow to recognize the reputational crisis that is developing around the world for these companies. “Verizon and AT&T are not managing this crisis effectively” said Jonas Kron director of shareholder advocacy at Trillium an investment advisory firm. “Now is the time for these companies to demonstrate that they will protect user privacy.”The morning meeting at the White House held in the Roosevelt Room took on added import given a federal judge’s ruling Monday that the NSA’s counterterrorism program to collect Americans’ phone records appears to be unconstitutional. That along with the outcry from Silicon Valley and civil liberties advocates some of whom belong to Obama’s party is increasing pressure on the administration to curb NSA surveillance efforts.The gathering was scheduled for two hours but went well over the allotted time with the majority of the discussion focused on the companies’ demands for changes to NSA spying programs according to tech industry officials.Several of the executives came to the meeting particularly angered over a Washington Post report in late October that revealed the NSA and its British counterpart Government Communications Headquarters or GCHQ were gaining access to the data connections that link Google and Yahoo servers around the world industry officials said.Their message was to say: “What the hell are you doing? Are you really hacking into the infrastructure of American companies overseas? The same American companies that cooperate with your lawful orders and spend a lot of money to comply with them to facilitate your intelligence collection?” said one industry official familiar with the companies’ views.The NSA has stressed that its overseas collection is carried out lawfully under executive authority. Any data on Americans are handled according to rules that protect their privacy including the requirement to obtain a warrant to target an American’s communications officials say.In the meeting the executives reiterated a list of demands that had been sent to the White House in a letter last week calling on the administration to cease bulk data collection of e-mails online address books and other personal information; to impose limits on how easily the NSA can obtain court orders for Internet data; and to allow the companies to be more transparent about government intelligence requests.Several participants acknowledged that the White House had to balance the companies’ business concerns against national security considerations.Senior administration officials described the meeting with the 15 executives as “constructive not at all contentious.”“This was an opportunity for the President to hear from CEOs directly as we near completion of our review of signals intelligence programs building on the feedback we’ve received from the private sector in recent weeks and months” the White House said in a statement.One participant suggested the president pardon Snowden. Obama said he could not do so said one industry official. White House officials have said that Snowden is accused of leaking classified information and faces felony charges in the United States and that he should be returned as soon as possible to the United States “where he will be accorded full due process and protections.”Senior executives from AT&T Yahoo Apple Netflix Twitter Google Microsoft and Facebook were among those in attendance.“We appreciated the opportunity to share directly with the President our principles on government surveillance that we released last week and we urged him to move aggressively on reform” the technology firms said in a joint statement after the meeting.Many of these firms have played a key role in boosting Obama’s political fortunes. Tech companies pumped nearly $7.8 million into his campaign in the last cycle according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.Some of the top officials meeting with the president Tuesday served as bundlers for his 2012 bid. Yahoo’s chief executive Marissa Mayer raised between $100000 and $200000 according to the center and Shervin Pish­evar co-founder of the Sherpa technology investment fund raised more than $500000. Mark Pincus Zynga’s chief product officer and chairman gave $1 million to Priorities Action USA the super PAC that supported Obama.Still some of these executives as well as their shareholders are fretting about the ­bottom-line impact of the NSA intelligence programs.In Cisco’s earnings report last month executives explained that disappointing sales in emerging markets were partly tied to the NSA leaks which may have “caused a number of customers to pause and reevaluate” Cisco’s head of sales Robert Lloyd said at the time.Last week IBM shareholders sued the company in a New York federal court saying that it harmed investors with its secret participation in NSA programs.“IBM’s association with the NSA presented a material risk to the company’s sales and in particular . . . sales in China that were of critical importance to investors” the Louisiana Sheriffs’ Pension and Relief Fund said in its lawsuit. “Despite that knowledge . . . IBM misrepresented to investors that it was a market leader in the Asia-Pacific region and that IBM expected solid improvement in the sales of its hardware division.”Last month shareholders of Verizon and AT&T demanded that the companies disclose their participation in NSA intelligence programs.The $160.7 billion New York State Common Retirement Fund filed a resolution with AT&T’s board to make public its participation in government intelligence programs. The pension fund argued that customers can too easily switch to another wireless carrier amid concerns that AT&T is sharing telephone data and other information with the government.The meeting at the White House was the second time top Silicon Valley and telecommunications leaders have convened with Obama since Snowden began to release portions of a trove of top-secret documents detailing NSA spying programs.Obama tried to keep the tenor friendly even cracking jokes an industry official said.At one point he asked Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings if he brought advanced copies of the second season of “House of Cards” a satire-drama of Washington politics according to a pool report of the meeting.Hastings laughed and invited Obama to do a cameo appearance on the show. Obama said of the ruthless lead character a congressman played by Kevin Spacey “This guy’s getting a lot of stuff done.”“I wish things were that ruthlessly efficient” Obama said to laughter from all the tech executives.Juliet Eilperin and Matea Gold contributed to this report.,1
524,Left-wing media critic Jeff Cohen has been all over cable news as a contributor but for a time he worked as a senior producer for MSNBC. Monday in the wake of the NSA spying scandal Cohen lashed out at his former employer as the “official network of the Obama White House.”This isn’t exactly news to the most of us but MSNBC’s water carrying for Obama’s massive surveillance state apparently woke Mr. Cohen up:When it comes to issues of U.S. militarism and spying the allegedly “progressive” MSNBC often seems closer to the “official network of the Obama White House” than anything resembling an independent channel. With a few exceptions (especially Chris Hayes [10]) MSNBC has usually reacted to expanded militarism and surveillance by downplaying the abuses or defending them.Had McCain or Romney defeated Obama and implemented the exact same policies treating whistleblowers like Manning and Snowden as foreign espionage agents one would expect MSNBC hosts to be loudly denouncing the Republican abuses of authority.Cohen then names names:As Snowden arrived in Russia from Hong Kong MSNBC host Ed Schultz blustered on [12] about Snowden as a “punk” and “coward.” …MSNBC’s Melissa Harris-Perry has been condemning Snowden [14] by contrasting him with civil disobedients who “love their country” and submit to arrest – while Snowden just wants to “save his own skin [11].” …MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow has also disappointed. After doing a typically thorough presentation on the force-down of President’s Morales’ plane she ended her report [17] by expressing displeasure only that Washington had apparently gotten allies to go out on the limb “for nothing.”For the most part the left is perfectly okay with MSNBC being a branch of the Obama White House on every other issue. It is only on issues the left disagree with like this spying business that brings out the complaints.MSNBC is at least being consistent.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC,1
525,WASHINGTON -- The White House and State Department signed off on surveillance targeting phone conversations of friendly foreign leaders current and former U.S. intelligence officials said Monday pushing back against assertions that President Obama and his aides were unaware of the high-level eavesdropping.Professional staff members at the National Security Agency and other U.S. intelligence agencies are angry these officials say believing the president has cast them adrift as he tries to distance himself from the disclosures by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden that have strained ties with close allies.The resistance emerged as the White House said it would curtail foreign intelligence collection in some cases and two senior U.S. senators called for investigations of the practice.France Germany Italy Mexico and Sweden have all publicly complained about the NSA surveillance operations which reportedly captured private cellphone conversations by German Chancellor Angela Merkel among other foreign leaders.AdvertisementFOR THE RECORD:U.S. spying: An article in the Oct. 29 front section about U.S. spying on foreign leaders misidentified Sen. John McCain as the ranking minority member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He is a member of the committee but no longer the ranking member.On Monday as Spain joined the protest the fallout also spread to Capitol Hill.PHOTOS: 2013’s memorable political momentsUntil now members of Congress have chiefly focused their attention on Snowden’s disclosures about the NSA’s collection of U.S. telephone and email records under secret court orders.“With respect to NSA collection of intelligence on leaders of U.S. allies — including France Spain Mexico and Germany — let me state unequivocally: I am totally opposed” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee.Advertisement“Unless the United States is engaged in hostilities against a country or there is an emergency need for this type of surveillance I do not believe the United States should be collecting phone calls or emails of friendly presidents and prime ministers” she said in a statement.Feinstein said the Intelligence Committee had not been told of “certain surveillance activities” for more than a decade and she said she would initiate a major review of the NSA operation. She added that the White House had informed her that “collection on our allies will not continue” although other officials said most U.S. surveillance overseas would not be affected.Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) ranking minority member of the Armed Services Committee said Congress should consider creating a special select committee to examine U.S. eavesdropping on foreign leaders.“Obviously we’re going to want to know exactly what the president knew and when he knew it” McCain told reporters in Chicago. “We have always eavesdropped on people around the world. But the advance of technology has given us enormous capabilities and I think you might make an argument that some of this capability has been very offensive both to us and to our allies.”AdvertisementIn Madrid Spanish Foreign Ministry officials summoned the U.S. ambassador to object to the alleged NSA communications net in Spain. Citing documents leaked by Snowden El Mundo a major Spanish daily said the U.S. spy agency had collected data on more than 60 million phone calls made in just 30 days from early December 2012 to early January 2013.PHOTOS: President Obama’s pastPrecisely how the surveillance is conducted is unclear. But if a foreign leader is targeted for eavesdropping the relevant U.S. ambassador and the National Security Council staffer at the White House who deals with the country are given regular reports said two former senior intelligence officials who spoke on condition of anonymity in discussing classified information.Obama may not have been specifically briefed on NSA operations targeting a foreign leader’s cellphone or email communications one of the officials said. “But certainly the National Security Council and senior people across the intelligence community knew exactly what was going on and to suggest otherwise is ridiculous.”AdvertisementIf U.S. spying on key foreign leaders was news to the White House current and former officials said then White House officials have not been reading their briefing books.Some U.S. intelligence officials said they were being blamed by the White House for conducting surveillance that was authorized under the law and utilized at the White House.“People are furious” said a senior intelligence official who would not be identified discussing classified information. “This is officially the White House cutting off the intelligence community.”Any decision to spy on friendly foreign leaders is made with input from the State Department which considers the political risk the official said. Any useful intelligence is then given to the president’s counter-terrorism advisor Lisa Monaco among other White House officials.AdvertisementJay Carney the White House press secretary said Monday that Obama had ordered a review of surveillance capabilities including those affecting America’s closest foreign partners and allies.“Our review is looking across the board at our intelligence gathering to ensure that as we gather intelligence we are properly accounting for both the security of our citizens and our allies and the privacy concerns shared by Americans and citizens around the world” Carney said.PHOTOS: Famous document leakersCaitlin Hayden spokeswoman for the National Security Council said the review would examine “whether we have the appropriate posture when it comes to heads of state how we coordinate with our closest allies and partners and what further guiding principles or constraints might be appropriate for our efforts.”AdvertisementShe said the review should be completed this year.Citing documents from Snowden the German news magazine Der Spiegel reported last week that the NSA’s Special Collection Service had monitored Merkel’s cellphone since 2002. Obama subsequently called Merkel and told her he was not aware her phone had been hacked U.S. officials said.Intelligence officials also disputed a Wall Street Journal article Monday that said the White House had learned only this summer — during a review of surveillance operations that might be exposed by Snowden — about an NSA program to monitor communications of 35 world leaders. Since then officials said several of the eavesdropping operations have been stopped because of political sensitivities.ken.dilanian@latimes.comAdvertisementStobart is a news assistant in The Times’ London bureau.

526,"Glenn Harlan ReynoldsThe NSA spying scandal goes deep%2C and the only upside is that it will distract from other scandals.Sooner or later%2C power granted tends to become power abused.Most Americans generally think that politicians are untrustworthy.""How ironic is that? We wanted a president that listens to all Americans -- now we have one."" That was Jay Leno's take on the Obama administration's expanding NSA spying scandal which has gone beyond Verizon phone records to include Google Facebook Yahoo and just about all the other major tech companies except apparently for Twitter.The NSA spying scandal goes deep and the Obama administration's only upside is that the furor over its poking into Americans' private business on a wholesale basis will distract people from the furor over the use of the IRS and other federal agencies to target political enemies -- and even donors to Republican causes -- and the furor over the Benghazi screwup and subsequent lies (scapegoated filmmaker Nakoula is still in jail) the furor over the ""Fast And Furious"" gunrunning scandal that left literally scores of Mexicans dead the scandal over the DOJ's poking into phone records of journalists (and their parents) HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius' shakedown of companies she regulates for ""donations"" to pay for ObamaCare implementation that Congress has refused to fund the Pigford scandal where the Treasury Department's ""Judgment Fund"" appears to have been raided for political purposes -- well it's getting to where you need a scorecard to keep up.But in fact there's a common theme in all of these scandals: Abuse of power. And what's more that abuse-of-power theme is what makes the NSA snooping story bigger than it otherwise would be. It all comes down to trust.The justification for giving the government a lot of snooping power hangs on two key arguments: That snooping will make us safer and that the snooping power won't be abused.Has it made us safer? Anonymous government sources quoted in news reports say yes but we know that all that snooping didn't catch the Tsarnaev brothers before they bombed the Boston Marathon -- even though they made extensive use of email and the Internet and even though Russian security officials had warned us that they were a threat. The snooping didn't catch Major Nidal Hasan before he perpetrated the Fort Hood Massacre though he should have been spotted easily enough. It didn't apparently warn us of the Benghazi attacks -- though perhaps it explains how administration flacks were able to find and scapegoat a YouTube filmmaker so quickly . But in terms of keeping us safe the snooping doesn't look so great.As for abuse well is it plausible to believe that a government that would abuse the powers of the IRS to attack political enemies go after journalists who publish unflattering material or scapegoat a filmmaker in the hopes of providing political cover to an election-season claim that al-Qaeda was finished would have any qualms about misusing the massive power of government-run snooping and Big Data? What we've seen here is a pattern of abuse. There's little reason to think that pattern will change absent a change of administration -- and quite possibly not even then. Sooner or later power granted tends to become power abused. Then there's the risk that information gathered might leak of course as recent events demonstrate.Most Americans generally think that politicians are untrustworthy. So why trust them with so much power? The evidence to date strongly suggests that they aren't worthy of it.Glenn Harlan Reynolds is professor of law at the University of Tennessee.

527,"President Obama is being accused of selectively quoting Usama bin Laden by using a snippet of an anti-America screed to make it sound like Al Qaeda was breaking under the weight of the U.S. drone program.Obama quoted the Al Qaeda leader during his wide-ranging speech on counterterrorism policy last Thursday in Washington. As part of his argument in defense of the lethal drone program Obama suggested bin Laden himself deemed the strikes to be effective.""Don't take my word for it"" Obama said. ""In the intelligence gathered at bin Laden's compound we found that he wrote 'We could lose the reserves to enemy's airstrikes. We cannot fight airstrikes with explosives.'""It is without question that the strikes have killed key terror leaders and have changed the way Al Qaeda and its affiliates operate. The bin Laden document Obama referenced said as much.But the document -- one of several bin Laden writings published by West Point's Combating Terrorism Center -- showed bin Laden discussing how drones strikes have changed his organization's tactics not necessarily how they have Al Qaeda on the run.More On This...The document which refers repeatedly to the ""ummah"" or Muslim population says: ""The Ummah should put forward some but enough forces to fight America. The Ummah must keep some of its forces on reserve. This will be in the Ummah's best interests. The Ummah will use the reserve in the future but during the appropriate time.""In the meanwhile we do not want to send the reserves to the front line especially in areas where the enemy only uses airstrikes to attack our forces. So the reserves will not for the most part be effective in such conflicts. Basically we could lose the reserves to enemy's airstrikes. We cannot fight air strikes with explosives!""The document goes on to say that ""we still have a powerful force which we can organize and prepare for deployment.""Thomas Joscelyn a senior fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies argued that bin Laden's full quote has a far different meaning than that conveyed by the excerpt Obama cited last week.""When you look at the context of the whole statement it doesn't support their story"" he told FoxNews.com.He acknowledged that the drones have killed senior terrorists but said ""it's just more complicated than that.""Joscelyn wrote in The Weekly Standard: ""The full quote actually supports a different argument -- that al Qaeda's 'reserves' have been removed from the drones' kill box. It is quite obvious that improvised explosive devices car bombs small arms and the like cannot take out unmanned drones. So Al Qaeda has simply moved some of its forces elsewhere.""Joscelyn said the ""selective citation"" speaks to a broader problem -- ""the president and his administration only see what they want to see in the fight against Al Qaeda and affiliates groups.""In his counterterrorism speech Obama said the ""core of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan is on the path to defeat"" while at the same time acknowledging Al Qaeda affiliates continue to threaten U.S. interests.Obama vowed to put new limits on the U.S. drone program while defending the need for it in an unconventional war.Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham speaking on ""Fox News Sunday"" accused Obama of ""sounding retreat"" in the address.""At the end of the day this is the most tone-deaf president I ever could imagine"" he said.Other lawmakers praised Obama for taking new steps to disclose details about the U.S. drone program.""I am also encouraged that the administration is taking steps to improve transparency as it pertains to the use of lethal force particularly when it comes to the possible targeting of U.S. citizens"" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy D-Vt. said last week.",0

""Nobody is more committed to getting this right. I am determined to leave the State Department and our country safer stronger and more secure.""Clinton bristled at claims that the administration misled the public by initially linking the attack to a protest that spiraled out of control.Sen. Ron Johnson R-Wis said ""a simple phone call"" to people in Benghazi ""would have established immediately"" that there was no protest. ""Why wasn't that known?"" he asked.Clinton said State Department officials decided it was not appropriate to talk to U.S. officials in Benghazi before the FBI conducted their interviews. Pressed further on why that call wasn't made Clinton erupted in anger.""With all due respect the fact is we had four dead Americans"" she said. ""Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night and decided they'd go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again Senator.""Job One she said is to find the killers and ""bring them to justice.""Clinton in what could be her last congressional testimony before leaving her post said the deaths were ""personal"" for her.She was near tears as she talked of standing next to President Obama ""as the Marines carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews (Air Force Base). I put my arms around the mothers and fathers sisters and brothers sons and daughters.""Sen. John McCain R-Ariz. gave Clinton a warm but brief welcome before quickly pressing her on security issues at the consulate. He said when he met with U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens on July 7 — more than two months before the attack — Stevens expressed ""his deep and grave concerns about security in Benghazi … and the need for additional assistance.""Clinton said requests for more security never reached her desk. McCain said the administration's ""preference for a 'soft footprint' was part of the reason for what took place"" in Benghazi.An Independent Accountability Review Board appointed by the State Department concluded that ""systemic failures"" left the consulate in Benghazi inadequately protected and confirmed that no protest preceded the deadly attack. In a report released in December the board recommended that the State Department strengthen security in high-risk posts.Clinton told the committee she has asked a deputy secretary to lead a task force to ensure that all 29 of the panels recommendations are implemented quickly and completely — and to pursue ""additional steps above and beyond"" those in the board's report.""Benghazi did not happen in a vacuum"" Clinton said. The instability brought on by the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011 has expanded the reach of extremists across North Africa she said.The State Department for days after the Sept. 11 attack blamed it on a spontaneous protest of what it called a ""reprehensible"" video that denigrated Islam's prophet Mohammed while CIA and diplomats from the scene were reporting that no protest preceded the attack.Clinton testified that on the day of the attack before it happened she had been at the State Department dealing with a different crisis that evolved from protests to a YouTube video that disparaged Mohammed.""During most of the day prior to getting notice of the attack on our compound in Benghazi we were very focused on the situation around our embassy in Cairo"" Clinton said. ""There were attempts to scale the wall and we were in close contact with our counterparts in Cairo.""When the attack in Benghazi happened about 4 p.m. Washington time she called Libyan security officials ""to get assistance as quickly as possible.""Clinton testified she spoke to National Security Adviser Tom Donilon then-CIA director Gen. David Petraeus who had a compound in Benghazi and the White House.She said U.S. officials participated in talks about what to do in a secure video conference with senior officials from the White House the intelligence community and the Defense Department.""I spoke to President Obama later in the day"" she said.Sen. Jim Risch R-Idaho asked Clinton if she selected Susan Rice U.S. ambassador to the United Nations to go on the Sunday talk shows where she blamed the attack on a video days after it was clear the attack was terrorism.""I did not"" Clinton said.Rice's television appearances five days after the attack derailed her possible nomination to replace Clinton as secretary of State. Clinton said she was too busy at the time to appear on TV herself.""I was not focused on talking points"" Clinton said. ""I was focused on keeping our people safe. We still had people attacking our embassy in Yemen trying to scale the walls. I had to call the president in Tunis and beg him to send reinforcements which he did and eventually saved our embassy there.""Also the classified intelligence assessment of the Benghazi attack was still cloudy about what it was she said.""There were a variety of potential causes and triggers"" Clinton said.There were some communications and coordination before the attack but it still wasn't clear if it rose to the level of a pre-planned terrorist attack she said.Clinton testified that her department reacted to the attack by taking immediate steps to protect personnel and postings in embassies and consulates facing large protests around the world.At the House hearing Rep. Chris Smith R-N.J. noted that Clinton had been ""very close"" to Stevens and wondered whether he had ever personally asked her to get involved.""No. None of those cables ever came before me"" Clinton replied.""Chris Stevens who knew more about Libya than anyone else I know in this country didn't see a direct threat to our diplomatic facilities and also neither did our intelligence community"" Clinton said. ""They did not make the connection between the deteriorating security and a direct threat on our compound.""Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen R-Fla. asked why no one was significantly disciplined despite State Department claims that employees responsible for poor security in Benghazi would be disciplined.""There has just been a shuffling of the deck chairs"" Ros-Lehtinen said. ""Do you find it acceptable that officials who were responsible remain employed at the State Department?""Clinton said all four individuals have been removed from their jobs and put on administrative leave.""This is something I need your help with"" Clinton said. The administrative review board found that under U.S. law ""unsatisfactory leadership is not satisfactory for a breach of duty"" she said. ""I have put forth to the Congress and Senate to fix that problem going forward.""Danielle Pletka an analyst for the conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute said Clinton's testimony provided more questions than answers.Clinton's assertion that she did not see cables from Stevens and his security chief asking for more security reflects ""a general vibe"" throughout the administration that the White House is not going to look kindly on anything that implies the country was facing a higher threat level Pletka said.Clinton's testimony was an effort to make the hearing about the aftermath rather than about why it happened Pletka said. ""Understanding why it happened who was responsible and what lies were told makes a huge difference"" she said.Contributing: John Bacon",1

531,Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) will honor former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton with this year’s Liberty Medal from the National Constitution Center. The award will be presented to Clinton on September 10th the eve of the first anniversary of the terrorist attack on the United States mission in Benghazi that killed four Americans.The Christian Science Monitor reports that Bush a potential GOP contender in the 2016 presidential race is chairman of the board of trustees of the National Constitution Center located in Philadelphia.“Former Secretary Clinton has dedicated her life to serving and engaging people across the world in democracy” Bush said in a statement. “These efforts as a citizen an activist and a leader have earned Secretary Clinton this year’s Liberty Medal.”Bush’s decision to honor Clinton who is considered by some to be a likely Democrat candidate for president in 2016 was condemned by the Independence Hall Tea Party Association of Philadelphia. According to the Christian Science Monitor the organization released its own statement Monday referring to the event as “extremely distressing” and offering instead an opportunity for another Liberty Medal recipient.According to the statement:As all of you undoubtedly know much of the blame for the Obama Administration’s failure to contain the Benghazi attack and the scandalous handling of its aftermath can be traced directly to Ms. Clinton. Indeed a Congressional investigation regarding Ms. Clinton’s role in the cover-up of the Administration’s failure is still ongoing. A newly formed organization the Independence Hall Foundation will hold a “What Difference Does It Make” press conference on Independence Mall September 10 4 PM to denounce the selection of Ms. Clinton as the 2013 Liberty Medal recipient and to offer an alternative award (details below).

533,WASHINGTON — Email traffic exchanged during the drafting of talking points about the deadly attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi Libya last year shows that the State Department and White House were more involved in shaping the document than they previously let on.The newly released emails highlight the political concerns expressed in those discussions as President Obama’s administration wrestled with what to tell the public in the wake of the September attack and in the midst of the presidential campaign.AdvertisementThe emails show that the original CIA document underwent several revisions including one pushed by the State Department to delete a reference to CIA warnings about the terrorist threat around the diplomatic outpost.That information “could be abused by members [of Congress] to beat up the State Department for not paying attention to warnings” State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland wrote according to emails read to the Los Angeles Times by a congressional source. They were originally reported by the conservative weekly magazine Weekly Standard and ABC News. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney did not dispute their authenticity during a lengthy explanation Friday afternoon.AdvertisementThe talking points were originally written for members of Congress who might speak publicly about the attack that killed U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. They also went to United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice as she prepared for Sunday news shows five days after the attack.Carney said Friday that the talking points were drafted as the facts were coming to light and that officials were trying to say what they knew without speculating about the unknown.Advertisement“The effort is always to in that circumstance and with an ongoing investigation and a lot of information some of it accurate some of it not about what had happened and who was responsible to provide information for members of Congress and others in the administration for example who might speak publicly about it that was based on only what the intelligence community could say for sure it thought it knew” Carney said.The emails indicate that Nuland was the driving force behind significant changes.AdvertisementThe information about the advance warning could be used by Congress to criticize the State Department Nuland wrote “so why do we want to feed that?”She was reacting to a paragraph that said the CIA had previously warned of a threat of “extremists linked to Al Qaeda in Benghazi and eastern Libya.”Advertisement“We cannot rule out the individuals have previously surveilled the U.S. facilities also contributing to the efficacy of the attacks” the original document read.Nuland also objected to a line that mentioned a militant group Ansar al Sharia which had taken credit for the attack.Advertisement“I have serious concerns about all parts highlighted below” she wrote questioning why the administration was “arming members of Congress to start making assertions to the media that we ourselves are not making because we don’t want to prejudice the FBI investigation. Why do we want the Hill to be fingering Ansar al Sharia when we aren’t doing that ourselves?”The FBI had signed off on the mention of Ansar al Sharia according to an email by a staffer who was coordinating the interagency negotiations.AdvertisementBen Rhodes a deputy national security advisor at the White House wrote in a subsequent email that Nuland’s concerns would have to be taken into account.The emails were discussed though not quoted in a report by House Republicans released last month. Nuland was not named and little was made of it.AdvertisementBut the wording of the actual emails raised new questions in a contentious news conference Friday. Previously Carney had said the changes to the talking points were stylistic not substantive.Some members of Congress were shown the emails months ago according to senior administration officials and raised no objections. House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) demanded that the White House release all of the emails for review.Advertisement“Congress is going to continue to investigate this issue using all the resources at our disposal” he said in a statement from his office.christi.parsons@latimes.comAdvertisementken.dilanian@latimes.com,1

537,Keep your distance: The director of national intelligence is having intestinal distress.“For me it is literally — not figuratively literally — gut-wrenching to see this happen” James Clapper told Andrea Mitchell over the weekend referring to leaks about the government’s secret program to collect vast troves of phone and Internet data.There might be a bit more sympathy for Clapper’s digestive difficulty if he hadn’t delivered a kick in the gut to the American public just three months ago.Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) asked Clapper at a Senate hearing in March “Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?”“No sir” Clapper testified.Ann Telnaes animation: The NSA’s data gathering technique (Ann Telnaes/The Washington Post)“It does not?” Wyden pressed.“Not wittingly. There are cases where they could inadvertently perhaps collect but not wittingly.”We now know that Clapper was not telling the truth. The National Security Agency is quite wittingly collecting phone records of millions of Americans and much more.As the administration and some in Congress vent their anger about leaks to The Post and to Britain’s Guardian newspaper officials have only themselves to blame. It is precisely their effort to hide such a vast and consequential program from the American public that caused this pressure valve to burst. Instead of allowing a democratic debate about the programs in broad terms that would not have compromised national security their attempts to keep the public in the dark have created a backlash in which the risks to national security can’t be controlled.Edward Snowden the leaker did the honorable thing in revealing his identity; it would be more honorable if he would turn himself in and face the consequences for his law-breaking. But there is little honor in the way administration officials and lawmakers have avoided responsibility. Obama administration officials are blaming Snowden while some lawmakers complain disingenuously that the administration kept them out of the loop.“All of us are sort of asking what in the world has gone on” a seemingly bewildered Eric Cantor (R-Va.) the House majority leader alleged Monday on CBS’s “This Morning.”Host Norah O’Donnell asked whether he had known about the program before the leaks.1 of 156 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × The best editorial cartoons of 2013 (so far) View Photos A collection of cartoons from around the country. Caption A collection of cartoons from around the country. Rob Rogers/Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Wait 1 second to continue.“Well” Cantor replied “there are a variety of — of classified programs that exist for us to again guard against a terrorist threat. And . . . ”Asked whether the Obama administration’s surveillance went further than the George W. Bush administration’s Cantor said that “these are questions we don’t know the answers to.”“How do you not know the answer?” O’Donnell asked.Good question. All 535 members of Congress had authorization to learn all about the programs. Senators even received a written invitation in 2011 to view a classified report. Likewise Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) a former chairman of the Homeland Security Committee said Monday that members “could have gotten a briefing whenever they wanted to.”But apparently few bothered. Worse lawmakers quashed efforts to allow even modest public disclosure of the broad contours of the program. Steven Aftergood who runs the Federation of American Scientists’ Project on Government Secrecy lists the various ways in which the administration Congress and the courts denied the public any right to know:The Justice Department and the DNI promised a new effort to declassify opinions issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court; Justice official Lisa Monaco now Obama’s counterterrorism director said all significant FISA rulings would be reviewed for declassification. But no new opinions were declassified under the initiative.The House last year turned back attempts to require public reports on the general outlines of the government’s surveillance programs. The various disclosure proposals offered by Democratic Reps. Bobby Scott (Va.) Jerrold Nadler (N.Y.) and Sheila Jackson Lee (Tex.) were defeated by the Judiciary Committee.In the Senate amendments to provide modest disclosures and declassifications offered by Wyden and fellow Democratic Sens. Jeff Merkley (Ore.) and Mark Udall (Colo.) during the FISA renewal in December were all defeated.The FISA court itself colluded in the secrecy. After senators asked the court to provide declassified summaries of its decisions the chief FISA judge Reggie B. Walton responded with a letter on March 27 citing “serious obstacles” to the request.“It was a shoddy performance all around” Aftergood said Monday. “The pervasive secrecy on this topic created an information vacuum. If congressional oversight was not going to fill it in it turned out leaks would. That’s not the optimal solution.”Not optimal but probably inevitable. Officials who denied the public a responsible debate on surveillance will now have a debate on Snowden’s terms — and there’s no use in bellyaching about it.Twitter: @MilbankRead more from Dana Milbank’s archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.,1

None of the Republican groups have said their applications were rejected. Progress Texas another of the organizations faced the same lines of questioning as the Tea Party groups from the same IRS office that issued letters to the Republican-friendly applicants. A third group Clean Elections Texas which supports public funding of campaigns also received IRS inquiries.Missing from much coverage is the relevant recent history—the role of the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision and how it prompted a deluge of requests from new organizations seeking tax-exempt status under tax code Section 501(c)(4) as “social welfare” organizations—despite the fact that many of these are blatantly political operations.decision and how it prompted a deluge of requests from new organizations seeking tax-exempt status under tax code Section 501(c)(4) as “social welfare” organizations—despite the fact that many of these are blatantly political operations. Congress requires the IRS to review every application for tax-exempt status to weed out organizations that are partisan political or that generate private gain. Congress has imposed this requirement on the IRS and its predecessor agencies since 1913.The maelstrom over the revelation that the IRS targeted anti-tax Tea Party groups applying for tax exempt status for scrutiny is showing no signs of slowing down with Republicans seeing their chance to milk a scandal for political purposes. But while the politics is heating up some important context is emerging like the fact that liberal groups were targeted as well  and in fact the only group to have its application denied was a liberal group.The IRS released a statement late Tuesday admitting that it had pooled together the applications of groups that were politically active and incorrectly used the names of some of the groups—a ""minority"" of them—as the basis for targeting them. Which David Cay Johnston at the reminds readers is the IRS's job.Those are just two of the salient points Johnston makes to give the critical context behind this scandal. He also points out that the IRS is tasked with the vague and mushy directive to distinguish between groups are ""primarily engaged"" in politics versus those that are primarily engaged in ""social welfare"" and getting to that distinction is a challenge for an agency deluged by applications post-and which has had its budget slashed by 17 percent per capita in the last decade. The agency processed501(c)(4) applications in 2012.The other point he makes which we're not hearing frequently or loudly enough in the response to the kerfuffle is a real scandal: ""the social welfare tax exemption is being used by existing 501(c)(4) organizations including some very large ones to promote partisan political interests—the very activity Congress has explicitly prohibited for a century."" In other words Karl Rove and Crossroads.This is a serious issue one deserving of investigation. But Republicans could be biting off more than they can chew if it causes a bright light to be shone on how politically partisan organizations like Rove's are exploiting the law.",0
539,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate overwhelmingly confirmed President Barack Obama's choice of five-term Sen. John Kerry to be secretary of state with Republicans and Democrats praising him as the ideal successor to Hillary Rodham Clinton.The vote Tuesday was 94-3. One senator — Kerry — voted present and accepted congratulations from colleagues on the Senate floor. The roll call came just hours after the Senate Foreign Relations Committee unanimously approved the man who has led the panel for the past four years.No date has been set for Kerry's swearing-in but in a letter to Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick Kerry says his resignation is effective at 4 p.m. Friday. The State Departments plans a welcoming ceremony for Kerry on Monday.Obama tapped Kerry 69 the son of a diplomat decorated Vietnam veteran and 2004 Democratic presidential candidate to succeed Clinton who is stepping down after four years. The Massachusetts Democrat who had pined for the job but was passed over in 2009 has served as Obama's unofficial envoy smoothing fractious ties with Afghanistan and Pakistan.""Sen. Kerry will need no introduction to the world's political and military leaders and will begin Day One fully conversant not only with the intricacies of U.S. foreign policy but able to act on a multitude of international stages"" said Sen. Bob Menendez D-N.J. who will succeed Kerry as committee chairman.Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee the panel's top Republican called Kerry ""a realist"" who will deal with unrest in Egypt civil war in Syria the threat of al-Qaida-linked groups in Africa and Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons.Kerry a forceful proponent of climate change legislation also will have a say in whether the United States moves ahead on the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada a divisive issue that has roiled environmentalists.Obama had nominated Kerry after Susan Rice the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations removed her name from consideration following criticism from Republicans over her initial comments about the attacks on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi Libya.Story continuesVoting against Kerry were three Republicans — Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma and John Cornyn and Ted Cruz of Texas. Absent from the vote were Sens. Patty Murray D-Wash. and John Hoeven R-N.D.""Sen. Kerry has a long history of liberal positions that are not consistent with a majority of Texans"" Cornyn said in a statement. The senator is up for re-election next year and could face a tea party challenge.Kerry's smooth path to the nation's top diplomatic job stands in stark contrast to the harsher treatment for Obama's other national security nominees — Chuck Hagel to be defense secretary and John Brennan to be CIA director.Hagel the former two-term Republican senator from Nebraska faces strong opposition from some of his onetime GOP colleagues who question his support for reductions in the nuclear arsenal and cuts in defense spending. Lawmakers also have questioned whether he is sufficiently supportive of Israel and strongly opposed to any outreach to Iran.Democrats have rallied for Hagel and he has the announced support of at least a dozen members in advance of his confirmation hearing on Thursday. Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi will support Hagel a spokesman said Tuesday making him the first Republican to signal he will vote for the nomination.Six Republicans have said they would vote against him with some opposing Obama's choice even before the president's announcement.Brennan faces questions from the GOP about White House leaks of classified information and from Democrats about the administration's use of drones.Sen. Lindsey Graham R-S.C. threatened to block the nomination of both men until he gets more answers from the Obama administration about the assault on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Libya that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.Graham who earlier this month signaled he would delay Brennan's pick said in an interview Monday night with Fox News' ""On the Record"" the he would ""absolutely"" block Hagel unless Defense Secretary Leon Panetta testifies about the attack in Benghazi Libya.Clinton testified for more than five hours last Wednesday before the House and Senate but that wasn't sufficient for Graham.""Hillary Clinton got away with murder in my view"" he said. ""She said they had a clear-eyed view of the threats. How could you have a clear-eyed of the threats in Benghazi when you didn't know about the ambassador's cable coming back from Libya?""Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin D-Mich. told reporters Tuesday that a hearing with Panetta on Libya is planned though the date is uncertain. Graham welcomed that news and said he would not thwart a committee vote on the nomination.""Happy as a clam. News to me"" said Graham who met with Hagel for 20 minutes on Tuesday.Pentagon spokesman George Little said Panetta had not responded yet to the request but that the department has been forthcoming with information. He insisted that the Hagel confirmation process move as quickly as possible.Two former chairmen of the committee — Democrat Sam Nunn of Georgia and Republican John Warner of Virginia — plan to introduce Hagel according to officials close to the confirmation process. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the committee has not formally made an announcement.As a White House emissary Kerry has tamped down diplomatic fires for Obama. He also has stepped ahead of the administration on a handful of crises. He joined Sen. John McCain R-Ariz. as an early proponent of a more aggressive policy toward Libya pushing for using military forces to impose a ""no-fly zone"" over Libya as Moammar Gadhafi's forces killed rebels and other citizens. He was one of the early voices calling for Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to step down as revolution roiled the nation two years ago.During his tenure Kerry has pushed for reducing the number of nuclear weapons shepherding a U.S.-Russia treaty through the Senate in December 2010 and has cast climate change as a national security threat joining forces with Republicans on legislation that faced too many obstacles to win congressional passage.He has led delegations to Syria and met a few times with President Bashar Assad now a pariah in U.S. eyes after months of civil war and bloodshed as the government looks to put down a people's rebellion. Figuring out an end-game for the Middle East country would demand all of Kerry's skills.The selection of Kerry closes a political circle with Obama. In 2004 it was White House hopeful Kerry who asked a largely unknown Illinois state senator to deliver the keynote address at the Democratic convention in Boston handing the national stage to Obama. Kerry lost that election to President George W. Bush. Four years later Obama was the White House hopeful who succeeded where Kerry had failed.___Follow Donna Cassata on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/DonnaCassataAP",1

Peterson founder of the Jack in the Box Inc. fast-food chain. She is now virtually broke living with a sister.O'Connor walked across the courtroom with a cane appearing frail and struggling to maintain composure at one point as her attorney wrapped his arm around her shoulder and placed his hand on her head.At a news conference she said she always intended to repay the foundation and appeared to blame her behavior on a brain tumor that was diagnosed in 2011.""There are two Maureens — Maureen No. 1 and Maureen No. 2"" said O'Connor who declined to take questions. ""Maureen No. 2 is the Maureen who did not know she had a tumor growing in her brain.""O'Connor's game of choice was video poker at casinos in San Diego Las Vegas and Atlantic City N.J. Her attorney Eugene Iredale said she played for hours at a time.She won about $1 billion from 2000 to 2009 according to winnings that casinos reported to the Internal Revenue Service but lost even more. Iredale said her net gambling losses topped $13 million.News of O'Connor's gambling troubles and financial ruin elicited sympathy in her hometown. Magistrate Judge David Bartick told her that she left ""a very strong legacy in the city of San Diego.""The U.S. attorney's office said O'Connor's medical condition influenced the decision to strike a deal saying it may have been impossible to bring the case to trial. The tumor was removed but doctors submitted letters detailing significant ailments.""Maureen O'Connor was a selfless public official who contributed much to the well-being of San Diego"" said U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy. ""However no figure regardless of how much good they've done or how much they've given to charity can escape criminal liability with impunity.""O'Connor the eighth of 13 children whose father was a boxer and nightclub owner and mother was a registered nurse was elected to the City Council three years after graduating from San Diego State University. She was mayor from 1986 to 1992 San Diego's only Democratic leader over a four-decade span. She promoted community policing championed the arts and oversaw completion of a downtown convention center.O'Connor began gambling around 2001 as she struggled with pain and loneliness from the death of her husband from leukemia in 1994 and the passing of several close friends said Iredale who called it ""grief gambling"" in a court filing. Within four years she was betting heavily.O'Connor acknowledged taking $2.1 million from the R.P. Foundation between September 2008 and March 2009 to pay gambling debts wager more and cover living costs. She was one of three trustees of the foundation a nonprofit organization that supported the Alzheimer's Association City of Hope San Diego Hospice and other charities.Her annual gambling winnings peaked at more than $200 million said Phillip Halpern an assistant U.S. attorney. Prosecutors said they didn't know exactly how much she lost but that she also borrowed money from friends and sold property to gamble.O'Connor sold a home in tony La Jolla for $2.5 million in 2010 that is down the street from former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney.She also sold the Heritage House Hotel in the Northern California coastal town of Mendocino for $7.5 million in 2005 to investors who defaulted Iredale said.

542,Story highlights NEW: In midst of controversies Obama pushes Congress on student loans Obama administration faces congressional probes of IRS Benghazi AP Republicans say the issues reflect government gone wild Democrats contend GOP foes politicize the process(CNN) —When President Barack Obama headed to the Jersey Shore this week to tout the recovery effort from Superstorm Sandy congressional Republicans sought to keep the nation’s focus on Washington.On the same day Obama played “Touchdown Fever” with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on the Point Pleasant boardwalk and urged Americans to come spend money in the devastated region House GOP committee leaders ensured that a series of controversies dominating the start of the president’s second term remained in the headlines.Obama quoted from the Tom Waits song “Jersey Girl” popularized by local hero Bruce Springsteen while GOP officials announced subpoenas of State Department records involving last year’s deadly Benghazi terrorist attack questioned if Attorney General Eric Holder lied to Congress about cracking down on journalists and announced another congressional hearing on IRS targeting of conservative groups.And on Friday Obama stood in the Rose Garden to push Congress to extend student loan rates that are set to double on July 1 if the White House and Republicans can’t strike a deal.It’s all part of a high-stakes showdown over political messaging with the White House trying to shift the focus from the controversies that Republicans seek to emphasize in their efforts to retain their House majority and perhaps win control of the Senate in next year’s congressional elections.“Voters react against what they perceive to be excess and overkill” said Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway who noted that recent polls show the public believes one of the current controversies – the IRS targeting of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status – amounted to government overreach.“Any political party that overreaches usually gets slapped back by the public” she added referring to losses suffered by parties in power in mid-term elections in 1994 2006 and 2010.The GOP narrative depicts a government gone wild with party leaders and strategists accusing the Obama administration of routinely abusing its powers. To bolster their argument they lump the three controversies together in an effort to create a sweeping example of leaders avoiding accountability and responsibility.Alex Wong/Getty Images“Benghazi. The IRS. AP phone records. The failures for which Barack Obama will be remembered are not just those of one man or one administration” Republican strategist Alex Castellanos a CNN contributor recently wrote in an opinion piece. “They are the failures of an old idea – that big old dumb top-down factory style government can manage the complexities of modern times.”Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin the 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee complained of “an arrogant abuse of power” by the president.“Now in his second term now that he’s implementing his agenda we are seeing big government in practice” the House Budget Committee chairman said Wednesday on Fox.Asked if the controversies would bring Republican victories in next year’s congressional elections to take control of the Senate while retaining their majority in the House Ryan said it was “just way too premature to make a comment like that.”White House emphasizes business as usualFor his part Obama seemed to acknowledge his political troubles at a fundraiser on Wednesday night in Chicago telling supporters that “sometimes we take a bad turn sometimes we make mistakes.”At the same time the president complained of “obstructionism for the sake of obstructionism” by political foes who appeared interested “only in scoring political points or placating a base as opposed to trying to advance the interests of the American people.”“We’ve got to figure out a way to work around that” he continued declaring that the solution would be for Democrats to regain majority control in the House next year.Obama’s schedule this week demonstrated how the White House took a “business as usual” approach that emphasized low-risk issues for the president such as Tuesday’s visit to New Jersey for a bipartisan review of recovery efforts with Christie a leading Republican.The joint appearance benefited both men by portraying them as reasonable leaders able to work with political foes on major issues such as responding to a crisis like last year’s storm.Other events on the president’s agenda included two Chicago fundraisers and remarks at an Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month Celebration at the White House all following last week’s major speech on security issues including U.S. drone policy and closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility that houses terror suspects.Despite the White House efforts to shift the focus from the Washington controversies Wednesday’s briefing with reporters by chief spokesman Jay Carney showed the difficulty.While the first questions were about other matters – a reported drone strike the Syrian civil war and cyber-security issues with China – CNN’s Jim Acosta then asked about GOP accusations that Holder may have lied to Congress about the secret subpoenas and search warrants obtained by the Justice Department in recent years for information from journalists involved in reporting classified information.Reporters from NBC CBS and Fox quickly followed up on the same topic forcing Carney to defend Holder and reiterate Obama’s confidence in him.On Thursday White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters aboard Air Force One from Chicago that Obama would later attend his annual hurricane season briefing. He then faced more questions about Holder with Earnest expressing Obama’s confidence that the controversies would not affect the attorney general’s ability to do his job.GOP singles out HolderRepublicans have taken particular aim at Holder an old nemesis from his days in the Clinton administration who has been a political lightning rod in the Obama administration.Olivier Douliery - Pool/Getty ImagesHe was cited for contempt of Congress by House Republicans last year in a dispute over documents related to the botched “Fast and Furious” gun-walking operation. Holder rejected the vote boycotted by most House Democrats as political theater.Critics now seek to link him to two cases stemming from Justice Department investigations of classified leaks – one involving secret subpoenas last year of phone records of Associated Press journalists and the other about subpoenas and search warrants obtained in secret three years ago for phone records e-mails and security badge details of Fox correspondent James Rosen.Some Republicans attempt to group the classified leaks cases with the other controversies – IRS targeting of conservative groups and erroneous talking points from the administration four days after the terrorist attack in Benghazi Libya last September that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans.“I think it is time for Mr. Holder to step aside” Republican Rep. Ron DeSantis of Florida told Fox News on Wednesday. “We need a new attorney general especially with all of these matters that are now going to need investigation from the IRS to the DOJ treatment of reporters. I just don’t think he is in a position where he can do that in a way that the American people expect.”Obama and Democrats joined Republicans in condemning the IRS targeting which is under investigation by congressional committees as well as Holder’s Department of Justice.The classified leaks investigations also raised concern among Democrats including Obama who ordered Holder to conduct a review of how the government investigates such cases.However Democratic strategist Stephanie Cutter a CNN political contributor described Republican calls for Holder to resign as overkill noting that GOP legislators had demanded an investigation into classified leaks in the first place.“I think that if the president took action every time a House Republican criticized a member of his Cabinet we’d have a pretty empty government” Cutter said when asked if Holder was proving a liability to Obama. “… For average Americans they’re not really paying attention to this and they’re wondering you know why shouldn’t the Department of Justice investigate you know intelligence leaks about some of our most pressing national security issues?”Public responds to IRSA Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday appeared to back up some of Cutter’s assertion.According to the survey 44% of registered voters responded that the IRS probe of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status was the most important of the controversies facing the Obama administration while 24% said the handling of the Benghazi attack was the biggest concern. Only 15% called the Justice Department’s seizure of journalists’ phone records as the most important.By contrast 73% of respondents said the economy was a higher priority than the three controversies according to the survey. However it also showed that more than three-quarters of respondents wanted a special prosecutor – rather than Holder – to investigate the IRS targeting.To liberal political analyst Earl Ofari Hutchinson Republicans have attacked Holder as part of a broader strategy to tarnish the administration.“Typing Holder as the font of secrecy manipulation and wrongdoing in the Obama administration will be played and replayed in the run-up to the 2014 elections” Hutchinson wrote Thursday on his website. “The aim will be to paint Holder as an incompetent conniving political hack who supposedly typifies the poor and untrustworthy judgment of Obama in picking his political appointees.”Conway the GOP pollster argued that the controversies all started with problematic acts by the administration.“It’s an advantage to the party out of power if the party in power is seen to be obfuscating or hiding the truth” she said noting that “these are not investigations that began in (Republican House Speaker) John Boehner’s office.”Jonathan Turley a George Washington University constitutional lawyer noted that most recent presidents faced accusations if not outright evidence of scandal in their second terms.In the Obama administration Turley said Holder serves the role of “sin-eater” or “people that would take your sins away for a price.”“Holder is the ultimate sin-eater in the beltway” Turley argued on CNN. “He protects the president and he has an important use in that sense.”CNN’s Ashley Killough and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.,1
543,For much to happen in Washington there needs to be a majority or at least a large plurality of voters who trust the notion that Washington activism will have a positive effect. The current scandals combined with President Obama’s lethargy and lack of planning have driven trust in government to a recent new low. This strengthens the hand of those who don’t want anything to pass in Congress. An AP/GFK poll from April 2013 shows that only 21 percent of Americans “trust the government in Washington to do what’s right” either “just about always” or “most” of the time. Senator Marco Rubio recognizes this now-pervasive sentiment referring to “the lack of trust in the federal government and in particular in this administration” when discussing border security concerns in the immigration reform bill.Ironically it’s entirely possible that sequestration will end up being the most consequential piece of legislation that passes in President Obama’s second term. Neither side really wanted it to go into effect and since the consequences are mostly passing unnoticed it’s unlikely that it will be substantially amended.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe president has lost any kind of momentum he may have had coming into his second term and with his administration on the rocks it doesn’t seem likely that he will gain any traction in the coming months. My friend and former Clinton Administration official Doug Sosnik hit the nail on the head when he said “There’s not a single member of either party who fears paying a political price for not falling in line with the president making it even more difficult to get members to cast difficult votes.”,1

And so the across-the-board cuts of the so-called ""sequester"" - which both Republicans and Democrats have said they oppose - took effect Friday night after President Barack Obama and Republican leaders failed to agree on a way to replace them with targeted spending reductions.Up until the final few days before Friday when the reductions began because of a law enacted in 2011 constituents urged some begged lawmakers to avert them.The cuts threaten the U.S. economic recovery could disrupt federal services from airports to national parks and may force furloughs of hundreds of thousands of federal workers and employees of federal contractors the administration says.""They want to kill us all"" Senator Orrin Hatch a Utah Republican said of his constituents.Laura Zayner a senior officer with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security at Chicago's O'Hare Airport was among 400 federal workers facing possible furloughs who came to Washington last week to lobby Congress.""We consider the furlough a slap in the face. We take it personally"" Zayner said. ""We are not picking sides Democrats or Republicans. But we want them to do their jobs and stop the cuts.""John Kelshaw who works with the Internal Revenue Service came to town from New Jersey. He and a few other federal workers met with Republican Representative John Runyan.""We told him that a lot of our people live paycheck to paycheck. We said 'Give us a break'"" Kelshaw said. He said Runyan of New Jersey listened but made no commitments.WHO'S TO BLAME?Polls so far show most Americans blame Republicans rather than Obama and his Democrats for the standoff. But that could change.Republicans insist that any deficit-reduction replacement deal include only spending cuts. Democrats want a mix of spending cuts and tax increases.According to a February 28 Gallup survey 56 percent of those polled thought the cuts will damage the economy. The feeling crossed party lines Gallup reported with 64 percent of Republicans and 51 percent of Democrats agreeing they would inflict economic pain.Democratic Senator Mark Pryor said his constituents in Arkansas routinely ask him ""'Why can't you guys work it out?'""Pryor said he tells them ""Nobody has clean hands on this.""Both sides seem to size up any issue on a basis of who gets the political advantage he said. ""If someone suddenly came up with a cure to cancer the question in Washington would be 'Is this good or bad for Obama?'""The president on Friday said of the cuts ""This is not a win for anybody. This is a loss for the American people.""Hatch of Utah said he recently told his state legislature that he expected the federal government to impose the sweeping cuts. ""A number of them stood up and said maybe that's the only way we are going get any real reduction in spending"" he said.On the other side Representative Luis Gutierrez a Chicago Democrat who won an 11th term last year with more than 80 percent of the vote said his constituents ""tell me 'Keep on fighting Luis keep on fighting.'""Representative Scott Rigell a Virginia Republican whose district includes the shipbuilding yards in Newport News that are likely to be hit hard by cuts in military spending was dismayed by the untargeted reductions.Rigell got a letter from a constituent last month that read in part ""My husband a project manager for the defense industry went to work this morning to lay off half of his workforce because of sequestration.""In an interview Rigell said ""When I think they (shipyard workers) could lose their jobs because of the dysfunction in Washington ... this is not acceptable to me.""""I've been at that shipyard. Some of hardest working folks I know. They're coming in at 5:30 a.m. with a lunch bucket and making $35000 a year and wondering if they'll have a job.""",0
545,"Republicans on Saturday stepped up their call for President Obama to take the lead in negotiations to avert roughly $85 billion in automatic cuts to the military and other government spending next month by replacing the cuts with less drastic reductions.Alabama Republican Rep. Martha Roby said the president is responsible for the cuts because his administration proposed the plan known as sequester during the 2011 debt-limit negotiations.“In his State of the Union address President Obama himself admitted that these cuts are a really bad idea” Roby said Saturday in the weekly Republican address. “What the president failed to mention was sequester was his idea.”Roby chairwoman of a House Armed Services subcommittee is among several Republican lawmakers including Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn who after Obama's speech Tuesday is saying how the across-the-board cuts to the military would impact bases including those in their home districts.Roby said her district’s Fort Rucker the Army’s primary flight-training base would lose 500 students training to be combat aviators.“The numbers are astounding” said Roby who voted against the August 2011 Budget Control Act. “This is just one set of cuts at one base.”The consequences of the sequester agreement were intended to be so drastic that the parties were expected to reach a deal before the cuts started.Roby is urging the president to consider two proposals by the Republican-controlled House that call for replacing sequester with more targeted cuts.However the March 1 deadline is fast approaching with no deal as the president is playing golf in Florida during the long President’s Day weekend and Congress is on a nine-day break.“Sequestration is going to take place” Blackburn told CNBC on Wednesday.Leaders of the Democrat-controlled Senate announced a plan Thursday to avoid the cuts. However the plan a mix of spending cuts and tax increases on the country’s highest earners is not expected to pass. It further highlights the continuing debate on whether to solve the country’s fiscal problems with less spending or more taxes.“I disagree with Republicans who think we should do that by making even bigger cuts to things like education and job training; Medicare and Social Security benefits” Obama said Saturday during his weekly address. “That would force our senior citizens and working families to bear the burden of deficit reduction while the wealthiest are asked to do nothing more.”Sequester would result in roughly $85 billion in cuts this year from the federal budget with $46 billion from the Pentagon. No so-called ""safety-net"" programs would be cut. But the economy could lose an estimate 750000 jobs as a result of sequester which cuts $1.2 trillion in spending over the next decade.“President Obama and Senate Democrats see sequester as another opportunity to push through another tax hike” Roby said. “The ink has barely dried on the tax hikes the president pushed through in January.”",0
546,"Story highlights Gloria Borger: How could the President not have known of the Obamacare website flaws? She says Obama prefers a ""no-drama"" White House in which people stay in their lanes Staffers are not encouraged to bring the President bad news she says Borger: There was no rollout czar for Obamacare; everyone stayed in their silo(CNN) —As the story of the Obamacare website fiasco unfolds senior administration aides tell me that the President is “mad frustrated and angry.”Mad that his signature legislative achievement is stuck at the gate frustrated that he’s running out of time to fix it and angry that he’s got a second-term agenda now going nowhere. He’s so furious in fact that he stepped out of character to vent to an assembled group of top aides saying he would have delayed the website if he had known it was a mess.By Thursday the president was venting publicly. “Had I been informed I wouldn’t be going out saying boy this is going to be great. You know I’m accused of a lot of things but I don’t think I’m stupid enough to go around saying this is going to be like shopping on Amazon or Travelocity a week before the website opens if I thought that it wasn’t going to work.”All of which begs the real question: How could he not have known?It’s a real head-scratcher. Most powerful man in the world. Most important issue. Most politically explosive particularly coming on the heels of the government shutdown. Consider the context: Republicans had just tried to defund Obamacare and they lost in a heap of public humiliation. So the rollout of Obamacare had to be really impressive because the Republicans had to be proven wrong.CNN Gloria BorgerAnd yet as the dry runs continued to produce red flags – over and over – the President remained in his steely cocoon. If this were the presidency of George W. Bush or Ronald Reagan the obvious theories would abound: The chief executive is disengaged. Or incurious. Or worse. But since Obama is none of the above what gives?This much is clear after speaking with both past and present senior administration officials: No one was really in charge so no one knew for sure how bad the overall picture was. What’s more and – perhaps most telling – no one wanted even to hint to the President that this techno-savvy administration possibly had a website stuck in say 1995. “People don’t like to tell him bad news” says an ex-White House staffer. “Part of it is the no-drama culture.”Oh that. The infamous no-drama Obama credo: no panic no drama. “No drama is attractive to people except there are times when people actually should light their hair on fire” says one former senior administration official. “That would have been a very good thing.”Indeed. People who have served in top jobs at the White House seem to agree on one thing: a President who wants to get at the truth has to understand the extent of his own isolation. And then establish a zone of immunity for truth-tellers.That of course presumes that the top staff inside the White House knew the full truth. And that probably wasn’t the case. Again you ask how can that be? Answer: The operation resembled the proverbial blind men and the elephant parable: Everyone seemed to touch a part of it but no one could really see the whole picture or disaster coming right at them.“It’s not that someone had an envelope with a note in it saying here comes the second-term crisis” an ex-top White House staffer says. “They were thinking there were some bugs they would be fixed; these are smart people.”They may be smart but it appears they had no singular leader. No rollout czar. They had health care wonks and tech wonks and political wonks and even a presidential wonk but no put-it-all-together-and-make-sure-it-all-works wonks.And maybe no truth-telling wonks who would have warned the president that it was a no-no to promise that people could keep their health care policies.Everyone it seems lived in his own silo. And that’s where they stayed.This is a President says one admirer “who likes everyone to stay in his lane.” Which begs the question: Whose lane was it to say the website wasn’t working? The probability is that the information filtered to a bunch of different people in a bunch of different lanes.Sure the stay-in-your-lane theory of operation is important to a well-run White House but here’s the flip side if it’s implemented too literally: If you hear something outside your purview that is bad you may not want to report it higher. Why? “Everyone thinks if it isn’t in my lane and I talk about it I’m being a tattletale” says one ex-administration official. “That would be discouraged as bad behavior in this current White House.” (An exception some point out ex-chief of staff Rahm Emanuel who “encouraged people to contradict each other.” To put it mildly Rahm was pro-drama.)Which brings us to the President who isn’t. And if you aren’t 100% sure that the website is a mess – because no one is actually in charge to tell the White House with any certainty – what is there to bring to the President? Reports of some bad tests? Bugs? Fixes that are being made?“Nobody is trying to create drama angst and anxiety” says an ex-White House official. “And it’s hard to go in there and say ‘Well I don’t think this is going to work.’ ”So the irony. All the effort to spare the drama created a huge theatrical mess all of its own. The reviews are lousy and now the unhappy leading man is stewing centerstage.Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gloria Borger.",1
547,At a press conference on Monday President Obama addressed the Benghazi talking points criticism and said “We don’t have time to be playing these kinds of political games here in Washington.” (The Washington Post)At a press conference on Monday President Obama addressed the Benghazi talking points criticism and said “We don’t have time to be playing these kinds of political games here in Washington.” (The Washington Post)After answering questions Monday morning about two of the controversies that have undermined his administration President Obama flew off to New York to raise money for the Democratic Party. There before partisan donors he reflected on his second term and said he will continue to reach out to Republicans. “I sure want to do some governing” he explained.Obama’s words suggest that he believes there is a way to compartmentalize the business of his second term: legislative and other business here scandals over there. But things are too messy for that right now. A politician who has counted good luck as part of his skill set will need all the breaks he can muster to pull off that bit of political jujitsu.Even in the best of times Obama’s outreach to Republicans produced little in return — and these are no longer close to the best of times. The question is whether the barely civil relationship between the White House and the opposition party has been irreparably damaged. A related question is how much the controversies will weaken Obama’s standing with the public. Together the answers will decide how effectively he can govern.It is too early to draw any broad conclusions about the long-term damage to Obama’s presidency from the news that the Internal Revenue Service targeted conservative groups and that the Justice Department collected two months of phone records from Associated Press reporters and editors. But in the moment these controversies — along with the ongoing congressional investigation of the attacks in Benghazi Libya — have created major challenges for the administration.The president and his advisers have tried to insulate the White House from the actions of the IRS and the Justice Department claiming ignorance. The IRS officials argued Friday is quasi-independent. It took the president three days to express his outrage at the agency’s actions. As for the Justice Department’s leak investigation White House officials said Monday night that it was a department decision that was not forwarded to the president.Those are temporary responses that probably will not be sufficient over time. The White House may have known nothing about either but both are now the president’s problem. And both reflect questions about the administration that predate the revelations of the past few days.The tea party movement has been a political nemesis for Obama since the first year of his presidency. The movement helped turn the battle over health care into one of the most divisive fights of his presidency. The political potency of the grass-roots activists who rallied behind tea party banners helped deliver the worst midterm-election defeat to a party holding the White House in 70 years.The president and his advisers may not have known anything about IRS targeting of tea party groups for greater scrutiny but the abuse of power confirmed complaints by conservatives and GOP lawmakers that the practice was taking place and impressions among conservatives that the administration is truly hostile to the tea party movement. Holding those responsible accountable will be only part of Obama’s challenge in responding.Less is known about the Justice Department’s leak investigation. It was carried out by an administration that came into office talking about the importance of civil liberties but whose record has been a disappointment to civil libertarians. No one can recall anything as far-reaching as what the Justice Department apparently did in secretly gathering information about the work of AP journalists.Obama showed his greatest passion Monday when he denounced the GOP-led inquiry of the killing of four Americans in a terrorist attack in Benghazi on Sept. 11 2012. That partisan politics are involved in the congressional investigation is certainly the case. In addition to whatever enmity is felt toward the Obama administration over its handling of the aftermath GOP leaders see former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton for what she is which is a potentially formidable presidential candidate in 2016.Obama argued that the current focus on administration talking points is a political sideshow. As others including The Post’s Glenn Kessler have noted the multiple alterations in those talking points appeared to reflect an internal turf war between the State Department and the CIA. Obama argued that it was hardly a coverup.Given the timing of the attack in Benghazi which occurred in the heat of a presidential race White House officials worked to keep the issue from becoming part of the campaign debate — and GOP nominee Mitt Romney’s maladroit handling of it at the start provided convenient cover for the White House. Obama’s campaign put Romney on the defensive rather than the opposite although the deaths of the four Americans — and the subsequent security lapses that were enumerated — were a major stain on the administration.As questions were raised White House officials avoided drawing conclusions about the origins of the attacks. Even as the head of the National Counterterrorism Center testified that what happened at the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi was a terrorist attack the president continued to resist labeling it as such. For whatever reason the administration’s semantic gamesmanship contributed to what the president now dismisses as a sideshow.Obama is early into his second term but it has not gone as planned. His gun-control initiative was blocked. Prospects for a grand bargain on the budget are problematic. Immigration reform is moving forward slowly in the Senate and faces uncertainty in the House although administration officials remain optimistic that Congress eventually will approve a bill.On Monday night in New York the president said “I’m going to do everything I can over the next 31 / 2 years to continue to reach out to my Republican friends on the other side of the aisle. . . . I want to get some stuff done. I don’t have a lot of time.”He will have to spend some of that precious time trying to clean up unexpected messes that have landed on his desk. How seriously off track his administration is will depend in large part on how skillfully Obama handles what is before him.,0
548,It’s past time for the media to begin asking President Obama tough questions about the IRS conservative targeting scandal. After all he was involved publicly from the beginning.Last Friday the American Center for Law and Justice (where I serve as Chief Counsel) filed its Second Amended Complaint against the United States the IRS and a legion of IRS officials. This Complaint in which we represent 41 organizations in 22 states presents perhaps the most complete story yet of the IRS conservative targeting scandal.And it is an ugly story indeed.What was sold to the American public as a low-level scandal perpetrated by a few rogue employees – a scandal stopped after senior officials became aware and asserted control – is now (to borrow a Watergate phrase) “no longer operative.”[pullquote]Instead we detail a long-running assault on the Tea Party beginning shortly after its emergence in 2009 that is empowered encouraged and orchestrated not only by senior IRS officials in Washington but also through outright targeting by the White House Congressional Democrats and the mainstream media.In fact the IRS was doing little more than focusing its attention exactly where the president of the United States told it to focus – on the groups the president himself identified as a “threat to democracy.”Consider President Obama’s aggressive public statements – made just as we now know senior IRS officials were intentionally and aggressively scrutinizing conservative groups’ applications for tax exemption.On August 9 2010 the president warned of “attack ads run by shadowy groups with harmless-sounding names” during his weekly radio address. The President said: We don’t know who’s behind these ads and we don’t know who’s paying for them . . . you don’t know if it’s a foreign controlled corporation. ... The only people who don’t want to disclose the truth are people with something to hide.”On September 16 2010 President Obama once again warned that some unidentified “foreign-controlled entity” could be providing “millions of dollars” for “attack ads.” Less than one week later he complained that “nobody knows” the identities of the individuals who support conservative groups.On September 22 2010 President Obama warned of groups opposing his policies “pos[ing] as non-for-profit social and welfare trade groups” and he claimed such groups were “guided by seasoned Republican political operatives” and potentially supported by some unidentified “foreign controlled entity.”On October 14 2010 President Obama called organizations with “benign sounding” names “a problem for democracy”; the next week he complained about individuals who “hide behind those front groups” called such groups a “threat to our democracy” and claimed such groups were engaged in “unsupervised” spending.Next consider the IRS’s actions following those statements. Not only did the IRS continue its targeting it issued broad questionnaires that made unconstitutionally-intrusive inquiries designed to get answers to exactly the questions President Obama posed.Who are your donors?What is the political activity of your family and associates?What are the passwords for your websites?After all according to the president you’re only afraid to answer these questions if “you’ve got something to hide.”The demagoguery is breathtaking. Not only does he raise the wholly-unsubstantiated possibility of shadowy “foreign” involvement in the Tea Party groups a charge incredible on its face but he goes the extra mile of calling such groups a “threat to our democracy.”When the president of the United States declares these groups a “threat to our democracy” is it any surprise that his enthusiastic supporters (and donors) within the IRS responded with an unprecedented campaign of selective targeting intimidation and governmental intrusion?One grows weary of stating the obvious but if President Bush had declared a specific category of citizen groups a “threat to democracy” potentially run by “political operatives” or “foreign-controlled” and the IRS launched an unprecedented campaign of targeting and intrusive questioning the mainstream media would have been relentless not only in its independent investigations but in its calls for accountability – at the highest levels.Was the president of the United States involved in the IRS scandal? He was the one who identified the targets – in the most public manner possible.A president singling out citizens groups for targeting and intrusive questioning merely because he dislikes their message and fears their political influence?Now that is a “threat to democracy.”,0
549,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate Republican leader who last year accused the Obama administration of Nixon-style dirty tricks said Friday the Internal Revenue Service's targeting of conservative groups is part of a broader government assault on free speech.Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky seized on the spate of controversies besetting the White House saying Americans are recognizing a pattern of attack on First Amendment rights across government agencies the administration President Barack Obama's congressional allies left-wing groups and public employee unions.""As serious as the IRS scandal is what we're dealing with here is larger than the actions of one agency or any group of employees"" McConnell who is up for re-election next year said in a speech to the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""This administration has institutionalized the practice of pitting bureaucrats against the very people they're supposed to be serving and it needs to stop.""White House spokesman Jay Carney said the charge leveled by McConnell was ""demonstrably bogus.""""As I'm sure the minority leader in the Senate is aware the independent inspector general has testified and has made clear in his report that he has found no evidence that anyone outside of the IRS had any involvement in the inappropriate targeting of conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status"" Carney said.Speaking to the same organization last year McConnell accused the administration and Obama's re-election campaign of leaking tax information and maintaining an enemies list in a chilling style reminiscent of President Richard Nixon the Republican who resigned in 1974 amid the Watergate scandal. McConnell's criticism was largely dismissed as election-year hyperbole.In the first six months of Obama's second term the administration's problems have produced an assortment of political targets for Republicans. One is the IRS affair which has resulted in resignations and departures from the agency. So far no evidence has come to light that anyone in the Obama administration outside the IRS was involved in targeting conservative groups for extra scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status.Story continuesOther issues facing the Obama administration this year include government surveillance of phone and Internet records; its handling of last year's terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi Libya which killed four Americans; the Justice Department's seizure of phone records of journalists at The Associated Press and in another case reading the emails of Fox News reporter James Rosen.McConnell referred to the IRS episode with a bit of I-told-you-so.""When I warned about all this last year I got slammed by the usual suspects on the left. They said I was full of it"" he said. ""But even some of them now seem to realize that just because McConnell is the one pulling the alarm doesn't mean there isn't a fire. The IRS scandal has reminded people of the temptations to abuse that big government and its political patrons are prone to. People are waking up to a pattern here.""In comments certain to appeal to Republican voters McConnell described public sector unions as power hungry and able to expand their reach with the help of congressional friends. He said the unions no longer serve the public's interest but rather serve the government's.""There's no better illustration of this than the announcement this week that in the midst of congressional hearings into their activities unionized employees at the IRS are about to get $70 million in bonuses"" McConnell complained.Sen. Chuck Grassley R-Iowa said earlier this week that the IRS plans to hand out $70 million in bonuses to employees. Under a contract with the employees' union IRS workers can receive individual performance bonuses of up to $3500 a year.In response to Grassley's criticism the agency said it's under a legal obligation to comply with its collective bargaining agreement with the National Treasury Employees Union. The agency and the union say they are in negotiations over the matter.____Associated Press writer Josh Lederman contributed to this report.____Follow Donna Cassata at https://twitter.com/DonnaCassataAP",1

551,Republicans and conservative Democrats just voted to sell you out to Wall Street. In other words it's Tuesday.Today the House passed the so-called Retail Investor Protection Act 254 to 166. 30 Democrats voted with 224 Republicans in favor. 165 Democrats--and one Republican--voted against it. Those following H.R. 2374 thought it would pass with wide bipartisan margins so having 165 Democratic NAY's was better than expected. The 30 Democratic YEA's still need to be named and shamed however.First let's begin with the important question: What is the Retail Investor Protection Act? The bill delays a new Department of Labor rule that would prevent financial advisers from stealing from your 401(K) plans or IRAs. Allowing financial advisers to rip you off is a great complement to that other plank in the Republican-Conservadem retirement insecurity platform cutting Social Security.Here's David Dayen with more details:The Labor Department proposal known as the “fiduciary rule” would change the ethical standards by which employer-based retirement products like 401(k)’s and IRAs are marketed and sold. The rule has not been updated since 1975 before 401(k)’s and IRAs even existed. The Labor Department wants to broaden the definition of a “fiduciary” to cover all financial advisers who offer individual investment advice for a fee. Under the rule they would be legally required to work in the best interest of their clients. For example a fiduciary would not be able to push investment products on customers in which they have a financial stake. The agency defines the goal of the proposal as “to ensure that potential conflicts of interest among advisers are not allowed to compromise the quality of investment advice that millions of American workers rely on so they can retire with the dignity that they have worked hard to achieve.” ... Currently it is depressingly common for financial advisers more than 80 percent of whom are not fiduciaries to self-deal when offering advice. First off they obtain large fees from the retirement products they sell. According to the think tank Demos a median-income two-earner household will pay $155000 during their lifetime to financial advisers on average. (The lifetime gains for two-earner households from retirement accounts are around $230000 meaning that nearly two-thirds of the profits go to the industry.) Second non-fiduciary financial advisers can enjoy kickbacks; right now there is no rule against an adviser from a mutual fund company encouraging clients to put their money in specific funds sold by that company. In fact that’s the norm and the adviser typically receives a commission for the sale. Conflicts of interest like this cost retirement investors at least $1 billion a month because the funds they get channeled into underperform the alternatives. Financial advisers also encourage rollovers into high-cost IRAs when an individual changes jobs. None of these schemes have to be disclosed to the customer under the current standard. The National Bureau for Economic Research found in a recent study that “adviser self‐interest plays an important role in generating advice that is not in the best interest of the clients.” So in the middle of a retirement crisis when the majority of Americans already aren’t accumulating the savings they need to maintain their standard of living sellers of retirement products are skimming close to $60 billion a year off the top through deceptive practices making a bad situation even worse.Now that we know what it is let's move to the next question: Who voted for it?The lone Republican NO was Walter Jones (NC-03).And here are the 30 Democratic YEA votes. Most of their names should look familiar if you've seen any of my past roll call diaries.John Barrow (GA-12)John Carney (DE-AL)Gerry Connolly (VA-11)Jim Costa (CA-16)Henry Cuellar (TX-28)John Delaney (MD-06)Ted Deutch (FL-21)Bill Foster (IL-11)Pete Gallego (TX-23)Joe Garcia (FL-26)Denny Heck (WA-10)Jim Himes (CT-04)Derek Kilmer (WA-06)Ron Kind (WI-03)Rick Larsen (WA-02)Dan Maffei (NY-24)Jim Matheson (UT-04)Mike McIntyre (NC-07)Gwen Moore (WI-04)Patrick Murphy (FL-18)Bill Owens (NY-21)Ed Perlmuter (CO-07)Scott Peters (CA-52)Gary Peters (MI-09)Collin Peterson (MN-07)Bradley Schneider (IL-10)Kurt Schrader (OR-05)Brad Sherman (CA-30)Kyrsten Sinema (AZ-09)Filemon Vela (TX-34)Note the appearance of Gary Peters on the list.

553,"Controversial Democrat Alan Grayson has set off a flurry of criticism from conservatives after the Florida congressman sent out a fundraising email to supporters in which he compared the tea party to the Ku Klux Klan.Grayson’s original comments came during a recent appearance on MSNBC’s “Politics Nation with Al Sharpton.” Grayson was discussing the tea party’s influence on the Republican Party when he said “At this point the tea party is no more popular than the Klan.”And rather than shy away from that comment Grayson included them in bold letters on his website with the quote taking readers directly to a fundraising page for Grayson’s re-election campaign.Grayson’s fundraising page includes the image of a burning cross; it uses the cross as the letter “T” and spells out “tea party” in flaming letters:""As a black Tea Party activist I could say that there's nothing more offensive than equating the Tea Party with the Ku Klux Klan” Jennifer Burke National Outreach Director for TheTeaParty.net said in a statement emailed to Yahoo News. “The hate speech uttered by sitting congressman Alan Grayson is deplorable even by the low levels reached in recent years when Democrats routinely call us racists and suicide bombers.""Grayson’s comments were also criticized by the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).There’s no excuse for the hateful words and imagery used by Congressman Grayson” NRCC spokesman Matt Gorman said in a statement. “House Democrats should swiftly and strongly condemn him and return the money he has raised for them. This hate-filled rhetoric has Americans fed up with Washington.”Grayson is no stranger to controversy. First elected to Congress in 2008 he regularly was an outspoken critic of Republicans and conservatives in general. He was voted out of office after his first term and many observers expected him to take a role as an activist outside of government. However Grayson was re-elected in 2012 and is considered a strong favorite for re-election in 2014.Despite the criticism over his KKK comparison Grayson has stood by his comments and subsequent fundraising effort. He pointed to offensive comments and signage that appeared at past tea party rallies to justify his own comments.“Tea Party members have circulated countless altered pictures depicting President Obama and the First Lady as monkeys. Tea Party members also called my fellow Member of Congress civil rights hero John Lewis a ‘n***ger’ and Rep. Barney Frank a ‘faggot’” Grayson said in a statement. “One could go on and on because there is overwhelming evidence that the Tea Party is the home of bigotry and discrimination in America today just as the KKK was for an earlier generation. If the shoe fits wear it.”",0

555,"This article is the third in a six-part series about the drug war and police reform. Read Part 2 here.SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah is one of the reddest and most culturally conservative states in America. The statehouse would seem to be about as fertile ground for reining in the drug war and curbing police abuse as the briny marshes and salt flats just outside the capital. But if anyone can bring Utah's conservatives on board with police reform it's probably Connor Boyack a clean-cut Mormon with a Republican background who is also pushing the state to nullify the Affordable Care Act.Boyack 31 is the founder and president of the Libertas Institute a state think tank with a libertarian bent. ""Utah politics is basically a debate between conservatives and libertarian-minded conservatives"" he says. ""We help conservatives hone their free-market ideas but we also want to persuade them to be more deferential to civil liberties. That I think is our niche.""Boyack wrote about public policy for several years on his personal blog built up a readership and in August 2010 was hired to lead the Utah chapter of the Tenth Amendment Center an advocacy group that pushes returning federal power to the states. The boyish-looking student of political philosophy also worked on the 2010 campaign of Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee. His credentials on the right are sound.But he felt that more could be done on the state level and in December 2011 he founded Libertas.""One thing I noticed at the Tenth Amendment Center is that while liberty-minded Utah legislators could join arms to push back the federal government they weren't nearly as skeptical of the government here in Utah"" Boyack says. ""But if the government violates your rights you haven't been any less violated if it came from state or local government instead of the federal government. The thing we try to stress at Libertas is consistency.""He ran the organization part-time for about a year but by January he had attracted enough funding that he was able to commit to it fully.""What makes Connor unique -- and most effective -- is that he's willing to take on issues that the mainstream political right is generally afraid to touch"" says Michael Boldin executive director of the Tenth Amendment Center. ""They might even agree with him on the issues but don't want to upset the status quo so they do and say nothing. Connor on the other hand recognizes that it takes risk to get things done. And he certainly takes risks.""Boyack gradually became interested in police reform as he was exposed to police abuse stories on social media. ""You can't really be active on Twitter or Facebook without seeing these stories really on a daily basis"" he says. ""And it isn't just the misconduct it's that bad police officers are so rarely held accountable.""After law enforcement officials raided the Ogden Utah home of Matthew David Stewart in response to a tip that he was growing marijuana plants in his basement leading to a gun battle that left one officer dead and five others wounded Boyack watched closely to see whether that type of scenario would play out.""That case really catalyzed my focus. I watched at first from the sidelines -- followed the story closely. I'm not an activist or a protester. I tend to come at things from an education or legislative angle"" he says.""As it unfolded the way that it did I was really disappointed. Once again the police weren't being held accountable. The media narrative was that Matthew was this evil cop-killer. My concern was with the underlying policy from a legislative standpoint. The police should not have come in to Stewart's house the way they did all over a few plants. The law just shouldn't allow that to happen.""As Stewart's supporters -- led by members of his family as well as progressive activist Jesse Fruhwirth -- protested at Ogden city council meetings Boyack took a broader view.""I think what the protesters were doing was important"" he says. ""But my thinking was that this wasn't just happening in Ogden. Police militarization is happening everywhere. So we were more interested in looking at the state as a whole.""Boyack began reaching out to legislators police organizations and activists to craft a bill that would restrict the use of SWAT teams to emergency scenarios ones in which lives are at risk.The policy he's pushing is relatively straightforward. Currently police in Utah may forcibly enter any home at any time so long as they've obtained a search warrant. Under Boyack's proposal officers would be permitted to break into a home only when there is an imminent threat of a violent crime.The police would no longer be permitted to use battering rams or ""dynamic entry"" -- the term used to describe forcible entry the use of flash grenades and other paramilitary tactics -- to serve drug warrants. In Utah and across the country drug investigations comprise the overwhelming majority of instances in which such tactics are used.Last August the Standard-Examiner ran an editorial in support of Boyack's cause. ""Certainly the use of a battering rams to combat minor offenses is something that should not occur"" the paper wrote. ""These raids as conducted now are too dangerous.""""We're interested in saving lives"" Boyack says. ""And we're as interested in saving the lives behind the gun as those in front of it.""Boyack uses that line often. It hints at the realpolitik that may help explain why his message is finding a receptive audience. A cop died during the Stewart raid and several more nearly joined him. Particularly in conservative Utah saving the lives of police officers is a more effective sales pitch than saving the lives of suspected drug offenders.""I don't think there's any question about it. If this law had been in place in 2011 both Officer [Jared] Francom and Matthew Stewart would still be alive"" Boyack says. Stewart committed suicide in his jail cell while awaiting trial.Boyack says many of the lawmakers he's talked to about his bill have been supportive. Indeed several told The Huffington Post that they see the need for police reform though they would not say so for attribution.""The response has been surprisingly favorable"" Boyack says. ""I think most lawmakers want to wait to see the final language though. The bill should be collaborative rather than combative. Few legislators will support a bill that's seen as anti-cop but they're generally supportive of the higher idea.""Ideally Boyack would like to get a conservative lawmaker who otherwise supports the drug war to sponsor the bill.""I think drugs should be decriminalized but this bill isn't about legalization"" he says. ""We can still keep drugs illegal but enforce those laws in a way that doesn't put lives at risk. So I think it would be helpful to get a sponsor for the bill who has drug war bona fides but understands that sending police officers to break into homes in the middle of the night creates unnecessary danger.""But he worries that many politicians may be reluctant to publicly embrace the bill even if they think it's the right thing to do because they fear retribution.""A few years ago we tried to outlaw DUI checkpoints which I think are a violation of the Fourth Amendment and really are more about issuing citations and raising revenue for police departments than keeping the roads safe"" he says. ""Law enforcement groups came out aggressively against the bill. But they also went after the bill's sponsor [state Rep.] David Butterfield when he ran for reelection.""That bill passed the Utah House but died in the Senate in February 2012. State police groups organized to support Butterfield's primary opponent in the 2012 election and Butterfield lost.""They got their scalp"" Boyack says. ""I understand the concern about micromanaging police departments. I do. But everything police officers do is under authority given them by the legislature through the people. It's the legislature's job to set the terms under which the laws will be enforced and its the legislature's job to make sure our rights are protected not just our safety.""Boyack is the bridge-builder in Utah's burgeoning police reform movement. His task is to forge ties between the state's legislators and other policymakers and activists and the families of those killed by police.""By sticking his neck out and taking on a golden calf he's able to bridge the divide with traditional political opponents"" says The Tenth Amendment Center's Boldin.He's also the pragmatist. For the moment the bill he and his organization have proposed addresses only forced-entry police raids. It would have had no effect on the police shootings beatings and other allegations of misconduct around Utah that weren't the result of drug raids.Some activists want to go further. They would like to see police get more training in interacting with the mentally ill and they have called for the creation of civilian review boards with the teeth to issue subpoenas and force the termination of bad cops. Some including Salt Lake City Police Chief Chris Burbank think police need more instruction in conflict resolution and that training and agency policy put too little emphasis on de-escalation and too much on how and when to use force.But Boyack says that for now focusing on forced-entry is a more realistic goal.""Our main goal here is to enact substantive reform. We don't just want a token bill that does more in name than in substance"" Boyack says. ""But we also need a bill that will pass and that will be reasonable. So for now I think it makes sense to focus on the one area that will do the most good and that in my opinion will save the most lives.""Continue to Part 4: An Occupy Activist's New Cause: Drug Raids And Police AbuseHuffPost writer and investigative reporter Radley Balko is also the author of the new book Rise of the Warrior Cop: The Militarization of America's Police Forces.",1
556,"The right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no Warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by Oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized. Fourth Amendment to the United States ConstitutionWhat this means is the government has to have "" information sufficient to warrant a prudent person's belief that the wanted individual had committed a crime (for an arrest warrant) or that evidence of a crime or contraband would be found in a search (for a search warrant) "". A person walking down the street can't be stopped or their house can't be searched unless the police have a concrete reason to stop the person or search the house. The police have to go before a judge and explain their probable cause and if the judge agrees then a warrant is issued for a search or an arrest.Testing welfare recipients violates that principle because the government is searching a person without knowledge that the person is in fact taking drugs. The common saying is that it would be a ""fishing expedition"". Courts tend to frown on fishing expeditions.Even police at traffic stops for drug interdiction have to ask the driver for permission to search their vehicle and only if they refuse do they bring a dog in to sniff the outside of the car. If the dog gets a hit then the police have probable cause to search the car.As the ACLU states concerning drug testing for welfare recipients:The ACLU challenged the mandatory drug testing program as unconstitutional arguing that drug testing of welfare recipients violates the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches. The case Marchwinski v. Howard concluded when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit upheld a lower court's decision striking down the policy as unconstitutional. In halting the implementation of Michigan's drug testing law U.S. District Court Judge Victoria Roberts ruled that the state's rationale for testing welfare recipients ""could be used for testing the parents of all children who received Medicaid State Emergency Relief educational grants or loans public education or any other benefit from that State.""[18] Indeed any of the justifications put forth to subject welfare recipients to random drug testing would also by logical extension apply to the entirety of our population that receives some public benefit and/or that is a parent. It is clear that our constitution – and common sense – would object to the random drug testing of this large group of people making the drug testing of an equally absurd category of people – welfare recipients – unconstitutional as well. Drug Testing of Public Assistance Recipients as a Condition of EligibilityBut Doug you are saying I got tested before I got hired at my job? Fair is fair right?The ACLU also is opposed to pre-employment drug testing but sometimes people forget our Bill of Rights don't always apply to private businesses.The court has read the Fourth Amendment to prohibit only those government searches or seizures that are ""unreasonable."" Because of this businesses that are in an industry that is ""closely regulated"" can be searched more frequently and can be searched without a warrant. In one case an auto parts dealer at a junkyard was charged with receiving stolen auto parts. Part of his defense was to claim that the search that found incriminating evidence was unconstitutional. But the court found the search reasonable because the dealer was in a ""closely regulated industry."" Note again that constitutional guarantees like the Fourth Amendment apply to governmental action. Your employer or any private enterprise is not bound by constitutional limits. For example if drug testing of all employees every week is done by government agency the employees may have a cause of action to object based on the Fourth Amendment. However if a private employer begins the same kind of routine drug testing employees have no constitutional arguments to make; they can simply leave that employer or they may pursue whatever statutory or common-law remedies are available. Introduction to the Law of Property Estate Planning and Insurance (4.5 Business and the Bill of Rights)It is kind of ironic that some of the same friends supporting random drug testing of poor people are the same ones who objected when the story about employers asking for Facebook passwords came out . They claimed the same arguments I'm using here against drug testing to oppose giving up their passwords. I don't see the difference between drug testing and giving up passwords although the 4th amendment is stronger for drug testing than giving up passwords.I haven't even addressed the fact that drug testing of poor people is both a waste of tax dollars and only catches a insignificant number of drug users.The state of Florida passed an almost identical testing procedure that ran from 1999 to 2001 and was reintroduced in July of 2011 that was struck down by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta the following month citing the fact: ""there is nothing inherent to the condition of being impoverished that supports the conclusion that there is a `concrete danger' that impoverished individuals are prone to drug use."" The Tampa Tribune investigated the results of those July 2011 drug tests and found that ""96 percent proved to be drug free"" another 2 percent never bothering to complete the lengthy application process and 2 percent actually failing drug testing. At an average cost of $30 per test the state was hemorrhaging tax dollars at a rate of ""$28800-$43200 monthly""... FAR out pacing the supposed ""savings"" from preventing drug-abusers from gaming the system to buy drugs. Texas Senate Unanimously Votes to Drug Test Welfare ApplicantsDrug testing is expensive. The average cost of a drug test is about $42 per person tested[8] not including the costs of hiring personnel to administer the tests to ensure confidentiality of results and to run confirmatory tests to guard against false positives resulting from passive drug exposure cross-identification with legal prescription drugs such as codeine and legal substances such as poppy seeds.Another way to measure the cost is by counting what it costs to ""catch"" each drug user. Drug testing is not used by many private employers because of the exorbitant cost of catching each person who tests positive. One electronics manufacturer for example estimated that the cost of finding each person who tested positive was $20000 since after testing 10000 employees only 49 tested positive. A congressional committee also estimated that the cost of each positive drug test of government employees was $77000 because the positive rate was only 0.5%.[9] Mandatory drug testing is an ineffective means to uncover drug abuse. An Oklahoma study found that a questionnaire was able to accurately detect 94 out of 100 drug abusers. The questionnaire was also useful in detecting alcohol abusers something drug tests fail to accomplish.[10]Certain counties in Oregon experimented with drug testing on some welfare recipients but the process was halted when it was found that drug testing was less effective in identifying drug abuse than less invasive cheaper methods.[11]Most types of drug tests fail to detect alcohol abuse – the most commonly abused substance among Americans – and are most likely to detect marijuana use since the active ingredient in marijuana stays in the body's system longer than any other illicit substance. Therefore drug tests often fail to identify people who are using more powerful more addictive and more dangerous drugs like methamphetamine or cocaine which exit the body's system in a matter of hours or days.[12] Many states have rejected the random drug testing of welfare recipients as impractical and fiscally unjustifiable. For example New York and Maryland each considered a program to randomly drug test those receiving welfare but abandoned the plan as not cost-effective given that urinalysis is almost exclusively a barometer of marijuana use and that welfare recipients are required to undergo regular supervision allowing for effective monitoring absent the cost and intrusion of mandatory drug testing.[13]Louisiana passed a law in 1997 requiring drug testing for welfare recipients. However a task force set up to implement the law found more limited drug testing of individuals identified by a questionnaire to be more cost-effective than mandatory drug testing.[14]Alabama decided against drug testing because it found that focusing on job training programs was a more effective method of moving individuals off of welfare.[15] Drug Testing of Public Assistance Recipients as a Condition of EligibilitySen. Tim Schaffer plans to introduce legislation today that would establish a drug-testing pilot program for Ohio Works First applicants. ""It is time that we recognize that many families are trying to survive in drug-induced poverty and we have an obligation to make sure taxpayer money is not being used to support drug dealers"" Schaffer said. ""We can no longer turn a blind eye to this problem."" The proposal comes as Ohio's public welfare rolls are at their lowest levels in decades. As of June slightly fewer than 25000 adults received cash assistance. Children who make up the bulk of recipients about 107000 would be exempt from drug testing under Schaffer's proposal. Schaffer R-Lancaster said he hopes to avoid similar lawsuits by requiring applicants to be tested only if they indicate on a questionnaire that they have used drugs in the past six months. Michigan's drug-testing law he said was found unconstitutional because it required all applicants to undergo screenings regardless of whether there was reason to believe they were using illegal drugs. Drug tests for welfare pushedOhio State Senator Tim Schaffer (R) has decided again that Ohio needs drug testing. He still doesn't know how public assistance works but he is reaching to show his bigoted constituents he can punch a poor person like a good Republican:There must be an election coming up. That's when we get these silly ""bash the poor"" laws. The simple fact is most people who have little to no money don't buy drugs and the idea that all welfare recipients use drugs is not supported by the evidence. It is a bigoted idea and drug testing is unconstitutional.Thanks for putting this post on the rec list. I appreciate it and the good comments I've been reading. -- dlbOriginally published on Doug's Views",0
557,Commuters at the Judiciary Square Metro station walk past a new ad billboard calling for jurors to rule for jury nullification on Oct. 24 in Washington. (Marlon Correa/The Washington Post)The illuminated billboard in the Judiciary Square Metro station near the F Street entrance was strategically placed.Prospective jurors who take the subway to D.C. Superior Court and exit near the National Building Museum see these words: “Good jurors nullify bad laws” and “You have the right to ‘hang’ the jury with your vote if you cannot agree with other jurors.”Since the billboard went up this month District prosecutors have been worried that the message could sway their cases. In the past week alone they have asked judges in three ­cases to ensure that jurors had neither seen nor been influenced by the billboard.The billboard is part of a growing national campaign to encourage jurors who disagree with a law or think a punishment is too harsh to vote for acquittal. Kirsten Tynan of the Montana-based Fully Informed Jury Association whose name and Web address is included on the billboard said the nonprofit group generally challenges crimes it calls “victimless” such as vandalism by graffiti or gun possession.James Babb a Philadelphia-based graphics artist who organized a fundraising campaign to put up the billboard said he raised $3000 in about a week through Facebook and other ­social-media sites. He said he is concerned about laws that he thinks are too restrictive.“People are going to jail for weed” Babb said. “Things are getting so weird. There needs to be this final safeguard to protect us from a tyrannical government.”Babb’s group has added a similar message on two pillars in Archives station another Metro stop near the courthouse. Both displays are scheduled to be up for about a month. Babb said he also plans to place signs in other cities including Chicago and Los Angeles.Supporters of jury nullification in several cities have raised the ire of judges and prosecutors. In New York last year an 80-year-old man was charged with jury tampering after passing out fliers about jury nullification to courthouse visitors; the case was later dismissed by a federal judge.Locally prosecutors have been scrambling to ensure that the billboard’s message doesn’t influence their ­cases.In a gang-related murder trial set to begin this week prosecutors filed a motion asking the judge to question potential jurors about whether they had seen the billboard. They also requested that the judge remind jurors that their verdict should not be influenced by whether they agree or disagree with the law.In their memo prosecutors Todd Gee and Emily Miller wrote that jurors who see the billboard may think “they don’t have to abide by an oath” and that it could encourage them “to hang and to learn about the concept of jury nullification.”In another recent murder case the jury had already been sworn in and the trial was underway when prosecutors alerted Superior Court Judge Herbert Dixon to the billboard. Dixon according to people familiar with the case then asked the jurors if they had seen the billboard. No one said they had.Days later the jury found the defendant Grant Johnson 39 of Bladensburg Md. guilty of first-degree murder in the slaying of 32-year-old Ricardo Lancaster during a drug deal in 2012 prosecutors said.And in a trial involving an assault with a deadly weapon Assistant U.S. Attorney Brittain Shaw asked the judge to question potential jurors about the billboard. Days later the jury found the defendant Charles Link 53 guilty in a knife attack in November that left one man injured.The billboard also comes as Adam Kokesh a Fairfax County-based gun rights activist is preparing to go to trial after posting an Independence Day video on YouTube of himself apparently loading a shotgun in Freedom Plaza. He had been scheduled to go to trial Thursday but the case was pushed back to at least Nov. 18.Kokesh’s supporters have advocated for jury nullification in his case.Tynan said the Metro billboard was not directly aimed at the Kokesh who pleaded not guilty to carrying a pistol without a license but she said that his case was the kind her organization targeted. “It’s a victimless trial” Tynan said.A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office said there has been no organized effort by prosecutors to address the billboard but instead prosecutors have raised the issue on a case-by-case basis.“Jurors in the District of Columbia play an important role in holding accountable the criminals who threaten and harm the people who live work and visit our city” U.S. Attorney Ronald C. Machen Jr. said in a statement. But he added “Jurors who ignore the law or refuse to follow the judge’s instructions embolden criminals who believe that they can get away with breaking the law and do harm to the community without any repercussion.”,0
558,"By John Shiffman and Kristina CookeWASHINGTON Aug 5 (Reuters) - A secretive U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration unit is funneling information from intelligence intercepts wiretaps informants and a massive database of telephone records to authorities across the nation to help them launch criminal investigations of Americans.Although these cases rarely involve national security issues documents reviewed by Reuters show that law enforcement agents have been directed to conceal how such investigations truly begin - not only from defense lawyers but also sometimes from prosecutors and judges.The undated documents show that federal agents are trained to ""recreate"" the investigative trail to effectively cover up where the information originated a practice that some experts say violates a defendant's Constitutional right to a fair trial. If defendants don't know how an investigation began they cannot know to ask to review potential sources of exculpatory evidence - information that could reveal entrapment mistakes or biased witnesses.""I have never heard of anything like this at all"" said Nancy Gertner a Harvard Law School professor who served as a federal judge from 1994 to 2011. Gertner and other legal experts said the program sounds more troubling than recent disclosures that the National Security Agency has been collecting domestic phone records. The NSA effort is geared toward stopping terrorists; the DEA program targets common criminals primarily drug dealers.""It is one thing to create special rules for national security"" Gertner said. ""Ordinary crime is entirely different. It sounds like they are phonying up investigations.""THE SPECIAL OPERATIONS DIVISIONThe unit of the DEA that distributes the information is called the Special Operations Division or SOD. Two dozen partner agencies comprise the unit including the FBI CIA NSA Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Homeland Security. It was created in 1994 to combat Latin American drug cartels and has grown from several dozen employees to several hundred.Today much of the SOD's work is classified and officials asked that its precise location in Virginia not be revealed. The documents reviewed by Reuters are marked ""Law Enforcement Sensitive"" a government categorization that is meant to keep them confidential.""Remember that the utilization of SOD cannot be revealed or discussed in any investigative function"" a document presented to agents reads. The document specifically directs agents to omit the SOD's involvement from investigative reports affidavits discussions with prosecutors and courtroom testimony. Agents are instructed to then use ""normal investigative techniques to recreate the information provided by SOD.""A spokesman with the Department of Justice which oversees the DEA declined to comment.But two senior DEA officials defended the program and said trying to ""recreate"" an investigative trail is not only legal but a technique that is used almost daily.A former federal agent in the northeastern United States who received such tips from SOD described the process. ""You'd be told only 'Be at a certain truck stop at a certain time and look for a certain vehicle.' And so we'd alert the state police to find an excuse to stop that vehicle and then have a drug dog search it"" the agent said.""PARALLEL CONSTRUCTION""After an arrest was made agents then pretended that their investigation began with the traffic stop not with the SOD tip the former agent said. The training document reviewed by Reuters refers to this process as ""parallel construction.""The two senior DEA officials who spoke on behalf of the agency but only on condition of anonymity said the process is kept secret to protect sources and investigative methods. ""Parallel construction is a law enforcement technique we use every day"" one official said. ""It's decades old a bedrock concept.""A dozen current or former federal agents interviewed by Reuters confirmed they had used parallel construction during their careers. Most defended the practice; some said they understood why those outside law enforcement might be concerned.""It's just like laundering money - you work it backwards to make it clean"" said Finn Selander a DEA agent from 1991 to 2008 and now a member of a group called Law Enforcement Against Prohibition which advocates legalizing and regulating narcotics.Some defense lawyers and former prosecutors said that using ""parallel construction"" may be legal to establish probable cause for an arrest. But they said employing the practice as a means of disguising how an investigation began may violate pretrial discovery rules by burying evidence that could prove useful to criminal defendants.A QUESTION OF CONSTITUTIONALITY""That's outrageous"" said Tampa attorney James Felman a vice chairman of the criminal justice section of the American Bar Association. ""It strikes me as indefensible.""Lawrence Lustberg a New Jersey defense lawyer said any systematic government effort to conceal the circumstances under which cases begin ""would not only be alarming but pretty blatantly unconstitutional.""Lustberg and others said the government's use of the SOD program skirts established court procedures by which judges privately examine sensitive information such as an informant's identity or classified evidence to determine whether the information is relevant to the defense.""You can't game the system"" said former federal prosecutor Henry E. Hockeimer Jr. ""You can't create this subterfuge. These are drug crimes not national security cases. If you don't draw the line here where do you draw it?""Some lawyers say there can be legitimate reasons for not revealing sources. Robert Spelke a former prosecutor who spent seven years as a senior DEA lawyer said some sources are classified. But he also said there are few reasons why unclassified evidence should be concealed at trial.""It's a balancing act and they've doing it this way for years"" Spelke said. ""Do I think it's a good way to do it? No because now that I'm a defense lawyer I see how difficult it is to challenge.""CONCEALING A TIPOne current federal prosecutor learned how agents were using SOD tips after a drug agent misled him the prosecutor told Reuters. In a Florida drug case he was handling the prosecutor said a DEA agent told him the investigation of a U.S. citizen began with a tip from an informant. When the prosecutor pressed for more information he said a DEA supervisor intervened and revealed that the tip had actually come through the SOD and from an NSA intercept.""I was pissed"" the prosecutor said. ""Lying about where the information came from is a bad start if you're trying to comply with the law because it can lead to all kinds of problems with discovery and candor to the court."" The prosecutor never filed charges in the case because he lost confidence in the investigation he said.A senior DEA official said he was not aware of the case but said the agent should not have misled the prosecutor. How often such misdirection occurs is unknown even to the government; the DEA official said the agency does not track what happens with tips after the SOD sends them to agents in the field.The SOD's role providing information to agents isn't itself a secret. It is briefly mentioned by the DEA in budget documents albeit without any reference to how that information is used or represented when cases go to court.The DEA has long publicly touted the SOD's role in multi-jurisdictional and international investigations connecting agents in separate cities who may be unwittingly investigating the same target and making sure undercover agents don't accidentally try to arrest each other.SOD'S BIG SUCCESSESThe unit also played a major role in a 2008 DEA sting in Thailand against Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout; he was sentenced in 2011 to 25 years in prison on charges of conspiring to sell weapons to the Colombian rebel group FARC. The SOD also recently coordinated Project Synergy a crackdown against manufacturers wholesalers and retailers of synthetic designer drugs that spanned 35 states and resulted in 227 arrests.Since its inception the SOD's mandate has expanded to include narco-terrorism organized crime and gangs. A DEA spokesman declined to comment on the unit's annual budget. A recent LinkedIn posting on the personal page of a senior SOD official estimated it to be $125 million.Today the SOD offers at least three services to federal state and local law enforcement agents: coordinating international investigations such as the Bout case; distributing tips from overseas NSA intercepts informants foreign law enforcement partners and domestic wiretaps; and circulating tips from a massive database known as DICE.The DICE database contains about 1 billion records the senior DEA officials said. The majority of the records consist of phone log and Internet data gathered legally by the DEA through subpoenas arrests and search warrants nationwide. Records are kept for about a year and then purged the DEA officials said.About 10000 federal state and local law enforcement agents have access to the DICE database records show. They can query it to try to link otherwise disparate clues. Recently one of the DEA officials said DICE linked a man who tried to smuggle $100000 over the U.S. southwest border to a major drug case on the East Coast.""We use it to connect the dots"" the official said.""AN AMAZING TOOL""Wiretap tips forwarded by the SOD usually come from foreign governments U.S. intelligence agencies or court-authorized domestic phone recordings. Because warrantless eavesdropping on Americans is illegal tips from intelligence agencies are generally not forwarded to the SOD until a caller's citizenship can be verified according to one senior law enforcement official and one former U.S. military intelligence analyst.""They do a pretty good job of screening but it can be a struggle to know for sure whether the person on a wiretap is American"" the senior law enforcement official said.Tips from domestic wiretaps typically occur when agents use information gleaned from a court-ordered wiretap in one case to start a second investigation.As a practical matter law enforcement agents said they usually don't worry that SOD's involvement will be exposed in court. That's because most drug-trafficking defendants plead guilty before trial and therefore never request to see the evidence against them. If cases did go to trial current and former agents said charges were sometimes dropped to avoid the risk of exposing SOD involvement.Current and former federal agents said SOD tips aren't always helpful - one estimated their accuracy at 60 percent. But current and former agents said tips have enabled them to catch drug smugglers who might have gotten away.""It was an amazing tool"" said one recently retired federal agent. ""Our big fear was that it wouldn't stay secret.""DEA officials said that the SOD process has been reviewed internally. They declined to provide Reuters with a copy of their most recent review.

559,The Ohio State Senate held a second hearing Thursday night on a proposal to establish pilot drug-testing programs in three counties. Under the proposal applicants would be required to submit a drug test if they disclose that they have used illegal substances. The proposal was first introduced in the spring but pressure from opponents led Gov. John Kasich to squash the bill in May. Virginia Republicans are also reviving a bill that was shelved earlier this year. The 2012 version failed after the state estimated it would cost $1.5 million to implement while only saving $229000. The bill’s sponsor Delegate Dickie Bell has not introduced the updated version yet but says he’s found more cost effective options.Looking at the range of drug testing-for-benefits bills being pushed in state legislatures across the country you almost have to suspect Republicans of some kind of urine fetish. In addition to all the states that are debating or have passed bills requiring people applying for unemployment insurance benefits to pee in cups drug-testing bills aimed at welfare applicants are being introduced in three states. The specifics would be ripe for comedy if we weren't talking about a concerted effort by the powerful to stigmatize vulnerable people as drug addicts as if that's the only reason a person might need help in an economy in which there are still more than three job-seekers for every job opening:Those would have to be some pretty damn significant changes to the cost structure to erase a nearly $1.25 million deficit. Virginia wasn't the first to run into that kind of problem; a Florida law mandating drug-testing of welfare applicants cost the state money because so few people's tests were positive leaving the cost of the tests higher than the savings from denying people benefits. And that's leaving aside the cost of the lawsuits for a law that was ultimately found unconstitutional.Both Ohio and Kansas legislators are trying to pretend the goal is to help people rather than to associate welfare recipients with drug abuse in the public debate claiming that they just want to be sure people get the help they need. Bear in mind that in Florida just 2.6 percent of applicants didn't pass their drug tests. So when you have Republican legislators who don't show any signs of wanting to help any kind of working-class or middle-class people even suddenly dripping with concern for welfare applicants ... well you just have to call bullshit.,0
560,On Sept. 12 religious-liberty leaders met with Pentagon officials to discuss the rapidly-escalating incidents of religious-liberty violations in the military under the Obama administration.On Apr. 28 Breitbart News broke the story of Pentagon brass meeting with anti-Christian activist Mikey Weinstein to discuss religious-liberty policies. Quoting Weinstein in his own printed words this activist has a record of calling observant Christians “fundamentalist monsters” who seek impose “theocratic terror” on America and that evangelizing (sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ) in the military is an act of “sedition and treason” against this country making those who do it “enemies of the Constitution.” He says those who do so should be court-martialed (criminally prosecuted).As this story developed the Obama-Hagel Pentagon defended its policy and changed its story several times as it was revealed that these meetings with Weinstein had been going on for years. In the following months there were additional incidents such as removing Christian patriotic artwork at a military base censoring a Christian chaplain and a Christian service member reportedly being relieved of duty by his lesbian commander because he refused her order to say that it is wrong not to support gay marriage.Now leaders from Restore Military Religious Freedom–a coalition to protect service members of faith–met with Pentagon officials. Lt. Gen. Jerry Boykin (ret.) of the Family Research Council Col. Ron Crews (ret.) of the Chaplains Alliance for Religious Liberty Kellie Fiedorek of the Alliance Defending Freedom and nationally-known Christian talk radio host Sandy Rios took with them two petitions calling on Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to protect religious liberty. One was a general petition with 170000 signatures and the other–with 50000 signatures–was sparked by the last incident mentioned above where Air Force Senior Master Sergeant Phillip Monk was relieved of duty by Maj. Elisa Valenzuela allegedly because of Monk’s Christian beliefs on marriage. Monk now faces possible court martial.These Christian leaders met with Lt. Gen. Richard C. Harding the three-star judge advocate general of the Air Force (the top lawyer in that branch of the military) and Maj. Gen. Howard D. Stendahl the two-star Air Force chief of chaplains.Gen. Boykin said after the meeting:The meeting included a productive discussion on the issue of religious freedom in the military as a whole and not just the U.S. Air Force. After delivering the petitions we explained our concerns regarding the trend towards infringements on the constitutional liberties of service members in all uniformed services. We appreciate their offer to review decisions that do not reflect Air Force policy made by commanders at various bases. At their request we will report future events and concerns directly to Air Force leadership. After reviewing a series of troubling incidents involving chaplains the coalition members were assured in the meeting that chaplains would not be forced to do anything that violates the tenets of their faith. We also requested that the Department of Defense and the Air Force issue a definitive statement regarding the ability of service members to share their faith publicly. Previous statements on the subject have been confusing and contradictory. Additionally we asked that the Department of Defense move quickly to implement the religious freedom protections enacted in last year’s National Defense Authorization Act. Given new incidents of military personnel facing career reprisals for their religious beliefs it is vital that regulations preventing discrimination be issued by the Secretary of Defense as demanded by law. We intend to remain in contact with the Air Force to ensure that the law’s implementation is consistent with the intent of Congress.Congress is working on new statutory language to protect such religious speech in the military which has passed the House and is pending in the Senate. President Obama threatens to veto this legislation.Breitbart News legal columnist Ken Klukowski is on faculty at Liberty University School of Law. Follow him on Twitter @kenklukowski.,0
561,The United States is expanding its military presence in Honduras on a spectacular scale. The Associated Press reported this month in an investigative article that Washington in 2011 authorized $1.3 billion for U.S. military electronics in Honduras. This is happening while the post-coup regime of Honduran President Porfirio Lobo is more out of control than ever especially since the Honduran Congress staged a “technical coup” in December.But as the Obama administration deepens its partnership with Honduras ostensibly to fight the drug war Democrats in Congress are increasingly rebelling. Here’s a message then for new Secretary of State John Kerry: Recast U.S. policy in Honduras and the murderous drug war that justifies it.AdvertisementIn the last few years the U.S. has been ramping up its military operations throughout Latin America in what the Associated Press called “the most expensive initiative in Latin America since the Cold War.” The buildup has cost U.S. taxpayers more than $20 billion since 2002 for troops ships clandestine bases radar military and police training and other expenses.U.S. military expenditures for Honduras in particular have gone up every year since 2009 when a military coup deposed democratically elected President Manuel Zelaya. At $67.4 million 2012 Defense Department contracts for Honduras are triple those of 10 years ago. The U.S. spent $25 million last year to make the U.S. barracks at the Soto Cano air base permanent and $89 million to keep 600 U.S. troops based there. U.S. direct aid to the Honduran military and police continues to climb as well.AdvertisementBut the Obama administration’s escalating military commitment in Honduras only deepens its support for the corrupt and repressive Lobo government. State security forces still enjoy near-complete impunity for thousands of alleged human rights abuses and even murders since the 2009 coup. The government hasn’t paid many of its teachers for at least six months and the country is close to bankrupt.On Dec. 13 in a clash of two equally corrupt groups of competing elites the Honduran Congress illegally deposed four members of the Supreme Court swearing in new justices within hours. Since then the congress has run roughshod over the constitution rapidly repassing a series of laws that had been overruled by the court including a much-criticized mining law and a notorious law authorizing so-called model cities in which the constitution itself doesn’t apply.AdvertisementThese actions blatantly disregard the rule of law. Yet the U.S. State Department looked the other way at this “technical coup.”In pouring U.S. military resources into the corrupt Honduran government Washington argues that it is helping fight drug trafficking which is indeed rampant murderous and growing. But the Honduran government and the elites who control it are widely alleged to be implicated in the drug trafficking.AdvertisementThe drug war though does provide cover for a new wave of U.S. aggression in Latin America. Honduras with the only large U.S. Air Force base between the United States and South America has long been important as a linchpin of U.S. military domination of the region including most famously U.S. involvement in the 1954 coup in Guatemala and the 1980s Contra war against the Nicaraguan government. Today the expanding U.S. role poses an enormous threat to the whole region and to Honduras’ sovereignty.Moreover as the media have reported the Obama administration’s drug war in Honduras has been a disaster. In May 2012 agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration participated in an operation in which four Afro-indigenous villagers were killed and several others injured in the Mosquitia region of Honduras. The DEA acknowledges that it killed two alleged drug traffickers in separate incidents in June and July. In July after the Honduran military shot down two supposed drug planes in violation of international protocol the U.S. suspended radar cooperation for drug flights. In January in the first joint operation after cooperation resumed the Honduran coast guard killed an alleged drug trafficker utilizing intelligence provided by DEA agents.AdvertisementMany Democrats in Congress have had enough. On Jan. 30 58 members of the House led by Reps. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) Karen Bass (D-Los Angeles) John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) and Gregory W. Meeks (D-N.Y.) sent a letter to Kerry and Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. demanding that the May 2012 incident involving the DEA be investigated calling attention to state-sponsored repression of Afro-indigenous Hondurans and questioning the drug war. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt. ) has on hold about $30 million in U.S. aid to Honduran security forces pending answers to questions about abuses of civilians and corruption.That’s a start but Kerry and the administration need to reverse U.S. policy in Honduras altogether. End the bloody drug war and focus on job creation and social justice instead. Stop treating the current Honduran government like a friendly partner; instead forthrightly denounce its human rights abuses and corruption of the rule of law. Help guarantee a free presidential election in November by condemning the assassinations of at least five opposition party activists and candidates in the last year and demand adequate protection for the hundreds of Hondurans in the opposition who have received death threats.AdvertisementIn other words stop arming Honduran thugs and allow those in the opposition the space to define their own future free of U.S. interference.Dana Frank is a professor of history at UC Santa Cruz whose work focuses on modern Honduras.,1

563,Former Virginia governor Robert F. McDonnell  center is surrounded by media as he walks to the federal courthouse in Richmond.Aug. 11 2014 Former Virginia governor Robert F. McDonnell  center is surrounded by media as he walks to the federal courthouse in Richmond. Bob Brown/Richmond Times-Dispatch via Associated PressFormer Virginia governor Robert F. McDonnell and his wife Maureen are battling a 14-count public-corruption indictment that alleges they lent the prestige of the governor’s office to a Richmond area businessman in exchange for gifts and loans.Gov. Robert F. McDonnell was supposed to be in the thick of the race to succeed him. Instead the Republican found himself relegated to the role of passive observer keeping busy with other engagements amid a gifts scandal. Here are some photos of McDonnell’s time in office as his four-year term comes to a close.Gov. Robert F. McDonnell was supposed to be in the thick of the race to succeed him. Instead the Republican found himself relegated to the role of passive observer keeping busy with other engagements amid a gifts scandal. Here are some photos of McDonnell’s time in office as his four-year term comes to a close.Federal prosecutors told Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell last week that he and his wife would be charged in connection with a gift scandal but senior Justice Department officials delayed the decision after the McDonnells’ attorneys made a face-to-face appeal in Washington according to people familiar with the case.Dana J. Boente the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia told the McDonnells’ legal teams that he planned to ask a grand jury to return an indictment no later than this past Monday people familiar with the conversations said.McDonnell (R) and his wife Maureen would have been charged with working together to illegally promote a struggling dietary-supplement company in exchange for gifts and loans from its chief executive the people said.The plan to seek the felony charges this week changed however after attorneys for the state’s first couple met with Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole on Dec. 12.The attorneys argued that the governor had done nothing improper to assist businessman Jonnie R. Williams Sr. In particular they focused on the credibility of a key witness said a person familiar with the presentation. They also argued that if prosecutors proceeded with charges they should wait until after McDonnell left office Jan. 11 to allow a smooth transition of power to Gov.-elect Terry McAuliffe (D).Some element of the lawyers’ arguments apparently persuaded the Justice Department to delay according to people with knowledge of the case. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case.On Friday the day after the meeting McDonnell’s attorneys were told that the decision would be put on hold the people said. A final decision about whether to press charges is now not expected before Jan. 2 and could come as late as February they said.Jason Miyares a spokesman for McDonnell’s legal team and William A. Burck an attorney for McDonnell’s wife declined to comment. Boente and a spokesman for the Justice Department also declined to comment. McDonnell has maintained that he has done nothing wrong.It is not unusual that a high-profile target especially a sitting governor would be allowed a chance to appeal a U.S. attorney’s charging decision to top officials of the Justice Department. It would be very rare however for the Justice Department to ultimately overturn a decision made by a U.S. attorney.Relationship probedFederal prosecutors have been investigating the McDonnells’ relationship with Williams for most of this year. Williams provided more than $165000 in gifts and loans to the governor and his family. The gifts came as the McDonnells took steps to promote Williams’s company Star Scientific Inc. including hosting a lunch at the Executive Mansion to mark the launch of a new product. The McDonnells also helped company executives secure meetings with state officials.McDonnell has apologized for the relationship but he insisted that he treated Star just as he would have any other Virginia-based business. The company received no state grants contracts or board appointments.He has said in several recent interviews that he would like to see the investigation concluded as quickly as possible.“I’m hoping it will all be resolved in the very near future” he told The Washington Post last month.But privately as prosecutors signaled their intent to file charges McDonnell’s attorneys have been pressing Justice Department officials to reconsider or delay — at least long enough for McDonnell to complete his four-year term and avoid becoming the first sitting governor in state history to face criminal charges.The investigation has focused on whether McDonnell violated the Hobbs Act which makes it a federal crime for a public official to receive payments or other financial gifts knowing that those payments are in return for the official’s promise to take action in his government role.To prove the crime it is not necessary to show that the public official actually took the steps or that any of the official acts resulted in benefits to the person making the payments. Private citizens can also be charged under the law if they caused the public official to take actions or make such promises.McDonnell is also the subject of a state investigation into whether his annual financial disclosures complied with Virginia law. It is a misdemeanor under Virginia law for an elected official to knowingly submit false or incomplete information on annual financial disclosure forms.McDonnell has said he complied with state law which allows elected officials to accept gifts of any value provided they disclose those worth more than $50; they are not required to disclose gifts to their families or loans to their businesses.Attorneys working for Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II (R) learned in March 2012 of allegations that McDonnell’s forms might be incomplete. As required by law Cuccinelli designated a local prosecutor to conduct a full investigation turning the case over to Richmond Commonwealth’s Attorney Michael Herring in November 2012.But Virginia law requires prosecutors to press charges within a year of being alerted to possible legal violations. That statute of limitations is expiring which has become a factor in both the state and federal investigations.Herring had reached an agreement with McDonnell’s attorneys to extend the statute of limitations into this month said a person familiar with its terms. But the state probe has been on hold while federal prosecutors decided whether to proceed with more serious felony charges and federal prosecutors felt pressured by the looming state deadline the person said.On Friday all sides agreed to extend the deal on the state charges — known as a tolling agreement — into early February. That allows more time for federal authorities to make a final decision.Herring would not comment on the federal probe other than to say that he is “awaiting a final decision from the Justice Department.”“But” he added “I have to plan for other contingencies as well such as the matter being returned back to my office.” Herring would not provide information on the tolling agreement.Witnesses at issueThe McDonnells’ attorneys argued to the Justice Department last week that key witnesses were problematic a person close to the case said.Among other issues the attorneys have been telling federal prosecutors that there could be weaknesses in the testimony of Mary Shea Sutherland the former chief of staff to Maureen McDonnell.E-mails obtained under a freedom of information request show that Sutherland was intimately involved in the planning of an event held at the governor’s mansion in August 2011 that marked the launch of a Star Scientific dietary supplement called Anatabloc.Prosecutors believe that the luncheon event was one way the couple helped Williams’s company people with knowledge of the case said.Attorneys for the McDonnells have argued that they could convince a jury that Sutherland was trying to curry favor with Williams including by helping to organize the mansion event according to a person close to the case.Sutherland corresponded with Star Scientific executives before the company issued a news release touting the event. She also urged the governor’s scheduler to ensure that the governor attended. When the scheduler suggested that McDonnell might be busy Sutherland wrote back “The [first lady] isn’t going to be happy about it.”In that same time frame Sutherland was given an expensive dress by Williams on a New York City shopping trip during which Williams also bought $15000 in high-end clothing for the first lady the people said.The defense attorneys also point to a draft of a 2011 contract they said shows that Williams and Sutherland were in negotiations for Sutherland to leave her government job and work for Williams through an independent event planning firm.The employment contract was never executed. Ted Bruns an attorney for Sutherland declined to comment. He has previously said Sutherland never worked for Williams and has called the idea that Sutherland attended a Star event without the first lady’s knowledge “curious.”The event was held at the governor’s 200-year-old official residence and the first lady served as host. The governor attended as well. It was paid for by the governor’s political action committee.Asked about the Star Scientific mansion event in March a spokesman for the governor said all requests for use of the mansion are approved by the governor’s chief of staff. “The decision to have the event was based solely on the benefit to the Commonwealth” spokesman Jeff Caldwell said in a statement then.Matt Zapotosky contributed to this report.,0

565,Benjamin Jealous says if Republicans want to draw black votes addressing inequities of mass incarceration is a place to start.Story highlights Benjamin Jealous: Rand Paul's attempt to heal rift between blacks and GOP fell short He says if GOP wants to draw black votes it can start by committing to civil rights One way is criminal justice reform Jealous says Jealous: Sentencing reform education would bring down spending. GOP get on boardEditor’s Note: Benjamin Todd Jealous is president and CEO of the NAACP.(CNN) —Earlier this month Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) visited Howard University to take a swing at repairing relations between African Americans and the Republican Party.As famed sportscaster Harry Kalas would have said it was largely a swing and a miss.Paul struck out when he tried to equate today’s Republican Party with the party of Abraham Lincoln while ignoring much of the 150 years in between. (He even acknowledged his mistakes shortly after). But his willingness to step up to the plate can provide a lesson for a GOP struggling to get on top.Republicans will not win black votes by paying lip service to party history while attacking social programs and voting rights. But they can make inroads by showing a commitment to civil rights something Paul managed to do briefly in his remarks.Paul received applause when he told the Howard crowd “We should not have drug laws or a court system that disproportionately punishes the black community.” He illustrated using one issue where the GOP can connect with black voters: criminal justice reform.Benjamin Todd JealousJust before the 2012 elections the NAACP took a nonpartisan survey of black voters in key swing states. We found that 55% of African Americans believe Republicans “don’t care at all about civil rights” while another 32% think the party “just says what minorities want to hear.” But 14% said they would be more likely to vote for a Republican in the future if they found a candidate who demonstrated a strong commitment to civil rights.Mass incarceration is a fundamental civil rights issue. African Americans make up 40% of the 2.4 million people in America’s bloated prison system. That includes the vast majority of those in prison for nonviolent drug offenses. If current trends continue one in three black males born today can expect to spend time in prison during his life.As Paul demonstrated mass incarceration is also a fundamental conservative issue. State spending on prisons has tripled over the last 30 years reaching $70 billion in 2008. Federal prisons are at 139% capacity often thanks to harsh mandatory minimum sentences. And who pays for all these guards beds and three square meals a day? Taxpayers.In fact some red states have led the way on criminal justice reform. In Georgia South Carolina and Texas Republican legislatures have teamed up with progressives to increase options for parole and reduce mandatory minimums. In Texas the NAACP and progressive activists worked with leaders of the Tea Party to pass a dozen reform measures. Last year Texas scheduled the first prison closure in state history.Get our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and FacebookRand Paul is not the first national Republican leader to speak up either. Newt Gingrich and Jeb Bush are both members of the conservative think tank Right on Crime. And in 2011 Gingrich joined Grover Norquist and other unlikely allies - including Mike Jiminez the president of California’s prison guard union – to endorse the NAACP’s report Misplaced Priorities: Over Incarcerate Under Educate. The report revealed how the rise in prison spending has caused states to spend less on education.These alliances should draw the attention of Republican leaders. Many Democrats shy away from talking about criminal justice reform for fear of being labeled “soft on crime.” According to the NAACP’s election survey 42% of African American voters believe the Democratic Party is failing them on criminal justice. The GOP has a chance to fill the leadership vacuum and demonstrate their civil rights bona fides.Paul is poised to lead the conversation on criminal justice reform. At Howard he touted the “Justice Safety Valve Act of 2013” which he recently introduced with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy the Democratic senator from Vermont. The bill would allow federal judges to bypass federal mandatory minimum sentences if the sentence is too lengthy or if it simply does not fit the crime.Paul told students that his friends called him “either brave or crazy” for showing up at Howard University a statement that says more about his friends than the audience at Howard. Nonetheless Paul and his Republican Party would display true bravery and political savvy by taking this opportunity to walk Lincoln’s walk and take on the new Jim Crow.Moving from “tough on crime” to “smart on crime” would be good for this country. It would also be a smart move for the Republican Party if they ever hope to get on base with black voters.Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Benjamin Todd Jealous.,0
566,"A staffer to Texas Republican Rep. Steve Stockman says that he not only ""debunked"" the claim that poor families could go hungry if Congress cuts billions in funding for food stamps but that the program could use an additional 12% cut.Being poor is easy especially when you’re not. Or at least that seems to be the lesson from a Republican House aide’s experiment with the Food Stamp Challenge.On Tuesday Donny Ferguson—the communications director and agriculture policy adviser for Texas Rep. Steve Stockman—”debunked” the claim that poor families would go hungry if Congress cut billions in funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) according to a statement by Stockman’s office. In order to prove his point Ferguson spent a week living off a food budget of only $31.50 roughly a quarter of the $133.42 which the average food stamp recipient receives in a month.“I wanted to personally experience the effects of the proposed cuts to food stamps” said Ferguson in the statement. “I didn’t plan ahead or buy strategically I just saw the publicity stunt and made a snap decision to drive down the street and try it myself. I put my money where my mouth is and the proposed food stamp cuts are still quite filling.”Ferguson’s self-imposed $31.50 food budget emulated a similar challenge undertaken by 26 House Democrats last week. But those lawmakers took on the challenge as a way of protesting the $20.5 billion in cuts to SNAP benefits currently being debated in the House.“Feeding a family on SNAP is difficult as it is and it would become virtually impossible if these cuts are implemented” said Rep. Doris Matsui D-Calif. in a statement. “That is why I am taking the SNAP Challenge to promote awareness for hunger and highlight the importance of this critical program.”But according to Ferguson there’s plenty of room for cuts.“Not only did I buy a week’s worth of food on what Democrats claim is too little I have money left over” he said. “Based on my personal experience with SNAP benefit limits we have room to cut about 12% more.”New York City Coalition Against Hunger executive director Joel Berg who has undergone similar challenges twice called Ferguson’s claims “preposterous.”“If he’d like to swap lives with a food stamp recipient for a year I can find 47 million people who would like to take him up on that offer” he said. The problem is that living on a SNAP-level budget does not provide any sense of what it’s truly like to rely on the program.“The longer you do this the harder it is to do the harder it is to make time to shop and the further you go into debt” said Berg. SNAP benefits are allotted monthly and the average recipient usually runs low on funds after the second week.In part that’s because the average recipient isn’t young healthy single and employed. About 47% of all households receiving SNAP benefits include children according to the USDA [PDF]. Additionally 16.5% of households on food stamps include elderly individuals and 20% of households include disabled people. Ferguson’s press release gives no indication that he’s feeding anyone other than himself.“If he had kids would he be proud feeding his family with what he bought? I suspect not” said Berg who noted that Ferguson’s shopping list included no fresh fruit or vegetables. “He seems to be promoting a pretty unhealthy diet a strong recipe for heart disease and diabetes.”Ferguson posted online a photo of his shopping receipts along with a spreadsheet of a meal-by-meal breakdown of what he ate during the week. Included in his shopping list were two liters of root beer a large box of popsicles eight cups of applesauce and two cans of refried beans.“I could have bought cheaper vegetables instead of prepared red beans and rice but I like red beans and rice” said Ferguson in his statement. “Folks aren’t buying fast food instead of vegetables because of benefit limits they’re buying fast food because fast food tastes great and vegetables taste like vegetables.”",1
567,Raw StoryA law is advancing through the Wisconsin state legislature that would double the job-seeking requirements for people collecting unemployment and which would allow the government to peer into their bank accounts and freeze them if they believe the account holder has received overpayments in their benefits. According to the Wisconsin State Journal the co-authors of the bill which was introduced in the state Assembly and Senate on Friday insist that the changes would be for workers’ own good. “This is to protect the workers and lessen the burden on employers who are paying all the bills” said state Rep. Dan Knodl (R-Germantown). ------- Democratic state Rep. Christine Sinicki (Milwaukee) said that the law is another salvo by Republicans against working people and the middle class. She also worried that Republicans would make the bill even more intrusive and draconian during the legislative mark-up process.This is yet another outrageous assault on working people and the unemployed.I was working last week. I got my layoff/separation notice Friday. I am unemployed Monday. It's the 6th time I have been laid off in 20 years and the 4 time since I bought my home and the 3rd time since I got married.Republicans have elevated blaming the victims of capitalism to a high art. And the Unemployed are VICTIMS of GOP economic policies.It would force job applicants to apply for twice as many jobs to remain eligible for benefits. Currently employment seekers must apply for two jobs per week to keep unemployment benefits flowing. The new law raises that number to four.There are no jobs. Republicans worked to kill jobs the Obama administration had set up - killed rail projects as a 2-fer: no rail for efficient transport (aids big oil and big auto and big credit) and killed jobs.Wall Street and the 1% are off-shoring TRILLIONS of dollars APPLE wants laws changed so it can bring billions of untaxed dollars into the US and republicans want to spy on back accounts of the POOR?It's wholly mean-spirited part of the GOP agenda to be as mean and awful to the poor as possible.It is unacceptable.,0
568,This week many publications focused on the need to close the indefinite detention center at Guantanamo Bay and the ongoing hunger strikes there.From The Nation:“I don’t want these individuals to die” Obama told reporters on April 30 adding that “the Pentagon is trying to manage the situation as best as they can.” He also recommitted to closing Guantánamo calling on Congress to “step up and help.” It’s true that lawmakers on both sides have fought hard to make transfers impossible. But Obama’s words ignored how his own policies set the stage for the crisis. “He has said the right thing before” Guantánamo lawyer Pardiss Kebriaei of the Center for Constitutional Rights told The Nation. “It’s time now for action.” The CCR is calling on Obama to end his “self-imposed moratorium” on releasing Yemenis and resume prisoner transfers. It has also called for Obama to appoint a senior official to “shepherd the process of closure.” As the hunger strike approaches its hundredth day on May 17 more than 100 of Guantánamo’s 166 prisoners are refusing food. The president must start living up to his rhetoric about closing the prison the CCR warns or “the men who are on hunger strike will die and he will be ultimately responsible for their deaths.”Some progress has been made. The detainee population is down to 166 from a peak of nearly 800. Of the prisoners who remain 46 are deemed too dangerous to let go but impossible to prosecute even under the looser standards of military commissions for lack of evidence or because evidence is compromised by torture. If released or repatriated there's a high probability they'd resume jihad. What to do with this group — prisoners of war in a war without end — is a question with no satisfactory answer. They have to be held. But both Obama and Congress could do more to winnow down the rest including 86 prisoners cleared for transfer three years ago who remain incarcerated. If Obama is still serious about closing Guantanamo there are obvious steps he can take many without congressional assent.More analysis below the fold.,0

570,Raw StoryA law is advancing through the Wisconsin state legislature that would double the job-seeking requirements for people collecting unemployment and which would allow the government to peer into their bank accounts and freeze them if they believe the account holder has received overpayments in their benefits. According to the Wisconsin State Journal the co-authors of the bill which was introduced in the state Assembly and Senate on Friday insist that the changes would be for workers’ own good. “This is to protect the workers and lessen the burden on employers who are paying all the bills” said state Rep. Dan Knodl (R-Germantown). ------- Democratic state Rep. Christine Sinicki (Milwaukee) said that the law is another salvo by Republicans against working people and the middle class. She also worried that Republicans would make the bill even more intrusive and draconian during the legislative mark-up process.This is yet another outrageous assault on working people and the unemployed.I was working last week. I got my layoff/separation notice Friday. I am unemployed Monday. It's the 6th time I have been laid off in 20 years and the 4 time since I bought my home and the 3rd time since I got married.Republicans have elevated blaming the victims of capitalism to a high art. And the Unemployed are VICTIMS of GOP economic policies.It would force job applicants to apply for twice as many jobs to remain eligible for benefits. Currently employment seekers must apply for two jobs per week to keep unemployment benefits flowing. The new law raises that number to four.There are no jobs. Republicans worked to kill jobs the Obama administration had set up - killed rail projects as a 2-fer: no rail for efficient transport (aids big oil and big auto and big credit) and killed jobs.Wall Street and the 1% are off-shoring TRILLIONS of dollars APPLE wants laws changed so it can bring billions of untaxed dollars into the US and republicans want to spy on back accounts of the POOR?It's wholly mean-spirited part of the GOP agenda to be as mean and awful to the poor as possible.It is unacceptable.,0

572,With the government shutdown finally concluded the threat of a strike on Syria on the back burner and no serious chance that the U.S. will default on its debts for at least the next 3 1/2 months perhaps Congress can pull itself together and get back to work on stalled legislation. It should begin by tackling comprehensive immigration reform.After all much of the heavy lifting on this complicated and controversial issue has been done. Earlier this year the Senate passed a sweeping bipartisan bill that calls for allowing more high-skilled and low-skilled workers into the U.S. while also establishing a new guest-worker program that includes additional protections for farm workers. It would set out a 13-year path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally but only after they paid fines and passed a background check and after additional border security measures were put in place. It’s not a perfect plan but it takes the kind of broad approach that is needed to restructure the dysfunctional system.The Republican-led House however has not signed on opting instead for a piecemeal approach. Among the separate proposals waiting to reach the floor are an enforcement bill known as the SAFE Act which would for the first time designate as criminals all immigrants in the U.S. illegally and would allow states such as Arizona to enforce their own immigration laws. Another bill would create a new guest-worker program that would likely please growers but leave farm laborers unprotected from abusive employers. Two other bills would expand the use of federal databases to verify the immigration status of new employees.The two sides are far apart obviously. But there is some reason for hope after months of stalemate. In an effort to repair some of the political damage the GOP inflicted on itself during the shutdown some House Republicans apparently are calling for action on immigration reform to win back moderate support. If the House approved just one of its piecemeal bills it could move to a conference committee where Senate and House members could begin to reconcile their differences. If it goes that route the House should pass its border security measure which is the best of the bills introduced so far. But it’s unclear whether Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) will allow any of the bills to move forward.AdvertisementThe reality is that the current immigration system isn’t working for American employers who rely on the low-wage labor that comes in over the border or for the millions of immigrants stuck in the underground economy. That’s why a broad coalition of religious law enforcement and business leaders has repeatedly called for a compromise.Immigration reform can still be achieved if only GOP lawmakers stop stalling stop grandstanding and get to work.,0
573,There are two good things to say about the Working Families Flexibility Act which passed the House this week with 220 Republican and three Democratic votes.One the bill is bound to go nowhere in the Senate and two even if it did advance the White House has threatened to veto it.The bill in brief is worse than meritless; it is a fraud. According to its Republican backers it’s an expression in legislative form of how much they care for families work-life balance and in particular working women. If this is caring I would hate to see what contempt looks like.The bill would amend long-standing labor law by allowing private-sector employers to offer compensatory time off in lieu of time-and-a-half pay for overtime. Employers and workers are supposed to agree on the arrangement but there is nothing to stop an employer from discriminating against those who prefer payment by cutting back on their overtime hours. Nor would employers face any real deterrent against forcing unpaid overtime on workers who fear losing their jobs if they object. The recourse for coerced workers would be to sue a far-fetched and unaffordable option for most people.For employers then the bill is a way to impose extra work at no additional cost effectively shifting what would otherwise be worker pay into corporate profits.For employees who won’t work overtime without extra compensation the likely result would be fewer hours and overall less pay. For those who will the likely result would be greater unpredictability in scheduling which only creates more work stress as well as higher costs for work related expenses like child care but with no additional money to meet those expenses.Now what about having more time off? Under the bill employees can use their comp time only at the employer’s convenience. If employees are unable to get timely approval for using the comp time or decide not to use it they can ask to cash it in at which point the employer has 30 days to pay up.The bill’s Republican supporters have stressed that government workers can accrue comp time in place of overtime pay implying that private sector workers are missing out on a perk enjoyed by cossetted public sector workers. Wrong. Government employers don’t need to turn a profit and thus do not have the same incentive as private sector employers to push workers into unpaid overtime. Government employees who tend to be in unions — as well as private sector unionized workers — also have contracts with safeguards around alternative work and pay arrangements.For the record there are many ways for Congress to improve both worker pay and work life balance including raising the minimum wage instituting paid sick leave ending discriminatory pay practices easing the formation of unions and promoting advance notice for worker scheduling. The House bill ignores what is helpful and embraces what is harmful.,1
574,At an immigration reform rally in San Francisco Monday President Obama confronted a heckler who demanded that he stop all deportations. (Associated Press)At an immigration reform rally in San Francisco Monday President Obama confronted a heckler who demanded that he stop all deportations. (Associated Press)The young man’s plea was direct: Stop the deportations he urged President Obama of the 11.5 million illegal immigrants in the United States.“You have the power to stop deportations for all” the man said as he interrupted Obama’s immigration policy speech here Monday afternoon.“Actually” the president replied “I don’t. And that’s why we’re here.”He added “The easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws. And what I’m proposing is the harder path which is to use our democratic processes to achieve the same goal that you want to achieve — but it won’t be as easy as just shouting. It requires us lobbying and getting it done.”Hecklers have become a staple at Obama’s public events but it’s rare that one underscores the message that the president is trying to deliver — in this instance that the American people support a path to citizenship for those here illegally but that Congress is blocking comprehensive immigration reform.Obama came to San Francisco’s Chinatown on Monday to argue that overhauling the immigration system would bring an economic windfall for the Bay Area and other communities nationwide. In remarks at the Betty Ann Ong Chinese Recreation Center Obama said 35 percent of business owners in San Francisco are immigrants many of them Asian Americans.“You don’t have to be an economist to figure out that workers will be more productive if they’ve got their families here with them — they’re not worried about deportation they’re not living halfway around the world” Obama said. “This isn’t just the right thing to do. It’s the smart thing to do.”Obama urged House Republicans to take up the Senate’s compromise immigration bill saying that progress on this front is being held up by a faction of the Republican Party. He also reiterated his support for a piecemeal approach in the House if that is what it would take to pass a package of reforms.But Obama also said “Just because something is smart fair good for the economy and supported by business labor law enforcement and faith leaders Democratic and Republican governors including the governor of this state — just because all that is in place doesn’t mean we’ll actually get it done because this is Washington after all that we’re talking about and everything’s looked at through a political prism.”Brendan Buck a spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said “The speaker is sincere in wanting to get something done and we’re pleased the president said he can accept the step-by-step approach we’re taking in the House.”In addition to immigration Obama touched briefly on the troubled rollout of the federal government’s health insurance exchange. California has signed up tens of thousands of people through its own exchange.“Even as we’re getting this darn Web site up to speed — and it’s getting better — states like California are proving the law works” Obama said referring to the federal insurance Web site.,0
575,Last year when the Supreme Court struck down the noxious Arizona law known as SB 1070 it sent a clear message to states seeking to enact their own immigration laws: Don’t do it.The court ruled that the law which in effect sought to bully undocumented immigrants into leaving the state was an unconstitutional intrusion by a state government into an arena — immigration policy — that is the responsibility of the federal government.But apparently the high court’s decision has done little to diminish support for such laws in Hazleton Pa. and Farmers Branch Texas where officials have spent millions defiantly defending local housing ordinances intended to regulate immigration.In Hazleton’s case the city adopted an ordinance in 2006 that would have turned landlords into criminals if they rented to immigrants lacking legal status. Two courts including the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals have struck down the measure finding it both discriminatory and an infringement on the federal government’s sole authority over immigration.AdvertisementAnd an en banc review by the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals found that the Farmers Branch law which required city officials to deny “occupancy licenses” to renters if it was found they were in the country illegally similarly interfered with the federal government’s authority.Now both cities are asking the Supreme Court to review the lower-court decisions that invalidated their ordinances. Supporters argue that these laws regulate housing not immigration and therefore do not interfere with federal authority. They cite a Nebraska law allowing such housing restrictions that was upheld this year by a circuit court.That argument is specious. Laws that punish immigrants who are in the country illegally for trying to find a place to live or that require landlords to check the immigration status of prospective tenants or that mandate that renters register with the city and provide proof of their legal status are clearly intended to regulate immigration. In fact these laws rely on the same “attrition by enforcement” strategy that Arizona employed when it tried to force immigrants out of the state by making their day-to-day lives so harsh that they would self-deport.Local regulations certainly can and do interfere with the federal government’s authority. As District Judge James Munley wrote in 2007 when he struck down Hazleton’s ordinance it “is difficult to conceive of a more effective method of ensuring that persons do not enter or remain in a locality than by precluding their ability to live in a place.” If the federal government is to have authority over who stays and who is deported it must have that power in every state and city.AdvertisementThe Supreme Court should deny both cities’ requests for review and in so doing remind local officials that immigration reform is Congress’ job — if only lawmakers would step up and do it.,0

Rick Perry a Republican this month has written at least 13 manufacturers in states from Oregon to New York saying his state would not impose ""unwarranted government intrusion into your business.""Rep. Jeff Duncan R-S.C. has written manufacturers in New York and Colorado inviting them to relocate. Idaho economic development officials and Mississippi's Republican speaker of the House also have written similar letters.""The enemies of freedom are waging an all-out assault on the Second Amendment to the Constitution which we have sworn to protect and defend"" said Duncan's letter to George Kollitides chief executive officer of Freedom Group Inc. whose Remington Arms division has a manufacturing plant in Ilion N.Y. ""At a time when our government is consistently thwarting the ability of individuals to own businesses voluntarily trade goods and services and grow our economy South Carolina is committed to a different story. In South Carolina we believe in the right to keep and bear arms.""Duncan also wrote the chief operating officer of Magpul a Colorado company that makes ammunition magazines gun stocks and other custom add-ons for semi-automatic rifles that President Obama and some members of Congress led by Sen. Dianne Feinstein D-Calif. want to ban. Colorado's legislature is contemplating several gun-control measures including limiting ammunition magazines to 15 rounds.When the legislation first came to light Magpul officials told the Denver Post they would consider leaving the state if the measure to limit rounds in magazines became law saying it would be difficult doing business in a state that banned its products. Other companies that supply Magpul have since said they would follow if Magpul left.Repeated attempts to reach Magpul officials were unsuccessful. So were attempts to reach a spokesperson for Remington Arms which was founded in upstate New York but is now headquartered in North Carolina.New York last month passed one of the most restrictive gun laws in the nation which among other things banned assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. When he signed it Gov. Andrew Cuomo a Democrat stressed that the new restrictions would not affect rifles and shotguns used by hunters.In an interview Duncan said that was not the point.""This isn't about deer hunting"" he said. ""The Second Amendment is about our right to keep and bear arms to defend ourselves.""Rob Godfrey a spokesman for South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley a Republican said that ""while we appreciate Congressman Duncan's leadership and economic development efforts we don't discuss details of ongoing talks with any company that may be interested in moving to South Carolina.""The Colorado House has passed several gun-related measures including limiting ammunition magazines to 15 rounds. Gov.

""We are adding a lot of jobs.""One company approached by Perry the Texas governor already has said no.Crimson Trace Corp. of Wilsonville Ore. which makes laser-sighting systems for handguns will stay put. Kent Thomas director of marketing for the company said the firm is happy with the ""entrepreneurial spirit of Oregon"" and that ""there is no reason for us to move.""Bills to ban the sale of high-capacity magazines and assault rifles were introduced in the Oregon legislature but they have stalled. State Sen. Floyd Prozanski a Democrat and chairman of the Judiciary Committee said last week he would not take up either bill because they were issues that Congress should deal with.Some states that have robust outdoors industries have been trying to attract gun and ammunition manufacturers for years.Even before the most recent escalation in the gun-violence debate following the murder of 20 children and six adults in December in Newtown Conn. Idaho was trying to attract companies ""not only within the arms and ammunition sector but broader — companies that fall within what we call recreational technology"" said Megan Ronk spokeswoman for the Idaho Department of Commerce. The best way to explain the state's business targets she said: makers of any products sold at Cabela's a leading outdoors hunting and fishing retailer.Ronk said that as other states consider gun restrictions ""that creates some advantages for us.

577,"The Associated Press is being accused of trying to influence the immigration debate following a decision to stop using the term ""illegal immigrant"" in its coverage -- despite the fact it is still being used by U.S. government officials including Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano.The decision comes as a bipartisan group of senators prepares to introduce sweeping immigration legislation which is expected to propose a pathway to citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants.Indeed the move by the influential wire service is being hailed as a victory by immigrant advocacy groups.The conservative Media Research Center though described the change as a ""politically-correct mumble.""The new style guideline was first announced this week on the wire service’s blog by Senior Vice President and Executive Editor Kathleen Carroll who said the change came out of conversations with people who opposed the term.“Our goal always is to use the most precise and accurate words so that the meaning is clear to any reader anywhere” Carroll said.“The Stylebook no longer sanctions the term ‘illegal immigrant’ or the use of ‘illegal’ to describe a person” Carroll said. “Instead it tells users that ‘illegal’ should describe only an action such as living in or immigrating to a country illegally.”Still some are wondering why the AP decided to nix the phrase when high-ranking government officials don’t seem to have a problem with it.Last week Napolitano told reporters that she didn’t “really get caught up in the vocabulary wars.”“They are immigrants who are here illegally that’s an illegal immigrant” she said.Previously the AP rejected the term “undocumented immigrants” favored by some activists as inaccurate.Changes to the AP Stylebook which is updated annually have important and widespread repercussions in the media. The changes don't just influence the AP's writing which is found in publications around the world. The book is the primary writing style guide for journalists in both print and broadcast.The Congressional Hispanic Caucus a group of 27 House Democrats applauded the AP’s decision and called it “a great step forward.”On a more tongue-in-cheek note ALIPAC announced Wednesday it would be changing its “style” preference in all future articles to ""illegal invaders"" -- ""in response to the totalitarian steps by the Associated Press to make 'illegal immigrants' disappear with the stroke of a pen just days before legislation attempting to do the same is expected to be filed in Washington DC by the 'Gang of 8.'""Comedian Jay Leno joked that the phrase should be replaced with ""undocumented Democrat.""The AP said its decision to stop using the term “illegal immigrants” is part of a broader shift away from labeling people and toward labeling behavior -- for example referring to people “diagnosed with schizophrenia” instead of “schizophrenics.”In 1986 the AP’s then-stylebook editor Christopher French used the same reasoning to support the wire service’s decision to use “anti-abortion” instead of “pro-life” and abortion rights instead of “pro-abortion” or “pro-choice.”“Until a specific rule is agreed upon at AP the following existing guideline is being applied: Avoid labeling groups or individuals and instead spend an extra sentence on a more specific description” French said at the time.In February it reversed a decision on gay marriage saying people in same-sex marriages could now be referred to as “husbands” and “wives.”Several news organizations are also dropping the term “illegal immigrant” from their reporting. CNN ABC News and NBC News have all parted ways with the phrase in the past few years.The debate on whether to change the term at The New York Times is still being debated public editor Margaret Sullivan wrote in an article Tuesday.“The Times for the past couple of months has also been considering changes to its stylebook entry on this term and will probably announce them to staff members this week” she wrote.“From what I can gather The Times’s changes will not be nearly as sweeping as The AP’s” Sullivan said adding “I would be surprised to see The Times ban the use of ‘illegal immigrant’ as the AP has done.”",1

Sen. Jon Erpenbach (D-Middleton) said Tuesday's session could mirror one in June when Senate President Mike Ellis (R-Neenah) broke the base of his gavel as he slammed it down to quiet Democrats upset over passing a different abortion bill. Footage of those raucous proceedings was featured in an ad targeting Ellis run by Planned Parenthood Advocates of Wisconsin. Republicans who run the Senate are tentatively planning to approve two abortion bills on Tuesday. One would ban any abortions that are sought because of the sex of the fetus. The other would prevent public employees' health plans from covering most abortions and would also strictly limit the ability of employees of religious organizations to get contraception through their insurance plans.That's right. If you're a public employee you won't be able to get an abortion and if you work for a religious organization (like a hospital) no birth control for you.In case you've forgotten this is how Republicans rammed through these bills in June with only 1 speaker and no debate:Yes Mike Ellis broke his gavel telling Democrats to sit down and shut up.

580,WASHINGTON — In a contentious climax Wednesday to a series of congressional hearings Lois Lerner a key IRS manager invoked her right to not testify about the agency’s targeting of conservative groups igniting howls from Republicans and sparking a threat to bring her back for another round.Deprived of a crucial witness members of Congress from both parties alternately grilled and scolded former Commissioner Douglas Shulman about the Internal Revenue Service’s improper screening of conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status.AdvertisementAlthough new details and documents have emerged about how IRS staff scrutinized organizations for political activity the three hearings on three different days turned up no evidence that the aggressive screening stemmed from partisan motives or was ordered from above either by the White House or by senior IRS management.DOCUMENT: Inspector General’s IRS reportAdvertisementThe hearings launched by the release last week of a scathing inspector general’s report instead have painted a picture of a bungling agency in which top managers in Washington were largely out of touch with how their staff in a Cincinnati field office was handling applications for tax exemptions.Many questions have not been answered including how the improper screening started why it continued on and off for two years and why top IRS officials did not reveal it for more than a year despite pointed questions from Congress and loud complaints from the targeted conservative groups.AdvertisementLerner who still supervises the IRS staff that handles those applications and Shulman appeared Wednesday before the Oversight and Government Reform Committee but provided little illumination.Lerner who revealed the inappropriate targeting two weeks ago read a statement saying she did nothing wrong then invoked her 5th Amendment right to not answer questions. “Because I’m asserting my right not to testify I know that some people will assume that I’ve done something wrong. I have not” she said.AdvertisementPHOTOS: President Obama’s rough weekHer decision did not sit well with Republicans angered that conservative groups including local tea party organizations faced intrusive questions and long delays when they applied for nonprofit status.Advertisement“Ms. Lerner has invoked her constitutional rights not to answer our questions about her involvement or the IRS’ involvement ironically about denying others their constitutional rights” Rep. Michael R. Turner (R-Ohio) said.Lerner noting that the Department of Justice had launched a criminal investigation said her lawyer advised her not to testify. It is relatively rare for witnesses to invoke the 5th Amendment. In April 2012 a federal official refused to answer questions about a lavish conference in Las Vegas. And a year earlier executives of Solyndra invoked the right during a congressional probe of federal grants to their failed solar-energy firm.AdvertisementThe oversight committee chairman Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Vista) excused Lerner but said he may ask her to appear again on the grounds that she may have waived her rights by first offering a defense of her actions.Legal experts were divided on the question. Stanley Brand former general counsel to the U.S. House said other witnesses have made introductory statements before invoking the 5th. But Paul Rothstein a professor of judicial process at Georgetown University Law Center said Lerner is on “pretty thin ice” because her remarks touched on the subject of the hearing.AdvertisementThe IRS did not respond to questions about Lerner.“It’s important to find the facts before you hold people accountable” White House spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday when asked why Lerner was still at the IRS.AdvertisementThe new acting commissioner Daniel Werfel started Wednesday. President Obama asked him to report back in 30 days on what action he had taken to hold accountable staff who acted inappropriately. “There is a commitment here to get to the bottom of what happened” Carney said.Also testifying Wednesday was the first Obama administration official Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal S. Wolin. He said he learned an inspector general’s audit was underway in 2012 but did not learn any details from J. Russell George the Treasury inspector general for tax administration. “I told him that he should follow the facts where they lead. I told him that our job is to stay out of the way and let him do his work” he said.AdvertisementRepublicans and Democrats on the oversight committee without Lerner to question focused most of their attention on Shulman who ran the IRS for five years before leaving in November 2012.Shulman who also testified on Tuesday again said that he never knew much about what his staff was doing to look for political activity in organizations seeking tax exemptions. He said he didn’t take action when he learned about it in early 2012 since he was told the problem had ended.Advertisement“People in your own internal operation knew” Issa told Shulman. “If you didn’t know you were derelict in your duty or your management style was such that you didn’t get informed. Either way that is certainly not something you should be proud of.”Shulman repeatedly parried questions about why he didn’t do more. “At the time I learned about this list I felt I was taking the appropriate actions and I felt my course was the right one and I still feel that way today” he said.AdvertisementMany of the exchanges were testy. Some Republicans trying to build a trail to the White House asked Shulman what he talked about during his frequent visits to the executive mansion.One he pointedly noted was “the Easter Egg roll with [his] kids.” But he said he steered clear of the subject: “It would not have been appropriate to have a conversation with anyone at the White House about the subject of discriminating against conservative groups in any part of our operations.”AdvertisementThe oversight committee staff has begun questioning IRS officials who were directly involved with supervising screeners and obtaining emails from the staff in Cincinnati who dealt with the issue.One of those officials Holly Paz an attorney who worked under Lerner in Washington said she first uncovered the improper screening in June 2011. She said the employees in Cincinnati didn’t realize that using terms such as “tea party” to single out applications crossed the line.Advertisement“They were not even aware of you know politics” she said according to committee staff. “Being outside of Washington it was not something that they followed or had interest in.”Many of the groups were sent letters with intrusive requests for information such as lists of donors and details of their conversations at their events. Paz told the staff that no IRS managers looked at those letters before they went out a practice that has since been changed.Advertisementjoseph.tanfani@latimes.comrichard.simon@latimes.comAdvertisementmelanie.mason@latimes.com,1
581,"8 years agoOxon Hill Maryland (CNN) - Sarah Palin igniting a crowd of conservatives says it's time to stop ""preaching to the choir"" and instead evangelize a grass-roots anti-Washington message to all Americans even those who disagree with the right.""They're not our enemies. They're our sisters and our brothers. They're our neighbors they're our friends. It's imperative to reach out and to share that conservative message of liberty and less government and lower taxes"" the former Alaska governor said urging growth of the movement.[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']Saturday marked Palin's second time to address the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. With the gathering serving as a time for introspection among the Republican Party Palin bucked party leadership and said only real reform can come from the bottom up.""We're not here to re-brand a party we're here to rebuild a country"" she said. ""We're here to restore America and the rest is just theatrics. The rest is sound and fury. It's just making noise.""Palin's comments come two days before the Republican National Committee is scheduled to unveil its conclusions from a months-long ""autopsy"" of the party following its big election losses in November.Walking out to Shania Twain's ""She's Not Just a Pretty Face"" the 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee easily got the crowd on their feet. Her speech was rife with her folksy tough talk and snipes at President Obama. And of course no Palin speech is complete without references to her hunting and outdoors life in Alaska.Take for example an anecdote about her husband buying her a rifle rack for Christmas while she bought him a gun.""This go-around he's got the rifle I've got the rack"" she said.She spurred another wave of cheers and applause while pausing to take a sip from a Big Gulp a not-so-veiled swipe at New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's push against large sugary drinks. ""We're cool. Shoot it's just pop with low calorie ice cubes in it. I hope that's OK.""Not known for pulling her punches Palin also took the opportunity to blast the president and Senate Democrats for failing to get a budget passed in four years.""Barack Obama promised the most transparent administration ever"" she said. ""You lied.""The president she said has turned from ""no drama Obama"" to ""all drama Obama"" in a city that she said operates like a reality television show. She also dinged the president's support for background check legislation.""And background checks yeah I guess to learn more about a person's thinking and associations and intentions? More background checks?"" she said. ""Dandy idea Mr. President. Should have started with yours.""But Palin's most forceful criticism was directed against GOP leaders in Washington.She chided establishment attempts to shape the last election especially in congressional races. While she didn't say his name Palin seemed to take aim at Karl Rove the former top political adviser to George W. Bush who was dubbed the ""architect"" of the former president's campaigns.""If these experts who keep losing elections and keep getting rehired and raking in millions if they feel that strongly about who gets to run in this party then they should buck up or stay in the truck"" she said. ""The architects can head on back.""Rove's groups American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS spent millions in Senate races but had little success in getting their supported candidates elected. They're now facing push-back from tea party conservatives for starting a new group aimed to help electable candidates sail through Republican primaries.Critics say the new move is simply a way to push out conservative voices. For her part Palin was active in backing the more conservative candidate in several Republican primaries last year. Many of her preferred candidates went on to win including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska.With 20 months until the 2014 mid-terms Palin said Washington should not be in the game of hand-picking candidate. She urged the audience to change the ""top-down political process"" and create their own search for the next best crop of contenders.""Now is the time to furlough the consultants tune out the pollsters send the focus groups home and toss the political scripts because if we truly know what we believe we don't need professionals to tell us"" she said adding one final message to Washington.""Get over yourself"" she said. ""It's not about you.""",1
582,By Walter ShapiroIs Barack Obama a liberal?That question might have aroused spirited debate especially among Democrats during the president’s vague-is-in-vogue re-election campaign. But since the polls closed on Nov. 6 President Obama has undeniably positioned himself to the left of Candidate Obama.Amid the national grieving over the Sandy Hook shootings Obama suddenly found the gumption to stare down the NRA and put gun control back on the national agenda. His inaugural address will be remembered for the stirring endorsement of gay rights and the sudden rediscovery of climate change. Then before the inaugural glow wore off the Pentagon announced that it would drop its ban on women in combat. And immigration reform—another explosive topic—is likely to receive a star turn in the upcoming State of the Union address.But before we dust off right-wing commentator Dinesh D’Souza’s absurd claim that Obama is really a Kenyan socialist let’s look more closely at the president’s sudden liberal fervor.Make no mistake Obama is indeed a transformational 21st-century leader when it comes to any issue that touches on individual rights and equality. He reflects the end of the white-bread politics that elected both Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan to two terms. Rather than defying the demographic and attitudinal shifts that produced the America of 2013 Obama embodies them.Some of his liberal statements and actions are undoubtedly payback to the electoral coalition that gave the president a second term despite the stagnant economy. When the first wave of Obama White House memoirs are published it will be fascinating to read about the internal debates over the gay-rights portion of the inaugural address. But maybe in reality there was little dissent. Maybe Obama and his top advisers simply understood that it was time.Any discussion of Obama’s newly expressed passion for gun control has to begin with the fact that this Chicago-shaped politician is our first urban president since John Kennedy. Unlike say Bill Clinton Obama never came from a place where guns are equated with hunting rather than violent shootouts. Remember during the 2008 primary campaign against Hillary Clinton Obama in a private fundraiser derided rural voters who “cling to guns or religion.”When it comes to regulating guns political geography matters. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg may be the nation’s most zealous proponent of gun control but it is hard to describe this billionaire plutocrat who endorsed George W. Bush for president in 2004 as a dangerous left-winger.Immigration reform is another issue with a bipartisan pedigree. The plan that Obama is likely to highlight in his State of the Union address will bear a close resemblance to the legislation that John McCain and Ted Kennedy introduced in 2005 with the blessing of George W. Bush and Karl Rove. It is hard to describe the U.S. Chamber of Commerce which has consistently backed immigration reform as a hotbed of left-wingers.Painting an ideological portrait of any incumbent president is tricky since the subject keeps moving rather than holding a fixed position. All presidencies are filled with contradictions: Ronald Reagan raised taxes; Bush dramatically expanded the social safety net by adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare; and Obama for a while dramatically increased troop levels in Afghanistan.Even now there is a zigzag quality to Obama’s foreign policy. In his inaugural address the president declared “A decade of war is now ending.” But not the vastly expanded drone attacks which have become Obama’s favored way of battling terrorists. To the consternation of liberals Obama has refused to make public the legal justification for this airborne war conducted by robots.The president’s economic orientation can be equally confounding. In an interview after the election Obama claimed “My policies are so mainstream that if I had set the same policies that I had back in the 1980s I would be considered a moderate Republican.” Of course this contention is self-servingly hyperbolic. But Obama’s words do underscore how the political pendulum on economic issues (but decidedly not on social issues) has moved to the right in the past three decades.How liberal is a president who signed the “fiscal cliff” legislation that made permanent the Bush tax cuts for roughly 99 percent of Americans? How liberal is a president who at various points in his budget negotiations with the Republicans has toyed with raising the eligibility age for Medicare and cutting back the inflation adjustment for Social Security? How liberal is a president who allowed the Wall Street masterminds behind the economic collapse to go unpunished for their flagrant misdeeds?Even the big-government complexity of Obamacare was created in large measure because the president refused to endorse the liberal cause of a single-payer system like Medicare. And while not beating the drums for the president’s claim to be a moderate Republican didn’t a Massachusetts governor named Mitt Romney enact an analogous health-care plan?The point is that an inaugural address and a few post-election gestures do not by themselves define who Obama is as a political leader. So far the liberalism of Obama in the personal sphere has been tempered by the centrism of Obama in the economic and foreign-policy realm.This ideological blurriness comes with the keys to the Oval Office. To steal a line from Walt Whitman Obama can rightly say “I am large I contain multitudes.”,1
583,"Alan GomezUSA TODAYGround is %22fertile%22 for immigration revisions when Congress returns in 2014Republicans have said immigration legislation is a priority in the new yearHowever%2C some Republicans in the House still opposed to amnestyWASHINGTON — If the Senate manages to pass a long-term budget deal Tuesday the next item on the agenda for Congress could be even harder: immigration.Republican leaders led by House Speaker John Boehner R-Ohio have deemed immigration legislation a priority in the new year. The Senate is expected to pass Tuesday a bipartisan budget deal for the next two years that would clear the legislative calendar and eliminate the threat of a government shutdown in January. And even Bob Dane whose Federation for American Immigration Reform strongly opposes a bill concedes that at this point ""the ground is very fertile"" for an immigration bill.""It's going to happen"" Vice President Biden said during a webinar last week.However whether that momentum leads to a sweeping rewrite of the nation's immigration laws could have more to do with the 2014 elections than current conditions.The biggest roadblock to legislation has been and will continue to be Republicans in the House who oppose a deal similar to that passed by the Senate allowing the nation's 12 million undocumented immigrants to apply for U.S. citizenship. Dane says an already-fractured GOP must stand firm in opposition if it wants to have any success come election day.""Opposing amnesty next year is probably the last hope for the GOP to save itself from losing a core group of its voters"" Dane said.Despite their public support of immigration revisions Republican House leaders accomplished little in 2013.The Senate passed its comprehensive rewrite of the nation's immigration laws in June including $46 billion in border security and an overhaul of the legal immigration system to bring in more high-tech and low-skilled workers.House committees have approved five bills that focus on immigration enforcement and expanding the legal immigration system to bring in more foreign workers. But the last of those bills was approved in June; none of them have been brought to the House floor. No Republicans have introduced a bill that deals with the undocumented population.Some House Republicans are pushing their colleagues to get those bills moving.Reps. David Valadao R-Calif. and Jeff Denham R-Calif. have been pressing Republicans to sign onto a letter they hope to present to Boehner in January supporting action on immigration legislation.Denham would not specify how many signatures they've garnered so far but he said there is a surprising level of interest among his GOP colleagues.""We've been getting a good percentage of our conference signing on"" he said.Denham said they'd have even more signatories but some supportive Republicans are reluctant out of fear of primary season. Conservative groups have made clear that they will support more conservative GOP candidates against lawmakers who back the Senate bill so adding their name to the letter could lead to easy attack ads.""It puts a target on their back"" Denham said.Some also see Boehner's repudiation of outside conservative groups as his chamber passed the budget deal last week as evidence that he might be willing to push an immigration bill that isn't supported by the Tea Party wing of his party.""It shows that Boehner wants to get things done and he's not going to be held hostage by the extreme right"" said Ali Noorani executive director of the National Immigration Forum a group that supports the Senate bill and has spent the past year encouraging rank-and-file Republicans to embrace it. ""You win the conference you win leadership and we're getting closer and closer to winning the conference.""In the meantime immigration advocates have turned up the pressure on Republicans in the House.Supporters completed a weeks-long fast for immigration changes on Friday with several members of Congress joining for 24-hour water-only fasts. But the tactics of immigration supporters have grown more and more confrontational.Young undocumented immigrants interrupted Boehner while he was having breakfast several weeks ago they've staked out the home of Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor R-Va. and have held nearly constant protests outside Majority Whip Rep. Kevin McCarthy's office in California.Last week immigration supporters held sit-ins in the congressional offices of two-dozen representatives.Those moves irked some in Congress. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart R-Fla. has been pushing for new immigration laws for years and said protests aimed at so many members of Congress – including himself and other supporters – are ""not exactly contributing to get this done.""But others like Rep. Luis Gutierrez D-Ill. said he's not surprised by their impatience and expects it to continue when Congress returns to Washington in January.""They're angry they're disillusioned they're hurt so you shouldn't expect them to come bringing flowers and roses"" Gutierrez said. ""You should expect them to come here angry.""",0
584,WASHINGTON D.C. — Nearly half of the crowd at Saturday’s Elite 8 game between Syracuse and Marquette at the Verizon Center in Washington D.C. booed President Barack Obama when he was shown on the big screen with just over ten minutes to play in the first half. After the boos erupted a contingent of Obama supporters countered with cheers.Obama also golfed on Saturday for the first time since the sequester cuts went into effect at the beginning of March and then took some of his foursome–and his Secret Service detail–to watch Syracuse oust Marquette and secure a trip to the Final Four.One would have expected a friendlier crowd for the President but there are still several possible explanations for the boos. Obama and his White House team had supported Georgetown (Syracuse’s rival) in the past and the President had forecast Indiana (who was eliminated by Syracuse) to win the East Regional and go on to win the national title for example. Or perhaps they booed because POTUS had gone to the game with Secret Service agents while the White House remains closed to tours.The Obama administration canceled the popular White House tours citing Secret Service costs. Throughout the week Obama has been scrutinized because of Secret Service expenditures for the First Daughters’ vacations to the Bahamas and Sun Valley Idaho.***UPDATE: Twitterers confirm Breitbart News’s report that President Obama was booed at the Marquette vs. Syracuse game (time stamps on tweets are Eastern Daylight Time):[Mark Packer is Host of College Sports Today on SiriusXM.][Marshall Henderson plays basketball for the Ole Miss Rebels.][Lance Allan is Sports Anchor for Today’s TMJ4 NBC’s Milwaukee affiliate.][Rob Dauster is Head Writer for College Basketball Talk.]***This story has been updated.Cole Muzio and Tony Lee contributed to this report.photo credit: John Pudner,1
585,Spring Break is a common ritual for students across the country and First Daughter Malia Obama is no exception. But of course there is an important difference between the First Daughter and other students. When Malia Obama takes a trip the American taxpayers get stuck with a hefty bill. How hefty? That’s what we’ve been trying to find out.As you know JW has kept close watch on the First Family’s extravagant personal trips for the American people since we’re the ones footing the bill. And last week we released records detailing the government funds expended on Malia’s March 2012 Spring Break vacation to Mexico. According to the records obtained from the U.S. Secret Service as a result of a Judicial Watch Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed on September 20 2012 the total cost of the trip amounted to $115500.87.The following is a breakdown of the costs as detailed in the documents which are available in full here:Ground transportation: $23964.81Lodging: $21682.92Airfare: $47767.34“Vouchers”: $21636.14 (not itemized)Support Charges: $449.66 (travel for one from Mexico City to Oaxaca not itemized)Malia Obama’s Spring Break trip evoked a significant amount of controversy after the Obama White House reportedly ordered the removal of press reports detailing the trip.On March 19 2012 numerous online press outlets reported on Malia Obama’s Mexico trip noting the fact that she was accompanied by 25 U.S. Secret Service Agents and as many as 12 of her friends. However shortly after the press reports surfaced they were quickly removed from the Internet.As reported by Politico:The AFP the Huffington Post and other websites have scrubbed a report about first daughter Malia Obama’s school trip. On Monday the AFP reported that Obama’s daughter was on a school trip along with a number of friends and 25 Secret Service agents. The story was picked up by Yahoo the Huffington Post and the International Business Times as well as UK publications like the Daily Mail and the Telegraph and other overseas publications like The Australian. But on Monday night the story had been removed from those sites.In an update to this story Politico published a statement issued by Kristina Schake Communications Director to the First Lady indicating that the removal of these news stories was “a White House effort:”“From the beginning of the administration the White House has asked news outlets not to report on or photograph the Obama children when they are not with their parents and there is no vital news interest. We have reminded outlets of this request in order to protect the privacy and security of these girls.”The trip reportedly took place shortly after the Texas Department of Public Safety issued a statement advising students on Spring Break “to avoid Mexico.”I think we can all agree that in these economic times with huge public debt and high unemployment spending $115000 in taxpayer funds on a Spring Break trip to Mexico is inappropriate. Is this what Americans are being asked to pay higher taxes for?This is far from the first time the Obamas have taken advantage of the American taxpayer to enjoy expensive vacations.We previously obtained records from the United States Air Force and the United States Secret Service detailing Michelle Obama’s February 2012 President’s Day weekend ski vacation to Aspen Colorado with her two daughters. The records indicate U.S. Secret Service costs including accommodations at the Fasching Haus deluxe condominium and the Inn at Aspen were $48950.38.Judicial Watch also obtained documents from the United States Air Force and the United States Secret Service detailing costs associated with Michelle Obama’s controversial August 2010 vacation to Spain. According to a Judicial Watch analysis the records indicate a total combined cost of at least $467585.Judicial Watch also obtained documents detailing costs of a June 21-27 2011 trip taken by Michelle Obama her family and her staff to South Africa and Botswana. Judicial Watch received mission expense records and passenger manifests for the Africa trip that described costs of $424142 for the flight and crew alone. Other expenses such as off-flight food transportation security etc. were not included.That’s a total of four trips at a cost of almost $1 million. And these are the trips we know about.Rest assured JW will continue to monitor these First Family excursions in a second Obama term. I suspect they will continue.,1
586,"Near the end of the 2012 election campaign President Obama accused Mitt Romney of “at least Stage 3 Romnesia”-- which the President described as “If you can't seem to remember the policies on your website or the promises you've been making over the six years you've been running for president if you can't even remember what you said last week don't worry.”Well Mr. President look in the mirror for the faults in yourself that you attributed to Mr. Romney. According to the online Urban Dictionary “Obamanesia” is “A questionable commander in chief's partial or total loss of memory regarding the actual sequences of events in an attempt to not take responsibility for them. It is the opposite of Truman's famous phrase: ‘The Buck Stops Here!’ It is a strategy in politics where the one in power attempts to attribute to another person or group the responsibility for one's own lack of leadership or mistakes. Made famous by Barack Hussein Obama's denial of certain emails regarding the Libya incident 2012; after being caught with his pants down he later tried to pin it on Hillary Clinton.”A partial list of the president’s acts of “Obamanesia” include:ObamaCare. The President’s mother of all health care reforms has turned into the mulligan of all health care reforms. Worrying that ObamaCare will hurt Democrats in the 2014 elections the President keeps amending and delaying it ignoring his constitutional obligation to fully implement and enforce a law he already signed.The more we learn about ObamaCare from sources including the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office the more we learn how it will damage job creation (especially full-time jobs) and business growth cost way more than advertised grant special exemptions (e.g. to Congress) deny us the choices we were promised to keep our health care plans and doctors raise taxes increase our wait time for medical treatments while eroding the quality of care and cause doctors and hospitals to cut back or eliminate services.[pullquote]In a recent Fox News poll of American voters 57 percent said the way ObamaCare is being rolled out is “a joke” 63 percent said the law needs to be changed 71 percent believed ObamaCare will increase their taxes 62 percent believe it will increase the cost of their premiums and 65 percent believe implementing the law will add to the federal deficit. Gallup and Rasmussen Reports polls show similar negativity by American voters concerning ObamaCare’s future impact on their families and the country.But in his August 17 radio address the President continued to blame Republicans regarding ObamaCare rather than accept personal responsibility for the law’s flaws. He said “A lot of Republicans seem to believe that if they can gum up the works and make this law fail they’ll somehow be sticking it to me. But they’d just be sticking it to you.”(Mis)handling of the economy. In a recent Gallup poll of American adults just 35 percent give the President thumbs up on his leadership regarding the economy. On Townhall.com columnist Katie Pavlich writes “While Obama claims America is ‘back’ 50 million people are on food stamps and 23 million people are unemployed. After claiming the country was on the right track economically Obama proceeded to blame Republicans for ‘distractions’ and ‘phony’ scandals coming out of Washington.”Lack of candor on a range of matters. In an ABC/Washington Post poll (in English and Spanish) of American adults “. . . a vast 74-20 percent see the IRS’ behavior (targeting conservatives) as inappropriate with most feeling that way strongly -- and 56 percent see it as a deliberate attempt to harass conservative organizations not a mere administrative error.” The poll also found that “. . . on the attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi Libya last fall suspicions of a coverup rise to a majority 55 percent. And in this case only a third of Americans are persuaded that the Obama administration is disclosing honestly what it knows about what occurred.”Another poll discovery: “Americans by 54-38 percent say they think the government is doing more to threaten the rights of average Americans than to protect those rights. Americans by 69-29 percent in this poll say they’re concerned that in trying to protect classified information the federal government will improperly intrude on the freedom of the press.”When the President claims that criticisms of him and his policies are partisan and bogus his attitude can be summed up by another Urban Dictionary definition: of “fuhgeddaboudit.”1. Forget about it -- the issue is not worth the time energy mental effort or emotional resources.2. Definitively ""no.""3. The subject is unequivocally excellent; further thought and analysis are unnecessary.Is a president with “Obamanesia” who says “fuhgeddaboudit” serving the best interests of the country? Polls indicate no.",0
587,"Gregory KorteUSA TODAYIRS sorted tax-exempt applications based on names of group%2C not actual political activityWASHINGTON -- An inspector general report into the Internal Revenue Service's heightened scrutiny of Tea Party groups blames ""ineffective management"" at the agency but does not address whether the policy was politically motivated.The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration's report released Tuesday was an audit -- not an investigative report. It made recommendations about how tax-exempt applications should be processed in the future. It did not blame specific employees or suggest disciplinary action.The report found the IRS office in Cincinnati which processes all applications for tax-exempt status singled out ""Tea Party"" ""Patriot"" and ""9/12"" groups based solely on their names. The applications were singled out for further review of whether they were involved in political campaign activity. The groups were applying for tax exempt status reserved for groups that conduct ""social welfare"" activities as the bulk of their work.The IRS's special treatment of Tea Party applications led to long processing delays the inspector general said. For 13 months beginning in October 2010 the Cincinnati office stopped working on potential political cases entirely.The report said 170 groups received IRS letters asking for additional information and in 98 of those cases the questions asked were later determined to be inappropriate or unnecessary. Those questions included the names of donors the political affiliation of officers and their employment outside the organization.In a response to the draft report the IRS defended its decision to separate out groups involved in potential political activities. ""While centralization was warranted the manner in which we initially designated cases for centralization was inappropriate"" wrote Joseph H. Grant the acting commissioner for tax exempt and government entities.He also said determining which groups are engaged in prohibited political activity is difficult: ""There are no bright line tests for what constitutes political campaign intervention ... or whether an organization is primarily engaged in social welfare activities"" Grant said.Follow @gregorykorte on Twitter.",1
588,Two Congressmen are asking the Treasury Department if it inappropriately scrutinized conservative-owned businesses the same way it targeted Tea Party groups filing for tax-exempt status.Republicans Mike Kelly (PA-03) and Jim Renacci (OH-16) circulated a letter Thursday requesting Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to release documents detailing the process and methodology the Automotive Task Force used to shut down General Motors dealerships in 2009 during the automotive industry crisis.Renacci’s Northeast Ohio Chevrolet dealership was closed in 2010 after losing a battle with General Motors. Congress loaned General Motors $50 billion in 2009 after GM declared bankruptcy which resulted in the federal government owning a majority share of the company. Roughly 2000 dealerships received “wind-down” agreements and while hundreds were able to survive an exhaustive arbitration process Renacci-Doraty Chevrolet in Wadsworth did not. Renacci then a Congressional candidate challenging incumbent John Boccieri placed the blame squarely on President Obama.Mike Kelly has a similar story. He decided to run for Congress when it was announced that Obama’s Automotive Task Force slated Wayland Chevrolet in Butler Pennsylvania for closure. The dealership was started by Kelly’s father in 1953.Now that it has been confirmed that the Treasury Department unfairly profiled conservatives around that time the Congressmen are wondering if that could have been a factor in the selection of certain dealerships for closure.The IRS scandal “raises serious questions about past decisions made by the [Treasury] Department regarding auto dealership closures that occurred in 2008 and 2009” reads the letter. “We formally request that the Treasury Department provide all e-mails phone records notes memoranda reports and other communications regarding the decision-making process for dealership closures from the Automotive Task Force headed by Car Czars Steve Rattner and Ron Bloom.”The letter also notes that while the Automotive Task Force claimed to have objectively evaluated each dealership a Special Inspector General Report found that there was “little or no documentation” that proves objective criteria were used.Full letter here:20130516193224962 –,1
589,next Image 1 of 2prev Image 2 of 2Saturday August 10 marks the third month of the IRS scandal.On May10 when Lois Lerner the former Director of the IRS Exempt Organizations Division answered a question at a legal conference – a question she arranged to have asked in advance -- she clearly had no idea what would happen next.When she admitted that the IRS had targeted conservative groups simply because of their political beliefs she touched off a national firestorm. Her inept attempt to apologize for the Agency’s blunder and put it to rest backfired.In the past three months we have learned that the Obama administration repeatedly tried to downplay this unlawful targeting scheme which is an unprecedented breach of the public’s trust by the IRS.[pullquote]We also know that the scandal continues to expand. And we know that the Obama administration is doing very little to get to the bottom of what happened despite the president's promise to the American people that the administration would “hold the responsible parties accountable.”Today after all this time it’s clear that the Obama administration isn't really interested in the facts about how this could happen at the IRS or about holding anyone accountable.In fact President Obama has moved on calling the IRS targeting scheme a “phony” scandal and acting as if corrective action has been taken and problem solved.Not so fast.From the beginning the facts did not square with the excuses offered up to the American public by the Obama administration.It did not take long to punch holes in the IRS’ story that the scheme to target conservatives began in a small office run by just a couple of rogue agents.In our lawsuit against the IRS on behalf of 41 conservative organizations in 22 states the evidence is very clear: documents have revealed that IRS offices coast-to-coast were involved in the scheme including Lois Lerner herself! In fact she sent more than a dozen letters to conservative organizations asking them intrusive and inappropriate questions.The White House has also claimed that the unconstitutional targeting of conservative organizations ended in May 2012. Again our documents clearly show that the IRS abuse continued through May of 2013 with the most recent letter dated May 6 2013 – just four days before Lerner's admission.And we now know thanks to the testimony of former IRS attorneys that the office of the IRS Chief Counsel (a political presidential appointee) was involved in the scheme too. This testimony raises important questions about President Obama’s knowledge or involvement in the scheme.Now there’s new information to suggest that the IRS may have been providing taxpayer information to the Federal Election Commission something that violates federal law and the IRS's own regulations.An FEC commissioner says he has seen previously undisclosed emails between the IRS and FEC about the targeting scheme. And lawmakers are now demanding the FEC turn over records of more than five years of communications with the IRS.All of this information comes as the Obama administration continues to stonewall Congress about the scandal -- providing just a fraction of the information requested.Noting the three month mark since the scandal began Reps. Darrell Issa (Calif.) and Dave Camp (Mich.) chairmen of the House committees on Oversight and Ways and Means have voiced their concern saying in a statement “The American people demand and deserve accountability from their government not to live in fear of being subject to an audit or other extra scrutiny for reasons unrelated to the content of their filing. So far the IRS and this administration have provided no assurances that oversight and accountability is in place to prevent such abuses from happening again.”The president did order the new Acting IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel to conduct a 30-day review of the IRS scandal. Yes you read that right just a 30-day review to investigate a scheme that had been underway for years. It’s no surprise that Werfel claims the 30-day review turned up no “evidence of intentional wrongdoing by anyone in the IRS.”It’s been 3 months since the American public learned about this outrageous behavior by the IRS. No one has been fired. Lerner and a handful of others are on leave and still being paid.And what has happened to the investigations underway by the FBI and Department of Justice? Three months later not one of our clients has been contacted by investigators at the FBI or Justice Department.It’s difficult to imagine how anyone could claim that a thorough investigation -- or any investigation for that matter – has been conducted without even bothering to interview the taxpayers who were targeted.So the IRS scandal continues. It’s been three months and counting. The last three months have produced many more questions and very few answers.Where’s the accountability Mr. President?,1

592,Losing a hard-fought battle confers no dishonor but losing a badly chosen battle is embarrassing.And then there’s ridiculous.Into the last category goes the decision to close the nation’s monuments to make sure that the government shutdown strikes the hearts of all The American People whose constant invocation by pandering politicians fills one with self-loathing. (Who wants to be an “American People” given the quality of our spokesfolksen?)Then again ridiculous is perhaps too generous a word. Closing the monuments especially the World War II Memorial can be reduced fittingly to a single syllable: Dumb. It is fitting because the seated patron of the Mall Abraham Lincoln was famously monosyllabic. In trivia you can use more than 70 percent of the words in the Gettysburg Address are of one syllable.In more recent history when a group of World War II veterans recently faced barriers blocking entry to the memorial — an open space requiring not so much as an attendant — these elderly warriors took a page from their Normandy playbook and stormed the barricades.1 of 25 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × The Right’s 25 most influential from Townhall.com View Photos The conservative Web site’s latest listing of the most prominent voices on the right with a few names you may not know.

Shutting out veterans from their memorial touchstone was more than a bad call a lapse of judgment a mere moment of tone-deafness. In reality it may have been the tidy effort of a box-checking bureaucrat but it reeked of the small work of a petty bully.Ditto the closing of the D-Day cemetery in Normandy France where more than 9000 Americans are buried. And this is the president who recently declared that The American People are not political pawns to be used to score political points?Barack Obama must have been an inkling in the prescient mind of H.L. Mencken when the curmudgeon from whom all op-eds flow once described democracy as “the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard.”While one may sympathize with Obama’s contempt for his congressional adversaries he may have cut off his own nose with an unforced error of magnified proportions. Spite is unbecoming a president as Richard Nixon proved in another era of national disruption. But beyond personality it is baffling to imagine anyone thinking that the way to winning hearts and minds is by disrespecting the nation’s most beloved demographic.I’ve often lamented the prospect of a world without my parents’ generation not because they were perfect but because these mothers and fathers take with them a national treasure — their personal experiences and memories of the Great Depression and World War II and the lessons of sacrifice thrift courage and duty that defined them.In their place we have a bickering twittering snarling snarky toxic public square that has contaminated even our highest offices. How surreal it must seem to our oldest and wisest citizens to witness the breaking bad of America.Nearly any but the die-hardest tea party member regrets the shuttering of the U.S. government. It was unnecessary counterproductive and punishes all the wrong people — including federal employees who do yeoman’s work for which they receive little credit.Tying the defunding of Obamacare to the shutdown was folly which sensible House Republicans knew even as they ignored their better judgment. Even so the White House and Democrats seem determined to prove their own toughness by punishing the least deserving.As we approach the next battle over the debt ceiling would that all of Washington remember the rule of the savvy negotiator: Always leave your opponent an exit.Read more from Kathleen Parker’s archive follow her on Twitter or find her on Facebook.,1
593,WASHINGTON — A top IRS official in the division that reviews nonprofit groups will invoke the 5th Amendment and refuse to answer questions before a House committee investigating the agency’s improper screening of conservative nonprofit groups.Lois Lerner the head of the exempt organizations division of the IRS won’t answer questions about what she knew about the improper screening — or why she didn’t disclose it to Congress according to a letter from her defense lawyer William W. Taylor III. Lerner was scheduled to appear before the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday.Advertisement“She has not committed any crime or made any misrepresentation but under the circumstances she has no choice but to take this course” said a letter by Taylor to committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Vista).

He told WCBS that he wants a chance to tell the public ""here's what I can do."" For the past few years Spitzer has worked as a political commentator on TV and has taught at City College of New York.The self-described ""steamroller"" who once cracked down on Wall Street became the first New York governor since the 1970s to step down.

595,WASHINGTON – The acting head of the IRS insisted Friday that he and other agency officials did not mislead Congress by failing to disclose that applications by conservative groups for tax-exempt status were mishandled and he said to call it “targeting” incorrectly implied political motivations.Members of the House Ways and Means Committee grilled Steven Miller who has resigned as acting commissioner but is still on the job until Wednesday why he made no mention of the problems in letters and testimony to Congress despite being aware of the issue.Advertisement“How can we conclude that you did not mislead this committee?” asked a visibly agitated Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.)PHOTOS: President Obama’s rough week“I did not mislead the committee” Miller said. “I stand by my answer then. I stand by my answer now.”AdvertisementMiller said the queries from lawmakers in 2012 asked if the IRS was “targeting” conservative groups for intensive questioning and prolonged delays in their applications for 501(c)4 nonprofit status.“When you talk about targeting it’s a pejorative term” Miller said. He later said “targeting” was a “loaded term” ascribing partisan motives to what he said was a flawed work process.Advertisement“I can say generally we provided horrible customer service here” Miller later said. “I will admit that. We did horrible customer service. … Whether it was politically motivated or not is a very different question.”The agency did not publicly disclose the problem until May 10 when Lois Lerner director of the IRS’ exempt organizations division apologized at a tax law conference an unorthodox venue for such an admission.AdvertisementDOCUMENT: The Inspector General’s report on the IRSJust two days earlier Lerner had testified in front of a Ways and Means subcommittee and made no mention of the issue.AdvertisementLerner was asked by Celia Roady a member of the agency’s advisory board for tax-exempt entities how the agency was dealing with applications from 501(c)4 groups.Miller said Friday that the question was anticipated and Lerner’s answer was prepared in advance.AdvertisementFollow Politics Now on Twitter and Facebookmelanie.mason@latimes.comAdvertisementTwitter: @melmason,1

Though he and his brother were charged with stealing a car in the 1970s prosecutors later dropped charges and Issa said he was a victim in the incident according to a New Yorker profile of Issa from 2011. After a suspicious fire at his business’s factory the company’s former owner said he suspected Issa set the fire for insurance but a cause of the fire was never determined and no charges were filed according to the profile.House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-CA) claimed on Sunday that political officials in the Obama administration directed Internal Revenue Service (IRS) agents in Cincinnati to target conservative groups applying for 501 (c)(4) status but his charge fell apart when probed by CNN host Candy Crowley.CROWLEY: The investigator said “So is it your perspective that ultimately the responsible parties for the decisions reported by the [Inspector General] that is the decision that target tea party and patriot applications are not in the Cincinnati office?The employee says ‘I don’t know how to answer that question. I mean from an agent standpoint we didn’t do anything wrong. We followed directions based on other people telling us what to do.’Investigator ‘And you ultimately followed directions from Washington is that correct?The employee ‘if direction had come down from Washington yes.’The investigator ‘But with respect to the particular scrutiny that was given to tea party applications those directions emanated from Washington is that right?’The employee answers ‘I believe so.’ It’s totally not definitive. ISSA: This one isn’t. But I will tell you one of the agents asked for and got a transfer because that person was so uncomfortable that they wanted out of it.It's kind of a cheap shot but certainly no worse than Issa calling Jay Carney a ' paid liar'  and at least some people will know what kind of person is leading GOP 'investigations"" into Democratic ""scandals"".

600,At a time when Congress can’t pass a budget and the president can’t win approval of any important legislation the public is indignant about the threat of an overreaching all-powerful federal government that uses the IRS and the Justice Department to harass its enemies.President Obama hasn’t begun to fix the big problem of Washington dysfunction but he moved Wednesday to respond to public anger and reposition his sinking administration. He fired the acting IRS commissioner released a blizzard of e-mails on Benghazi and backed a shield law to protect journalists. It was fancy footwork in public-relations terms but not a reaction to what’s really ailing the federal government.The crippling problem in Washington these days isn’t any organized conspiracy against conservatives journalists or anyone else. Rather it’s a federal establishment that’s increasingly paralyzed because of poor management and political second-guessing.What should frighten the public is not the federal government’s monstrous power but its impotence.Firing officials has its place in bringing accountability. What’s really needed as these latest episodes show is adult supervision of the bureaucracy. This requires senior officials who are properly sensitive to political issues. But such officials have become so afraid of seeming to meddle that mistakes happen.1 of 68 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Obama View Photos A collection of cartoons of the president. Caption A collection of cartoons of the president. Wait 1 second to continue.Where was the senior manager who should have stopped IRS employees from writing outrageous questionnaires and search queries targeting “Patriots” and “We the People”? Perhaps that person was wading through congressional messages urging IRS investigations of tax-exempt political groups.Where was the top Justice Department official who should have checked a runaway prosecutor from issuing an over-broad subpoena to the Associated Press? The attorney general recused himself because of fear of a perceived conflict of interest. Perhaps lower-level officials were chilled by congressional demands for leak investigations — and insinuations the administration was itself the guilty party.The principal activity of the federal government these days is investigating itself. No panel is bipartisan and independent enough to escape the charge that it is covering something up. This accusation has been leveled against the review panel on Benghazi headed by Tom Pickering former undersecretary of state and Adm. Mike Mullen former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Good grief if these two are part of a conspiracy I’m moving to Moscow.If you unpack the various scandals swirling around Washington this week you find a common theme of bad decisions by government officials compounded by finger-pointing and second-guessing from Congress. Here are some moments in this chain of error.● The IRS investigations of tea party-related conservative groups that began in March 2010 came a couple of months after the Supreme Court in Citizens United opened the way for corporate contributions to political causes. Garance Franke-Ruta in her blog for the Atlantic has identified congressional pressure on the IRS to investigate conservative tax-exempt groups. The unit that was supposed to make such determinations (located in Cincinnati in part to keep it away from political pressure) made an intolerable mistake in searching for right-wing groups using political terms.But the dragnet was hardly a secret: News reports appeared in 2012 about tea party complaints of harassment at a time when some congressional Democrats were demanding that the IRS crack down harder. A grand jury can help unravel whether the IRS’s outrageous decisions amounted to criminal behavior.● The Justice Department launched two special investigations of leaks in June after intense Republican criticism of intelligence disclosures. The probes focused on the sources for stories discussing the Stuxnet cyberattacks on Iran and a spy inside al-Qaeda’s Yemen affiliate.Ann Telnaes animation: Eric Holder gets stuck. (Ann Telnaes/The Washington Post)Even a journalist can understand why officials get upset when such secrets are blown. But the GOP’s larger motivation was its suspicion (apparently wrong) that senior Obama administration officials had organized the leaks. The administration’s own leak obsession (fueled by fears of congressional criticism) led Justice Department officials to subpoena two months of records for more than 20 phones at the AP.Why did Justice approve such a broad seizure when its own guidelines urge narrow use of reporters’ records? Perhaps it was an especially egregious leak jeopardizing a British agent in place and infuriating the United States’ closest ally. We don’t know because the administration has never properly explained its campaign against leaks — fearing political backlash.● Finally Benghazi the scandal that keeps on giving: This one began in the fog of war so it’s best to be cautious about assigning responsibility. But the administration did try from the beginning to spin the story to preserve its campaign theme that Obama had won the war on terror and the GOP has been spinning it ever since to the point that the blame game is beginning to chill operations in North Africa.Another generation would have said: Let’s get on with it. We say let’s have another investigation.Read more from David Ignatius’s archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.,1
601,"For the first time in years the IRS was knocked down a peg or two.In a hearing that escalated into a boisterous public shaming of one of the country's most-feared government agencies lawmakers took turns Friday calling outgoing IRS Commissioner Steven Miller on the carpet for his department's scandalous practice of targeting conservative groups.Miller rebuffed attempts to extract the names of those responsible saying he did not know. But lawmakers vowed that the tense hearing would mark only the start of a series of investigations in which criminal activity could be probed.Rep. Mike Kelly R-Pa. seemed to capture the angst against the agency toward the end of the hours-long hearing as he described the ways its agents are capable of ruining lives.""You can put anybody out of business that you want. ... When the IRS comes in there you're not allowed to be shoddy"" he said suggesting the agency's leadership was being held to a different standard now that it is coming under scrutiny.""This is absolutely an overreach and this is an outrage for all Americans"" he said.When he finished the committee room erupted in cheers and applause that lasted several seconds.The hearing though was more than just venting.While Democrats voiced concern that the latest scandal would be used to score ""political points"" lawmakers on both sides of the aisle scolded the agency. And they made clear they'd be pressuring the IRS in the weeks to come on several points -- namely who was responsible and whether lawmakers were overtly lied to last year.On the first question they got few answers from Miller during Friday's testimony.But they repeatedly confronted the acting commissioner -- who was ousted from him job earlier this week -- about his and other officials' failure to disclose the program last year despite being aware of it.""In fact we were repeatedly told no such targeting was happening. That isn't being misled that's lying"" said Rep. Dave Camp R-Mich. the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.Miller seemed to frustrate lawmakers' attempts to dig deeper. He claimed a week after the scandal broke and a year after he first learned of the practice that he still did not know who was responsible.""I don't have that name"" he testified after Rep. Dave Reichert R-Wash. asked who was behind the program.Miller also claimed -- over and over -- he was being honest with Congress during a hearing last year.""You did not share the information you knew"" Reichert charged.""I answered all questions truthfully"" Miller replied.This claim was met with deep skepticism Friday. Miller acknowledged he learned of the practice during a May 3 2012 briefing. Yet when he was asked about it at a July 25 hearing that year he said only that some applications fell into a particular category -- and that those organizations were grouped for ""consistency"" and ""quality.""A letter he wrote to a Republican lawmaker the month before also gave a general description of the process without acknowledging that some groups were being singled out based on words like ""Tea Party"" and ""Patriot.""""How can we not conclude that you misled this committee?"" Rep. Paul Ryan R-Wis. former GOP vice presidential nominee asked Miller.Miller said he ""did not mislead the committee"" and stands by his answer.Asked whether his answer was ""incomplete"" he said again he answered ""truthfully.""Miller objected to the term ""targeting"" and claimed political motivations were not at play in the program which began in 2010. But he apologized for the program and said ""foolish mistakes were made by people trying to be more efficient.""""As acting commissioner I want to apologize on the behalf of the Internal Revenue Service for the mistakes that we made and the poor service provided"" Miller said. ""The affected organizations and the American public deserve better.""The hearing is the first to examine the scandal and will likely kick off a string of subsequent hearings and investigations. Republicans made clear that the two retirements or resignations to date would not satisfy their concerns.Camp ripped the tax-collecting agency over the practice at the start of the hearing. ""Now we know the truth -- or at least some of it"" he said. ""We also know that these revelations are just the tip of the iceberg. It would be a mistake to treat this as just one scandal.""He questioned how high the scandal went and also suggested there was other targeting of conservatives that has not yet been acknowledged by the agency. He called it part of a ""culture of cover-ups.""""This systemic abuse cannot be fixed with just one resignation or two"" he said. He said the problem is not just personnel but the size and scope of the IRS.The inspector general who released a scathing report on the agency also testified Friday. J. Russell George -- the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration -- said his findings raised ""troubling questions"" about the agency while claiming some of the wrongdoing was apparently done with no-to-little supervision.But he said all three allegations against the agency turned out to be true -- that it was using ""inappropriate criteria"" to screen conservative groups it was delaying applications and it was asking unnecessary questions.Rep. Sander Levin D-Mich. the top Democrat on the committee said the agency's management ""completely failed the American people."" At the same time he urged Republicans not to use the hearing to ""score political points.""Republicans though expressed more concern after they learned Thursday that the IRS official who led the tax-exempt organizations unit when the targeting took place -- Sarah Hall Ingram -- has since moved over to the IRS office responsible for ObamaCare.Miller said Friday he was the one who promoted her and called her a ""superb civil servant.""The acknowledgement comes after the administration announced that Ingram's successor Joseph Grant -- who had only been on the job a few days -- would be retiring.President Obama meanwhile maintained Thursday that he didn't know about the investigation into the IRS program until it was made public. Obama also appointed a new acting commissioner -- White House budget officer Daniel Werfel -- after the prior IRS chief announced his resignation.",1
602,"No California business for you!The rivalry between Texas and California is no secret and it goes far beyond the fact that they are the two most populous states in the nation. While neither state is monolithic in terms of its political ideology—Texas has deep-blue Austin while some inland parts of California are a startling shade of crimson—the politics of each state has been marked by radically different ideologies. California's main power bases of economic and political power include two of the places conservatives most love to hate: San Francisco and Hollywood. Meanwhile every single statewide elected official is a Democrat and Democrats have dominated the state legislature despite the roadblocks along the way. In recent years the state government has sought to invest in projects like high-speed rail and solar energy often taxing itself for the privilege Texas of course is just the opposite: a conservative ideological paradise funded substantially by the oil industry with low taxes and a belief that government is the problem not the solution.Because of its ideological ramifications the rivalry between Texas and California is more than just competition for bragging rights between the nations two heaviest hitters; rather it is ground zero in an ideological proxy war between the progressive and conservative factions of larger-scale national politics. And in recent years as the Lone Star State was experiencing its so-called ""Texas Miracle"" while California was limping along from budget crisis to budget crisis it was far from uncommon for conservative ideologues to point to the contrast between the two as evidence of the success of conservative economic policy.Unfortunately for them the tide has turned on this view. First the so-called Texas Miracle turned out to be a sham masked by a combination of rapid population growth high oil prices and low wages. Ironically enough it was billions of dollars in stimulus funds that was propping up Texas' budget solvency. When that ran out and the economic crisis finally showed its full effects the state faced a crippling budget deficit of $27 billion and was forced to make massive cuts to Medicaid and education to stay afloat.California meanwhile has been on exactly the opposite trajectory. The voters sick of the tax revolt that had been artificially maintained by the Republican minority voted in a series of structural reforms that loosened the minority's stranglehold in Sacramento and followed that up by passing two tax measures to promote green energy and protect our schools from further cuts. Combined with the economic recovery that has been taking place nationwide these changes were enough to put California's budget back in the black for the first time in many years even as Texas suffers from high poverty low wages and a drastically failing education system.Join me below the fold to learn more about why the economic miracle in Texas was really a mirage.",0
603,Story highlights Jon Stewart expressed frustration of Obama supporters over IRS scandal Obama has not delivered on promises to change Washington says Julian Zelizer He says Obama like other reform-minded presidents chose to work within the system Zelizer: Some scandals have prodded politicians to push for transformative changeEditor’s Note: Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. He is the author of “Jimmy Carter” and “Governing America.”(CNN) —On “The Daily Show” Jon Stewart captured the frustration that many of President Obama’s supporters have felt over the past week as one scandal after another cascaded into the White House.After starting with a predictable riff accusing Bill O’Reilly of ignoring facts when attacking the Obama administration Stewart turned to the IRS story banged on his desk and yelled out curses.Stewart then blasted the administration for the revelation that the IRS had given extra scrutiny to right-wing organizations. “Explanation please” Stewart said before playing some comedic clips of Lois Lerner the official in charge of handling tax-exempt organizations at the IRS who admits she is not good at math.“Well congratulations President Barack Obama” Stewart went on to say. “Conspiracy theorists who generally can survive in anaerobic environments have just had an algae bloom dropped on their f*****g heads. Thus removing the last arrow in your pro-governance quiver. … This has in one seismic moment shifted the burden of proof from the tinfoil-behatted to the government.”Opinion: Will scandals stall Obama agenda?Larry Levanti Julian ZelizerThis was just one of the scandals to rock the administration within the week. The media also reported that the Justice Department had conducted a surveillance operation focusing on journalists for The Associated Press in an effort to find the source behind a leaked story about a foiled terrorist attack.Many liberal Democrats were frustrated and shocked that the administration had permitted the seizure of the phone records the kind of activities they would certainly have railed against had they happened under President George W. Bush.Although there is no evidence that Obama was involved in either of these incidents – and many Republicans are clearly trying to use them to drum up a narrative about a scandal-ridden presidency – the combination left many Democrats like Stewart scratching their heads wondering what happened to the president who promised when he ran in 2008 to transform the way politics worked.Despite controversies Obama approval rating holds steadyIt is still too early to know all the facts and what the president’s role has been. Nonetheless some of the frustration that Obama’s supporters feel comes from ways in which this White House has too often accepted politics as usual rather than embarking on the transformative changes that he once promised. While many of the president’s supporters insist that he has delivered on his promise to push forward a bold policy agenda few would say that he has fulfilled his goal of changing the way that politics works.What happened?Since the resignation of President Richard Nixon over Watergate most presidential candidates have run on the promise to fix a broken Washington. Jimmy Carter whose 1976 campaign revolved around the basic promise that you could trust him perfected this message and style of campaigning.In one way or another every candidate – including Obama’s predecessor Bush – has assured voters he would reform government and transform politics. But the change doesn’t happen. Within four years as Carter discovered the new boss looks like the old boss and “the system” seems the same.Most presidents realize once they are in office that reforming Washington will consume too much of their political capital generating more enemies among their opponents as well as within their own party and the results of any such initiative will probably be negligible.Instead once in office presidents tend to embrace the role of politician and turn their attention to bread-and-butter issues that will matter much more to voters on Election Day. The easiest way to achieve policy goals is by working through the existing system rather than trying to remake things.Transformation is also difficult simply because the size and scale of the executive branch have grown so much over the past century vastly increasing the odds that things can go wrong.Within each agency there are multiple opportunities for unethical bureaucrats sometimes without presidential knowledge to do bad things. This is part of the reason there have been such strong advocates on the right and the left calling for greater – though less politicized – congressional oversight and tighter rules to constrain wrongdoing.Opinion: For Obama it’s no more Mr. Nice MediaIn certain respects the burden as Stewart points out is greater for liberals given the centrality of government to their agenda. Over the past decades the vast expansion of executive power through the homeland security program has also increased the possibilities for wrongdoing.People should not be surprised that the Justice Department was so aggressive with the AP phone records. After all Obama has kept most of Bush’s homeland security program in place and has conducted an extraordinarily aggressive program to contain any leaks that threaten the system. In defense of the government’s actions Attorney General Eric Holder said the leak that it was investigating “put the American people at risk.”Reforming government has also fallen victim to the hyperpartisan polarization that defines Washington. From day one in the White House Obama has faced an incredibly hostile Republican Party unwilling to support almost anything he does. This vastly diminished the incentives for him to try to find bipartisan support for reform initiatives which usually generate a lot of opposition from interests who thrive in the status quo and are rarely priorities for voters on Election Day.With campaign finance another area where Obama has greatly disappointed his supporters Obama decided that the only way to beat the Republicans would be to raise and spend as much money as they did. That prompted his decision to turn down federal financing for his campaigns bringing an end to the post-Watergate reforms and leading to reliance on the Super PACs he once criticized.None of this is meant to excuse the kinds of activities that have recently been revealed. But Americans should not be surprised that the promise of reform vanished under Obama and that the problems of government he inherited have not gone away.Obama to new grads: ‘No time for excuses’Ultimately we will need politicians who are willing to take huge risks in tackling some of the underlying problems with government – or a scandal so severe that it creates real political pressure for incumbents to do something – if we are to strengthen our processes and reduce the risks of the kinds of stories we saw this past week.Scandals can prod elected officials to take reform seriously. Following Watergate a scandal far worse than what we have seen thus far Congress and the president adopted a number of major government reforms that included a new campaign finance system ethics rules the Office of the Independent Counsel and much more. While Carter has been criticized for many of his failings on domestic and foreign policy his decision to move forward with reforms in the wake of Watergate stands as one of his biggest achievements.Perhaps Obama should use this moment as an opportunity to be bold and to return to some of the fundamental ideas for reform that he raised in embarking on his journey to the White House.Follow @CNNOpinion on Twitter.Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion.The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.,1

She is a nationally syndicated columnist an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and author of “Cooking with Grease: Stirring the Pot in America.” She was manager for the Gore-Lieberman presidential campaign in 2000.(CNN) —Our democracy is endangered. Not by the Russians North Korea the Iran regime or even terrorists. To quote Pogo: “We have met the enemy and he is us.”Inside the beltway the fingers point and the media tuts and struts in glee and we the American public respond by becoming more rigid and divided ourselves. No more “truth springing from argument amongst friends” as David Hume said. A recent nonpartisan Pew Research Poll finds our knee-jerk partisanship has increased dramatically.This road we’re on will lead us step-by-step to an extreme: either an autocratic government that functions or a dysfunctional anarchy. The petty squabbles bilge in the name of party or principle will dissolve our self-government.JUSTIN LAROSE/cnnAbraham Lincoln felt no foreign power could ever defeat the United States. He said “From whence shall we expect the approach of danger? Shall some trans-Atlantic military giant step the earth and crush us at a blow? Never…No if destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of free men we will live forever or die by suicide.”We’re pointing a pistol at our heads. A government of by and for the people requires that people talk to people that we can agree to disagree but do so in civility. If we let the politicians and those who report dictate our discourse then our course will be dictated.Why am I alarmed? Because two “scandals” – the IRS tax-exempt inquiries and the Department of Justice’s tapping of reporters’ phones – have become lynch parties. And the congressional investigation of Benghazi may become a scandal in itself.The IRS scandal has sparked bipartisan outrage that should require a bipartisan solution. The director who oversaw this was a Bush appointee who was confirmed by a Democratic Congress. Even Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein says he doubts very much that Obama was involvedWe the people need to stay focused on facts causes and solutions. Let’s begin with the findings of the Treasury’s inspector general who uncovered it: That it was bureaucratic mismanagement but that there was no evidence of any political motivation or influence from outside the IRS.And that according to acting Commissioner Steven Miller who just resigned the problem started because the Supreme Court’s Citizens’ United decision created a surge of requests by political groups for tax-exempt status.Democrats and Republicans agree there’s a problem. Maybe they should focus on solutions.Let’s demand an end to partisan sideshows or media witch hunts: It turns out that the leaked White House Benghazi e-mails which allegedly show a coverup of a terrorist attack were themselves altered. Those e-mails are in a word bogusNext up on the playbill: The Department of Justice secretly obtained dozens of reporters’ phone records because of a serious security leak. The double contradictory shell game we’re supposed to believe: Obama is not in charge and he has his finger in every pot.This bamboozling of the American people obscures the main point: How do we safeguard American lives and respect our freedoms at the same time? Maybe working together – Republicans and Democrats conservatives and liberals – the Media Shield Law a solution to the problem can be passed.Both the Democrats and Republicans have run roughshod over our separation of powers. Both parties have misused and abused their constitutional powers. Democrats blocked again and again President Bush’s nominees for federal judges. Today Republicans aren’t just blocking Obama’s judicial nominees they’re blocking the Senate from considering laws and blocking Cabinet appointees necessary for the federal government to run.Why should we allow any political party or personality to render our government unable to govern?On 9/11 terrorists attacked the World Trade Center the Pentagon and tried to attack the U.S. Capitol building in order to destroy our institutions our economic strength our military and our democratic Congress where “the people rule.”But in our partisan self-righteousness we’re destroying our foundations of government more effectively than al Qaeda ever could. Whether it’s the media or the politicians the churning of partisan passion into anger indeed hate has an ulterior purpose: If Obama’s administration is constantly engaged in fighting for its existence the governing comes to a halt and his agenda will go nowhere.Aiming for that and little if nothing else weakens and harms our democratic institutions both Congress and the presidency. Remember Obama was elected by a bigger margin than George W. Bush. He deserves to have his appointees and he deserves to have votes on the issues to have the government function and to fight for the policies on which he was elected. By allowing problems to become scandals and scandals to become demagoguery we’re shooting ourselves in the foot.If it keeps up we will all be complicit in weakening our democracy.Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Donna Brazile.",1
605,And efforts to insulate the foundation from potential conflicts have highlighted just how difficult it can be to disentangle the Clintons’ charity work from Mr. Clinton’s moneymaking ventures and Mrs. Clinton’s political future according to interviews with more than two dozen former and current foundation employees donors and advisers to the family. Nearly all of them declined to speak for attribution citing their unwillingness to alienate the Clinton family.Powered by CelebrityLast Thursday Mr. Clinton arrived two hours late to an exuberant welcome at a health clinic about 60 miles north of Johannesburg. Children in zebra-striped loincloths sang as Mr. Clinton and Ms. Clinton made their entrance and the former president enthusiastically explained how his foundation had helped the South African government negotiate large reductions in the price of drugs that halt the progress of HIV. Aaron Motsoaledi South Africa’s minister of health heaped praise on the effort. “Because of your help we are able to treat three and a half times more people than we used to” he told the crowd.The project is typical of the model pioneered by the Clinton Foundation built around dozens of partnerships with private companies governments or other nonprofit groups. Instead of handing out grants the foundation recruits donors and advises them on how best to deploy their money or resources from helping Procter & Gamble donate advanced water-purification packets to developing countries to working with credit card companies to expand the volume of low-cost loans offered to poor inner city residents.The foundation which has 350 employees in 180 countries remains largely powered by Mr. Clinton’s global celebrity and his ability to connect corporate executives A-listers and government officials. On this month’s Africa trip Mr. Clinton was accompanied by the actors Dakota Fanning and Jesse Eisenberg and the son of the New York City mayoral candidate John A. Catsimatidis a longtime donor.For most of the foundation’s existence its leadership has been dominated by loyal veterans of the Clintons’ political lives. Ira C. Magaziner who was a Rhodes scholar with Mr. Clinton and ran Mrs. Clinton’s failed attempt at a health care overhaul in the 1990s is widely credited as the driving force behind the foundation’s largest project the Clinton Health Access Initiative which among other efforts negotiates bulk purchasing agreements and price discounts on lifesaving medicines.Mr. Band who arrived at the White House in 1995 and worked his way up to become Mr. Clinton’s closest personal aide standing behind the president on golf courses and the global stage helped build the foundation’s fund-raising structure. He conceived of and for many years helped run the Clinton Global Initiative the annual conference that draws hundreds of business leaders and heads of state to New York City where attendees are pushed to make specific philanthropic commitments.Today big-name companies vie to buy sponsorships at prices of $250000 and up money that has helped subsidize the foundation’s annual operating costs. Last year the foundation and two subsidiaries had revenues of more than $214 million.,1

608,Eight months into President George W. Bush’s second term the Washington Post wrote that Bush’s frequent trips to his Texas ranch symbolized “a lackadaisical approach to the world’s most important day job” and gleefully noted that Bush was intent on setting the record for being on “vacation”–or away from Washington D.C.–for the most number of days of any president.But when President Barack Obama vacations in Hawaii sets up a fantasy golf vacation for himself with Butch Harmon and Tiger Woods averages more than a vacation a month in 2013 while purporting to be a man of the people and demanding the rich pay their fair share and playing sequester politics by shutting down White House tours the mainstream media is silent.And while Bush spent more time outside of Washington than Obama it is also worth nothing that nearly all of Bush’s vacations were trips back to his Texas ranch or family vacation homes in Maine.The Post in 2005 conceded that Bush’s vacations–unlike Obama’s–were not lavish and he did not “make time for fun.”“Bush rarely takes the type of vacation one would consider exotic — or to some even appealing” the Post wrote. “His notion of relaxation is chopping cedar on his ranch or mountain biking through rough terrain all in 100-degree-plus temperatures in dusty Texas where crickets are known to roast on the summer pavement. He seems to relish the idea of exposing aides and reporters to the hothouse environment.”Obama on the other hand has traveled to Hawaii every winter. The Obama daughters are vacationing at the Atlantis Resort in the Bahamas this week with a full Secret Service detail as Breitbart News reported even as the White House claimed they could not afford to pay Secret Service agents to continue the popular White House tours for other students who are on their spring vacations in Washington D.C.The Obamas have gone to Martha’s Vineyard multiple times while the country was in recession and Americans were struggling to find jobs. Michelle Obama has taken a whirlwind trip to Spain and a ski trip to Aspen.Obama took 13 vacations in his first term which spanned all or part of 83 days. But they have been much more lavish than Bush’s. His annual vacations to Hawaii alone have cost taxpayers at least $20 million during his first term. In 2011 alone Michelle Obama may have cost taxpayers $10 million on vacations herself. Obama’s fantasy golf outing this year cost local law enforcement in Florida a reported $78 205.Bush was content to work from home during his vacations. And for doing so the mainstream media tagged him as lazy and disinterested. The Obamas gallivant around making plenty of “time for fun” and the mainstream media does not call them out for wasting taxpayer dollars or even for the terrible “optics.”,1
609,"Former Alaska governor and Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin took to Facebook on Monday to accuse President Barack Obama of toying with ""impeachable offenses"" to address the looming debt ceiling deadline.""Apparently the president thinks he can furlough reality when talking about the debt limit"" Palin wrote.Palin said Obama who has repeatedly warned about the dangers of default if Congress does not raise the debt ceiling ahead of the October 17 deadline is using the debt limit to scare the public.""It’s also shameful to see him scaremongering the markets with his talk of default"" she wrote. ""There is no way we can default if we follow the Constitution.""Palin went on to cite the Constitution's 14th Amendment.""The Fourteenth Amendment Section 4 requires that we service our debt first"" she wrote. ""We currently collect more than enough tax revenue to service our debt if we do that first.""However Palin suggested that Obama could face impeachment if he used the 14th Amendment to raise the debt ceiling without congressional approval — an option endorsed in a Courier-Journal op-ed by constitutional lawyer Brianne Gorod. Former President Bill Clinton and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) have also urged Obama to invoke the 14th Amendment if necessary.Palin on the other hand said any such action would be a ""betrayal"" of future generations.""It’s time for the president to be honest with the American people for a change. Defaulting on our national debt is an impeachable offense and any attempt by President Obama to unilaterally raise the debt limit without Congress is also an impeachable offense"" Palin wrote. ""A default would also be a shameful lack of leadership just as mindlessly increasing our debt without trying to rein in spending is a betrayal of our children and grandchildren who will be stuck with the bill.""",1
610,"In the months leading up to today's vote on California's Proposition 19 to legalize recreational use of marijuana opponents of legalization have issued a barrage of confused and contradictory arguments. Their aim is to somehow debunk the common-sense fact that legal sourcing erodes the black-market profits of organized crime.The most recent argument thrown out in the anti-Prop. 19 campaign claims that the California marijuana market is insignificant to Mexican drug traffickers.That argument was blown out of the water on October 18 when the Mexican Army and police seized 134 tons of marijuana wrapped and ready to be smuggled from Tijuana across the border. The huge cache was estimated to be worth at least $338 million dollars on the street. Mexican authorities guessed that it was owned by the nation's most powerful drug-trafficking organization the Sinaloa Cartel.Even if much of that is distributed to other states the sheer size of the potential shipment shows that the U.S. marijuana market for Mexican traffickers calculated at $20 billion a year is well worth fighting for. Since before Prop. 19 came along reports showed that Mexico's drug cartels were concerned about how U.S. production and legalization of medical marijuana cut into their profits.Prohibition creates the underground market that generates their economic political and military strength. With the drop in income from marijuana sales cartels have less money for buying arms and politicians or recruiting young people into the trade.The drug cartels also consider the marijuana black market worth killing for. Just days after the historic bust thirteen young men were massacred at a drug rehabilitation center. An anonymous voice came over police radio saying the act was ""a taste of Juarez"" and that up to 135 people could be murdered in retaliation for the bust--one per ton.Although calculating Mexican cartel earnings from marijuana sales will always be a guessing game it's indisputable that as long as it's illegal every penny of those earnings goes into the pockets of organized crime. From the peasant who converts his land from corn to pot to feed his family to the truckdriver who takes on a bonus cargo to the Mexican and U.S. border officials who open ""windows"" in international customs controls to the youth gangs who sell in U.S. cities--all are sucked into a highly organized and brutal system of contraband.Legalization in part of the world's leading market would take a huge chunk out of this transnational business.The government of Mexican president Felipe Calderon along with Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos has redoubled efforts in U.S. media and international forums to oppose the California legalization measure. This is not surprising. These two nations are deeply entrenched in a military-model drug war that has channeled a combined total of nearly $9 billion dollars in U.S. government funds to their governments. As in any war powerful political and economic interests are at stake in perpetuating the drug war.It's interesting to see what they say though. Neither President Santos nor Calderon argue that legalization will strengthen drug cartels. Instead both complain that legalization will erode their drug war by heightening the contradiction between violent crackdowns on growers and traffickers in their countries and the lax attitude toward consumption of marijuana in the United States.At a recent meeting of the Tuxtla Dialogue in Cartagena Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos said ""It's confusing for our people to see that while we lose lives and invest resources in the fight against drug trafficking in consuming countries initiatives like California's referendum are being promoted.""It's about time that contradiction was exposed. But the way to resolve it is not to increase fumigation operations that destroy peasant livelihoods and the environment and seizures of marijuana shipments that lead to the deaths of innocent civilians while further criminalizing consumption in the U.S. The way to resolve it is to halt ineffective measures to stop marijuana use and focus scarce resources on attacking the financial and violent aspects of transnational organized crime and providing employment and services for vulnerable sectors. Legalization of marijuana in addition to reducing the economic base of the cartels frees up resources to do just that.In a report from the Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy former presidents of Mexico Colombia Brazil called for discussion on legalizing marijuana noting ""Prohibitionist policies based on the eradication of production and on the disruption of drug flows as well as on the criminalization of consumption have not yielded the expected results. We are farther than ever from the announced goal of eradicating drugs."" They add that corruption and violence have increased throughout the region as result of the strategy.The war on drugs launched by President Felipe Calderon has led to more than 30000 drug-related deaths since late 2006 and the skyrocketing of human rights violations committed by security forces. Last week an international Forum against militarization and violence in Ciudad Juarez the epicenter of the drug war was disrupted when police shot a peace protester.As Calderon insists that there is ""no alternative"" to the militarized drug war a recent survey shows that three-fourths of Mexicans polled believe the drug war is failing. Particularly in border towns grassroots organizations have formed to protest the violence and high social costs. Meanwhile the government has largely bypassed non-violent ways to reduce the power of cartels such as legalization anti-money laundering efforts and social programs to strengthen affected communities in favor of the military/police model supported by the U.S. government.Organized crime is a business. Reducing demand through providing legal sources hurts that business. Hardline rhetoric and wars of statistics cannot change that fundamental equation.",0
611,"The U.S. War on Marijuana is not just costly time-consuming and unnecessary -- it's also racially biased according to a new report.In recent years several states have passed laws that decriminalized marijuana and a majority of Americans now support legalizing the drug. Yet between 2001 and 2010 there were over 8 million pot arrests in the U.S. What's worse the authorities making the arrests were targeting black Americans far more than whites.According to a new study from the American Civil Liberties Union which tracked marijuana arrests by race and county in all 50 states and the District of Columbia black and white Americans use marijuana at about the same rate. However blacks were nearly four times as likely than whites to be arrested on charges of marijuana possession in 2010.In Washington D.C. Iowa Minnesota and Illinois blacks were 7.5 to 8.5 times more likely than whites to be arrested for possessing pot.Most of the people being arrested weren't drug kingpins. Fifty-two percent of all drug arrests in 2010 were for marijuana and according to the ACLU's analysis most of the arrestees were in possession of small amounts of the drug.Having a black president hasn't eased this racial disparity either. During President Barack Obama’s first three years in office the arrest rate for marijuana possession was about 5 percent higher than the average rate under President George W. Bush The New York Times reported.Obama's first term in office was also marked by an economic recession a soaring deficit (due to the cost of the Bush tax cuts and two wars) and numerous budget battles that threatened to cause state and federal government shutdowns. In the midst of this the costs of the War on Marijuana continued to rise.In 2010 states spent an estimated $3.6 billion enforcing marijuana possession laws which was a 30 percent increase from a decade earlier. Such a large amount of funding provides a strong financial incentive for police to make arrests and boost their crime-fighting statistics the ACLU reported. In fact that same year more people were arrested for marijuana possession than for all violent crimes combined.""In the past 75 years we have seen mounting evidence of the benign nature of the marijuana plant and its tremendous potential for medical development"" Amanda Reiman policy manager for the Drug Policy Alliance said in 2012. ""But the rampant misinformation about the effects of marijuana USE is dwarfed by the lifetime of suffering that a marijuana CONVICTION can bring.""Click here to download the full report.",0
612,ARCATA Calif. — It took the death of a small rare member of the weasel family to focus the attention of Northern California’s marijuana growers on the impact that their huge and expanding activities were having on the environment.The animal a Pacific fisher had been poisoned by an anticoagulant in rat poisons like d-Con. Since then six other poisoned fishers have been found. Two endangered spotted owls tested positive. Mourad W. Gabriel a scientist at the University of California Davis concluded that the contamination began when marijuana growers in deep forests spread d-Con to protect their plants from wood rats.That news has helped growers acknowledge reluctantly what their antagonists in law enforcement have long maintained: like industrial logging before it the booming business of marijuana is a threat to forests whose looming dark redwoods preside over vibrant ecosystems.Hilltops have been leveled to make room for the crop. Bulldozers start landslides on erosion-prone mountainsides. Road and dam construction clogs some streams with dislodged soil. Others are bled dry by diversions. Little water is left for salmon whose populations have been decimated by logging.,1
613,SEATTLE — When the Justice Department announced Thursday that it would not interfere with the enforcement of voter-approved laws that allow recreational pot use in Washington state and Colorado leaders on both sides of the issue had the same thought: The policy will probably encourage other states to consider similar laws.For supporters of the state laws the policy marked a milestone that they believe will boost their efforts to legalize marijuana in other states including Oregon Nevada Massachusetts and Alaska. But for those who have been fighting the legalization of marijuana the announcement increased their concern.Advertisement“The green rush is upon us. The federal government is saying ‘We’re just going to back off’” said a disappointed Derek Franklin president of the Washington Assn. of Substance Abuse and Violence Prevention which had campaigned against the state law.On the other side Alex Cooley co-founder of Solstice said to be the first legal cannabis-growing facility in Washington state called the action a “very large step forward” but that he expected the controversy to continue. “It is not the end of the war on the prohibition of cannabis.”AdvertisementBut conflict between the Colorado and Washington state laws and federal law — which still considers marijuana a Schedule I drug along with cocaine and heroin — had been a source of tension and confusion.Many marijuana advocates said the discord prompted some municipalities to take a wait-and-see approach to enacting zoning and other regulations to permit pot sales not knowing what the federal ramifications would be.Advertisement“I do think it will bring some level of relief or comfort” said Rachel Gillette the Colorado executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. “You can operate without fear the [Drug Enforcement Administration] is going to come seize your property and send you to prison.”But the policy also represents something larger. “It’s a loud statement from the Obama administration that their intent is to let the experiment happen” said John Davis executive director of the Washington state-based Coalition for Cannabis Standards and Ethics.Advertisement“It’s huge” he said. “The fact it mentions adult recreational use is historic.”Franklin whose organization opposes the Washington state law said Thursday’s announcement “really opens the door for other states even wider.” He said not enough has been done to regulate the risk of marijuana abuse. He cautioned against empowering the marijuana industry which he compared to the tobacco and alcohol industries.AdvertisementBut Gillette said this could represent a shift from handling marijuana in punitive ways toward education and rehabilitation.“We’re finally reaching a point where we can look at alternatives to prohibition” she said. “It’s become very very clear that the war on drugs has failed and we need to look at alternative ways to deal with illicit drugs. I’m hoping this will inspire the federal government to treat drug abuse as a health issue rather than throw [abusers] in jail and leave them there.”Advertisementrick.rojas@latimes.com,0

615,"By Mark Felsenthal WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama in an interview broadcast on Sunday blamed conservative Republicans for a stalemate on the budget and insisted that while he is willing to haggle over taxes and government spending he will not make a deal would that would impose conditions on increasing the nation's debt limit. With a possible government shutdown looming in two weeks and the threat of a U.S. debt default as early as mid-October Obama said on ABC's ""This Week with George Stephanopoulos"" that it is up to lawmakers to work out a budget. He insisted the budget should contain enough spending to help support economic growth and said he will not allow Republicans to attach conditions to raising the $16.7 trillion U.S. borrowing cap. ""We've presented our budget"" Obama said. ""Now it's the job of Congress to come up with a budget that keeps our long-term trends of ... reducing the deficit moving forward but also allows us to invest in the things we need to grow."" Obama said trading cuts to his signature healthcare program in exchange for an increase in the nation's borrowing limit is not an option. ""What I haven't been willing to negotiate and will not negotiate is on the debt ceiling"" he said. With the crisis over Syria off the boil Washington faces yet another fiscal showdown. Most government operations will cease on October 1 unless Congress passes a budget the president will accept and the United States risks a debt default as early as mid-October if lawmakers delay raising the borrowing cap. Obama and the Republican-led House of Representatives remain at loggerheads over both the budget and the debt limit. Republican lawmakers have sought to make defunding the president's signature healthcare law the Affordable Care Act also known as Obamacare a condition for raising the cap. Obama's administration has delayed implementing such steps as signing final agreements with insurance plans to be sold on federal health insurance exchanges as it struggled to get the law's provisions in place before enrollment opens on October 1. ""This administration has already delayed or waived fully a third of this legislation and we believe it is only fair for the American people now to have that same delay and that's the proposal I believe will be coming forward this week"" Republican Representative Tom Price of Georgia said on ""Fox News Sunday."" Democratic Representative Chris Van Hollen said on the same program that legislation mandating delays in putting the law in place would stand in the way of making health insurance affordable to many Americans and is ""not acceptable."" ""WAYS OF DOING THIS"" Lawmakers last week considered extending government funding at current $988 billion levels until mid-December but Tea Party Republicans insisted that cuts to Obamacare remain part of the package. Obama will mark the five-year anniversary of the U.S. financial crisis on Monday in an effort to move back to his domestic agenda after weeks of dealing with Syria and how to respond to its use of chemical weapons. The financial crisis was accelerated on September 15 2008 when the Lehman Brothers firm filed for bankruptcy protection. Obama is expected to focus on the positive discussing progress made and highlighting his prescriptions for boosting job creation amid budget battles with Republicans. He said he would be willing to talk to House Speaker John Boehner about reversing deep across-the-board spending cuts that went into effect this year through the process known as sequestration but said Boehner has been an unwilling partner. ""There are ways of doing this. It's just that they haven't been willing to negotiate in a serious way on that"" Obama said. Obama and Boehner have clashed on repeated occasions over the budget. A standoff over raising the debt limit in 2011 resulted in the first-ever U.S. credit rating downgrade and dealt a setback to the nascent economic recovery. Obama also said he is willing to talk to Republicans about how to accelerate further reductions in the budget deficit. But he pointed out that the deficit has shrunk more quickly than expected and said that efforts by ""a portion of Congress"" to push for sharper budget reductions would only worsen the wide gap between rich and poor in the United States. ""There's no serious economist out there that would suggest that if you took the Republican agenda of slashing education further slashing Medicare further slashing research and development further slashing investments in infrastructure further that would reverse some of these trends of inequality"" he said. The Congressional Budget Office has said it expects the government's annual deficit to shrink to $642 billion in the fiscal year that ends this month the first annual deficit below $1 trillion in five years.

616,"USATODAYUnder the Constitution%2C members of Congress can%27t have their own pay cut as part of the %27sequester%27Congressional offices could see an across-the-board budget cut of about 9%25Budget cuts could hit some congressional offices harder than othersWASHINGTON — As the rest of the federal government prepares for furloughs layoffs and sweeping budget cuts caused by the ""sequester"" the people who could prevent the cuts are the ones whose paychecks are protected: members of Congress.The 27th Amendment to the constitution — intended to prevent members of Congress from voting themselves a pay raise — also prohibits them from taking a pay cut until after the next election.Congress will feel the pain in other ways. Members' office budgets committee staff and leadership offices will all see the same across-the-board cuts as any other discretionary  non-defense spending.Other legislative branch functions — the Capitol Visitor Center the Library of Congress's Books for the Blind program even the Capitol Police — would take cuts of about 9% according to a report from the Office of Management and Budget.In the House each representative gets an annual office budget of about $1.5 million — more for members from expensive and faraway districts.Some congressional offices may feel the cuts more deeply than others. A USA TODAY analysis of 2011 congressional spending showed that 40% of House members had spent more than 90% of their office budgets — and Congress has cut its own budgets by about 8% since then. Additional cuts imposed by the sequester could force these offices to lay off staff or implement other cost-cutting strategies.In 2011 Congress passed — and President Obama signed into law — the Budget Control Act which required the across-the-board cuts of $1.2 trillion as a way to motivate lawmakers to find some other way of reducing the nation's budget deficit. They didn't.Much of the $85 billion cost savings this year will come through furloughs the administration has said. As many as 800000 civilian employees in the Defense Department will have to take 22 days of unpaid leave before Oct. 1. Active-duty military and civilian defense employees in combat zones are exempt as are senior political appointees in the Obama administration who don't fall under federal civil service rules.The Executive Office of the President is subject to the sequester but White House spokesman Jay Carney — while warning of the dire effects of agency cuts — declined to elaborate on how the presidency would be impacted. Again the president's salary wouldn't be cut.When Congress passed the sequester Washington Rep. Norman Dicks then the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee warned colleagues that the sequester would mean the elimination of about two legislative aides in a typical congressional office.Rep. Bob Goodlatte R-Va. runs two offices — his member office and the House Judiciary Committee where he's chairman. He said the sequester hasn't come as a surprise — so he doesn't expect that draconian measures will be necessary to come within budget.""We have been taking this into account with our hiring both on the committee and in my congressional office. So I hope to be able to avoid that"" he said. ""Any federal agency that has been listening to what's been going on for the last year and a half since this issue came up I would hope has also taken that into account in their hiring practices so that they can mitigate the effect. I don't have the faith that all of them have done that.""Contributing: Alan Gomez",0
617,Democrats and Republicans remain at odds on how to avoid a round of budget cuts so deep and arbitrary that to allow them now could push the economy back into recession. The cuts known as a sequester will kick in March 1 unless Republicans agree to President Obama’s demand to a legislative package that combines spending reductions and tax increases. As of Thursday with the deadline a week off Republicans seemed determined to say no to any new tax increases.“Spending is the problem” declared the House speaker John Boehner. “Spending must be the focus.” Reflecting the views of many of her Republican colleagues Representative Martha Roby said Wednesday that Mr. Obama “already got his tax increase” as part of the January agreement over the “fiscal cliff” and that no further increases were necessary.Both are wrong. To reduce the deficit in a weak economy new taxes on high-income Americans are a matter of necessity and fairness; they are also a necessary precondition to what in time will have to be tax increases on the middle class. Contrary to Mr. Boehner’s “spending problem” claim much of the deficit in the next 10 years can be chalked up to chronic revenue shortfalls from the Bush-era tax cuts which were only partly undone in the fiscal-cliff deal earlier this year. (Wars and a recession also contributed.) It stands to reason that a deficit caused partly by inadequate revenue must be corrected in part by new taxes. And the only way to raise taxes now without harming the recovery is to impose them on high-income filers for whom a tax increase is unlikely to cut into spending.As it happens those taxpayers are the same ones who benefited most from Bush-era tax breaks and who continue to pay low taxes. Even with recent increases the new top rate of 39.6 percent is historically low; investment income is still taxed at special low rates; and the heirs of multimillion-dollar estates face lower taxes than at almost any time in modern memory.,0
618,WASHINGTON — Two weeks before deep budget cuts are due to slice across the federal government Senate Democrats proposed an alternative Thursday that would swap some reductions for a tax on people who make more than $1 million a year.The proposal has little chance of Republican support even though neither party wants the automatic cuts. But Republicans are increasingly willing to stomach the reductions in defense and domestic spending rather than accept President Obama’s call for a “balanced” approach that matches cuts with new revenue.AdvertisementThe Democratic alternative would replace half of the scheduled cuts with the so-called Buffett Rule a requirement that those who have adjusted gross incomes above $1 million pay a minimum 30% tax rate.The rule a favorite of the president is named for billionaire investor Warren Buffett who has complained that tax loopholes and deductions allow him to pay a lower effective tax rate than his secretary.Advertisement“Now Republicans in Congress face a simple choice” White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said in a statement. “Do they protect investments in education healthcare and national defense or do they continue to prioritize and protect tax loopholes that benefit the very few at the expense of middle- and working-class Americans?”The White House and its Democratic allies in the Senate are returning to a strategy that has shown some success — portraying Republicans as protecting tax breaks for the wealthy at the expense of deep reductions in popular domestic programs.AdvertisementPolls show that although Americans agree with Republicans that deficits are worrisome and that spending should be reduced enthusiasm wanes when the cuts slice into mainstay programs in transportation education or other government services.At the same time majorities of Americans have shown a willingness to ask the wealthiest to pay more as happened when Obama secured a tax increase on households earning more than $450000 in the New Year’s deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff.AdvertisementRepublicans are gambling that by resisting the president’s call for new taxes they will win the budget reductions that they were unable to achieve in the deal.House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) asserted that the cuts called sequestration will begin March 1 unless serious changes are made in federal spending to achieve the Republican goal of bringing the budget into balance within 10 years. Nonpartisan analysts noting that would extract federal money from the still-struggling economy say that could damage the recovery.Advertisement“The sequester will be in effect until there are cuts and reforms that put us on the path to balance the budget over the next 10 years” Boehner said Thursday.The $120-billion proposal from Democrats would postpone the across-the-board cuts for 10 months to make time to craft a broader solution. The Democratic package includes $55 billion in new revenue primarily from the tax on the wealthy along with cuts to farm subsidies and a smaller hit to defense than the automatic cuts coming next month.AdvertisementDemocrats dropped a proposal to close tax breaks on oil companies after protests from four oil-state Democratic senators.The across-the-board cuts would eliminate as many as 750000 jobs and reduce the growth of the nation’s gross domestic product according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.AdvertisementBoehner met privately Thursday with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) but the speaker has resisted the closed-door negotiations that characterized past fiscal battles because they drew protests from lawmakers in his Republican majority.Instead Boehner has shifted the burden of devising legislation to replace sequestration onto the Senate as he has struggled to rally support for proposals from his divided GOP majority in the House.AdvertisementSenate Republicans plan to present their own alternative. Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) would replace the across-the-board cuts with a plan to reduce the federal workforce by hiring only one new employee for every three vacancies.The Democratic and Republican alternatives probably will come to a vote when Congress returns from its weeklong Presidents Day recess.AdvertisementBoth parties’ proposals are likely to fail leaving Congress without a clear alternative days before the cuts begin.lisa.mascaro@latimes.com,0
619,The only fili that has winner written all over her face.The only fili that has winner written all over her face.I'm going to be brief and direct.You want to know why Hillary Clinton is leading among all Democrats by huge margins? It is simple: She is the only Democrat big enough to separate from President Obama in 2016 and still win a general election. You can't name anybody else who can do that.Why would any Democrat want to do that? It is simple: Because even 3 years from now we are still going to have a shitty economy. President Obama's legacy on the economy is pretty much set: slow middling growth coupled with vast inequality and poverty. Eight more years of treading water is hard sell. You'd have to be an idiot to run on the Obama economic record. For any other Democrat there will be no avoiding it.The cyclic nature of politics should mean the tide is against us.

620,"While the Obama administration says automatic spending cuts will mean budget pain for Americans everywhere lawmakers say the government is sitting on more than enough money to soften the blow.The sequester is expected to take a $85 billion bite out of the fiscal 2013 budget though only half of that impact is expected to be felt this year.But lawmakers say the government already has $45 billion in unspent money which could be used to offset the shortfall""There are pots of money sitting in different departments across the federal government that have been authorized over either ... a number of months or a number of years"" Rep. Tom Price R-Ga. said.Fresh legislation would authorize that money which hasn't yet been spent to be used elsewhere.Price introduced that legislation Tuesday along with Sen. Marco Rubio R-Fla. It would require the director of the White House budget office to rescind funds that haven't yet been obligated.More On This...""Washington's reckless spending culture has produced this situation where hundreds of billions of dollars are borrowed and then left unspent because Congress routinely bites off more than it can chew"" Rubio said in a statement.Republican Sen. Tom Coburn has also identified several programs at the Pentagon he'd set aside including a video called ""grill sergeants"" in which the instructors show their favorite recipes; money for a plan to send a space ship to another solar system; funds to find advancements in beef jerky from France; and $6 billion on questionable research including what lessons about democracy and decision-making could be learned -- from fish.Coburn and others also refer to what they call ""duplication nation"" -- dozens of programs intended for the same purpose.""There are 50 different literacy agencies 100 different programs focused on science tech and engineering"" Sen. John Barrasso R-Wyo. said.Nevertheless one Democrat mocked those who argue Washington should cut back the way families do.""Can't we just cut 2 percent just like American families?"" said Sen. Barbara Mikulski D-Md. echoing the question posed repeatedly by GOP lawmakers. ""American families don't run prisons. They don't build their own roads. They don't have to put out their own local police department.""Though Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano argues the sequester threatens border security Citizens Against Government Waste President Tom Schatz says the department has $9 billion dollars in unspent preparedness funds.He also cited one government study that found 47 job training programs across the federal government.Further critics point to $90000 spent to upgrade security at a spring training site in Arizona for professional baseball teams.Then there's allegations of waste at the General Services Administration. The agency which runs federal properties won notoriety when a regional director famously memorialized a lavish government-paid trip to Vegas with a photo of himself in a hot tub.But aside from the money spent on conferences lawmakers note that many buildings in the GSA inventory go unused.In 2010 President Obama said GSA had roughly $15 billion in property that should be sold by 2014. Only a portion has been so far. As of January 2012 the administration claimed they had reduced real property spending by $2.4 billion from the sale of underutilized federal properties and better management.Some lawmakers hope that the panic over the sequester which will hit Friday absent any congressional intervention will force a closer look at wasteful spending.Fox News' Jim Angle contributed to this report.",1

623,Sen. Warren introducing her student loan bill.Sen. Elizabeth Warren introduced her first bill a simple proposal to give students the same loan rates as the nation's biggest banks. Her proposal would allow the cut-rate loans for students for one year to give Congress the time to come to agreement on a long-term solution to interest rates. Federal Stafford subsidized loan rates for new students are set to double on July 1 to 6.8 percent.Here's a snippet from her floor speech introducing the bill.“Some people say that we can’t afford to help our kids through school by keeping student loan interest rates low” said Senator Warren. “But right now as I speak the federal government offers far lower interest rates on loans every single day–they just don’t do it for everyone. Right now a big bank can get a loan through the Federal Reserve discount window at a rate of about 0.75%. But this summer a student who is trying to get a loan to go to college will pay almost 7%. In other words the federal government is going to charge students interest rates that are nine times higher than the rates for the biggest banks–the same banks that destroyed millions of jobs and nearly broke this economy. That isn’t right. And that is why I’m introducing legislation today to give students the same deal that we give to the big banks.” “Big banks get a great deal when they borrow money from the Fed” Senator Warren continued. “In effect the American taxpayer is investing in those banks. We should make the same kind of investment in our young people who are trying to get an education. Lend them the money and make them to pay it back but give our kids a break on the interest they pay. Let’s Bank on Students… Unlike the big banks students don’t have armies of lobbyists and lawyers. They have only their voices. And they call on us to do what is right.”Sen. Warren is selling herself a little short there. Students don't just have their voices. They have Elizabeth Warren's voice too. That's a damned good thing.Add your voice.

624,"Gov. Jerry Brown has a history of tangling with California’s public universities which pride themselves on their independence.As governor decades ago he shook up the UC Regents with such unconventional board appointments as music mogul David Geffen a local YMCA director and a Zen Buddhist porpoise expert. He said faculty pay should be reduced because professors derive “psychic income” from their job.Now he is challenging the UC and Cal State systems again -- minus the eccentricity. Brown hopes to use state purse strings to force down their expenses hold the line on tuition and fees and graduate more students more quickly.He wants more teaching less research and more online courses to save money and increase offerings. He says more students should be accepted from California’s community colleges.AdvertisementThe universities must “reconfigure themselves so that they are more effective and they’re able to do excellent work but do it in a way that will not keep the costs escalating” said the governor who attended UC Berkeley.It is unclear whether the schools will go along. The public universities are among the few areas to which Sacramento devotes a great deal of money without much say in how it is spent -- particularly in the UC system whose independence is enshrined in California’s Constitution. Relationships between governors and the two systems can be rocky.In the state budget he proposed last week Brown increased money for the two systems by more than $250 million each -- less than they requested but enough to avert tuition hikes in the fall leaders of both systems have indicated. If they want more in the future the governor said they’ll need to do as he asks.Brown who sits on the boards of both systems will make his pitch to UC Regents in San Francisco on Wednesday and to the Cal State University Board of Trustees in Long Beach next week.AdvertisementSome university leaders said they welcome his input.“I personally am overjoyed” said Sherry Lansing the former head of Paramount Studios who is now the president of the UC Regents. “For me there’s nothing better than to have the governor come so he can understand the problems that we’re facing and work with us to find some solutions.”In addition to a 12% to 18% funding hike in the coming fiscal year Brown is proposing 4% to 5% increases for both systems over the four subsequent years if they will keep student costs steady during that time.He wants limits on the number of units that students can take charging more for those who accumulate more credits without graduating. That he said would free up space for others to get courses they need to finish their degrees in a timely manner.AdvertisementThe governor has said both systems should trim their administrative expenses. A 2010 study by a faculty group showed the number of senior administrators had increased by 125% since 1997 while the number of students increased 33%.“I’ve got a whole book showing how the university is spending money it doesn’t have to” Brown has said referring to “certain kinds of research sports gardeners a lot of things.”Former Regent Ward Connerly said the universities frown upon meddling by governors and other politicians.“There’s a feeling that this is our domain and the governor shouldn’t be too engaged shouldn’t be playing in our backyard” he said in an interview.Advertisement“That creates a tendency to resist.”Former Gov. Gray Davis who served on both boards from 1995 to 2003 as lieutenant governor and governor said academics “have a much longer time horizon and move much more slowly.”“If they don’t want to do something you propose” Davis said “they will just slow-walk you and wait for you to be out of office.”But Brown has been working for months to cultivate university leaders even taking the unusual step of participating in regents meetings. He needed the schools’ support for his tax hikes passed by voters in November and the universities were happy to help: The new revenue spared them $500 million in combined budget cuts.AdvertisementRobert Powell chairman of the UC Academic Senate said he and other faculty leaders met for three hours with the governor in Oakland last fall.“He was really drilling down” asking detailed questions about increasing summer courses the obstacles students face to graduating in four years and the possibility of three-year degrees Powell said.But he was skeptical of Brown’s hope that online courses would save significant money.“You’re not going to teach students more cheaply” he said. “No one has demonstrated an ability to do that.”AdvertisementBob Samuels president of the UC union for more than 4000 lecturers and librarians said his members have mixed feelings about the new attention from Brown. They appreciate being spared the budget ax but they’re wary too.History has shown Samuels said that Brown “is a very unpredictable person.”William Tierney director of USC’s Pelias Center for Higher Education welcomed Brown’s overtures.“Significant reform of higher education almost always happens when the governor is centrally involved” Tierney said adding that Brown should use the political capital from his tax victory to also tackle such challenging issues as duplicative courses and administrative functions.AdvertisementBrown says he’ll be “listening a lot” as he pursues change and his approach will be less sensational than in the past.“Before when I used to go to the regents I’d go armed and I was attacking” Brown said. ""... You’ve got to be more subtle; you need more allies.”--anthony.york@latimes.comAdvertisementTimes staff writer Larry Gordon contributed to this report.",1
625,President Obama on Friday visited the innovative Brooklyn high school he praised in his State of the Union address this year to deliver a message about the urgency of education reform in the global economy.Mr. Obama dressed in shirt sleeves was showered with cheers by the visibly energized students and a cadre of New York politicians as he took the podium at Pathways in Technology Early College High School. “Hello Brooklyn” he said before starting into his argument for creating more schools like the one he was visiting casting them as essential in preparing the next generation for competition in a shrinking world marketplace.“This country should be doing everything in our power to give more kids the chance to go to schools just like this one” the president said calling the school known as P-Tech a ticket into the middle class.“In previous generations America’s standing economically was so much higher than everybody else’s that we didn’t have a lot of competition” he added. “Now you’ve got billions of people from Beijing to Bangalore to Moscow all of whom are competing with you directly. And they’re — those countries are working every day to out-educate and outcompete us.”,0

627,"He warned that the decision by Senate Democrats to repeatedly vote together against GOP-backed budget proposals -- including a measure that Cruz claimed would repeal the congressional exemption from the new health-care law -- means that vulnerable House and Senate Democrats will suffer political consequences during next year’s midterm elections.“I promise you come October and November of 2014 we’re going to see TV commercials all over this country of Democrats who voted to give themselves a special exemption to Obamacare that their constituents don’t get and there are going to be some Democratic members of Congress and of the Senate who are suddenly going to be experiencing the joys of the private health-care system” Cruz told the crowd.The comments suggest that Cruz is preparing to take an even more active role in calling out his Democratic colleagues for actions taken during the shutdown -- even though Democrts have generally emerged victorious from the standoff at least according to public opinion polls. Any new effort by Cruz to blunt Senate Democrats would be notable since he is a vice chairman of the National Senatorial Campaign Committee and has been criticized by some for doing little to help bolster the party’s chances of retaking the Senate next year.The senator delivered a series of well-worn jokes and zingers heard before on the Senate floor or in similar speeches in other early-primary states including South Carolina.Promising a sellout crowd of 600 people that he wouldn’t speak for as long as he did during his recent 21-hour marathon filibuster-like speech on the Senate floor Cruz began by joking that “Twenty-one hours is a long time. That’s almost as long as it takes to sign up on the Obamacare Web site.”As he did during a similar state party function in South Carolina in May Cruz avoided using a lectern and instead paced the stage with a wireless microphone pinned to his necktie. He began by chastising the Obama administration for being “bent on violating every constitutional protection."" He retold the life story of his father Rafael Cruz a Cuban immigrant. And he repeatedly poked fun at “conventional wisdom” emanating from Washington.Unlike previous addresses however Cruz was accompanied Friday night by his wife Heidi Nelson Cruz a rare political trip for her outside of Texas. The joint appearance came just days after a high-profile New York Times profile that discussed the couple's relationship and finances and her work for Goldman Sachs.Looking beyond the health-care fight Cruz at one point discussed the need for Republicans to focus much more intently on economic growth.“If we don’t have growth we can’t achieve anything” he told the crowd. Arguing that even modest economic growth could generate trillions of dollars in tax revenues and deficit reduction he said “That’s what the Republican Party needs to be about. We need to be about economic growth all the time every day that’s how we turn the country around.”In a nod to the growing power and popularity of grassroots conservatives he listed five instances in the past year where a groundswell of conservative support helped blunt Obama administration policies: During a filibuster by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) against U.S. drone policy; during the Senate debate over gun control; during the summer's immigration debate; when Republicans joined Democrats in raising concerns about President Obama's plans in Syria; and most recently during the government shutdown.Cruz eagerly sought to harness that grassroots support by asking people in the crowd to use their cellphones to text the word “growth” to a number tied to his political organization -- a modern-age way to collect the names and numbers of potential political supporters. He made a similar request during his South Carolina speech in May.That request plus Cruz's appearance in the state that hosts the first presidential caucuses will once again fuel speculation about his political future. He demurred when asked afterward by reporters whether the trip was in preparation for a presidential bid.The visit was Cruz's third to Iowa this year but his longest yet. He arrived Friday afternoon in time for his speech and on Saturday plans to join Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) on the congressman’s annual pheasant hunt and “Defenders of Freedom” fundraiser in Akron and Le Mars two towns in the conservative northwest corner of the state. He will fly home Sunday to celebrate the birthday of his 3-year old daughter.Cruz is not the only would-be GOP presidential candidate spending time in Iowa these days. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) who was the 2012 Republican vice presidential candidate will be in the state next month to attend a fundraiser for Republican Gov. Terry Branstad. And Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) made a well-received trip to the state last spring shortly after he mounted a filibuster in opposition to domestic spying programs.Follow Ed O'Keefe on Twitter: @edatpost",1
628,For Mitt Romney there will be no next chapter in politics — at least no third run for the presidency. But in his first post-campaign interview the former Massachusetts governor did not shy away Sunday from his criticism of President Obama and said he hoped to help the Republican Party regain its footing — from a distance.“I recognize that as the guy who lost the election I’m not in a position to tell everybody else how to win” Romney told “Fox News Sunday” host Chris Wallace. “They’re not going to listen and I don’t have the credibility to do that anyway. But I still care. And I still believe that there are principles that we need to stand for.”Criticizing the stalemate on the sequester — $85 billion in automatic spending cuts that are slated to go into effect because Democrats and Republicans could not reach an agreement — the former GOP nominee accused the president of “campaigning” by flying around the country “berating Republicans” instead of pulling aside Democrats and a few Republicans to cut a deal.“It kills me not to be there not to be in the White House doing what needs to be done” Romney told Wallace. “The president is the leader of the nation. The president brings people together does the deals does the trades knocks the heads together; the president leads. And I don’t see that kind of leadership happening right now.”Romney said the nation was in the midst of “a golden moment” to fix its fiscal problems but was watching it “slip away with politics.” Obama he charged has been more interested in winning a political victory than resolving the issue: “This is America we’re talking about at a critical time” he said “You know Nero is fiddling.”Since his loss in November Romney has largely faded from public view—retreating to his oceanfront home in La Jolla and enjoying outings with his grandchildren at the beach Disneyland and local parks. Sources close to the former governor say he is still weighing his next steps but has turned his energy toward the charitable foundation that he founded with his wife Ann. They have renamed it the Romney Foundation for Children to focus on the plight of poor children around the world.When on the East Coast Romney has been working out of the Boston offices of Solamere the venture capital firm founded by his son Tagg and his former campaign finance director Spencer Zwick. He has told friends that he intends to help out at Solamere as well at the businesses of three of his other sons who work in real estate development.Reflecting on the 2012 campaign Romney told Wallace that he and his team had not done an effective job reaching out to minority voters which he called “a real mistake.” He did not apologize for his assertion to donors last fall that Obama had won the election by giving “gifts” to key groups including African Americans Latinos and young people.The remarks drew criticism from many of Romney’s fellow Republicans in part because they were reminiscent of his controversial comment at a private Florida fundraiser that 47% of Americans were looking for handouts and weren’t likely to vote for him.“The president had the power of incumbency. Obamacare was very attractive particularly to those without health insurance. And they came out in large numbers to vote” Romney told Wallace when asked about the “gifts” comment.When Wallace noted that the former Massachusetts governor had been “roasted” by members of his party over the remarks and asked if that hurt Romney said he wasn’t “going to second-guess what other people have to say.”“I don’t look back. I look forward” he said.Putting an end to a swirl of speculation earlier this year Ann Romney said she was never formally approached by the Republican Party about running for the Massachusetts U.S. Senate seat vacated by Secretary of State John Kerry. “Not a chance” she told Wallace when asked if she’d considered running. “I’m enjoying life.”She did confirm however that she considered taking a spot on “Dancing With the Stars” and “would’ve loved to have done it.”But she said “I am turning 64 and I started thinking about it — I’m not really as flexible as I should be.”The selection of Dorothy Hamill as a contestant she said confirmed that she had made the right decision. “I thought oh my gosh am I glad I didn’t do that!

629,The lunch speaker for Saturday’s session of the California Republican Party convention had to talk by video as he was trapped in Washington due to the days-long government shutdown.Metaphor? Yes.Rep. Greg Walden’s absence from the Anaheim gathering exemplified the shadow the Capitol standoff has cast across grass-roots Republicans eying next year’s elections. In Anaheim as in Washington the mood among Republicans seemed to meld support for the goals of GOP congressional leaders and an expectation that Republicans would pay a price for them.Everyone at the event from congressional Republicans on down was trying to push blame for the shutdown onto Democrats in defiance of national polls showing more Americans blame Republicans than President Obama or his party.Advertisement“I sure wish I could be with you in person but as you’ve seen a few things are going on in Washington as we fight to stand up for our Republican principles” Walden who represents a district in Oregon said on the video played to a few hundred delegates.“Getting anything done has been incredibly difficult as we have a president and a Democratically-controlled Senate who refuse even to even negotiate and work with Republicans to fund the government and make changes to Obamacare. Even on important nonpartisan issues like cancer funding and keeping the World War II memorial open to World War II veterans the Democrats refuse to budge.”He echoed what Sharon Day co-chair of the Republican National Committee had said a day earlier when she was asked if the federal government shutdown would harm Republican chances next year. She angrily denounced President Obama and Harry Reid the Democratic leader of the Senate for their tactics and what she described as efforts to bait Republicans.“If you look at it they have truly become the ‘party of no’ in this battle” she said using a sobriquet frequently flung at Republicans. “I’d like to see the president and I’d like to see Harry Reid stop throwing around statements and comments that are not helpful and I’d like them to sit down and compromise. …Advertisement“If you remember it was the senators who didn’t show up to work on the bill while the Republican Congress worked till midnight. It was the president that played golf while the Republican Congress individuals continued to work and try to find solutions.”Inevitably however she turned to the impact.“Does it have an impact? I guess it will have an impact” she said her body language implying the fallout would be negative: “But the right thing is what I believe -- what the Congress is doing is trying to find solutions unlike the president and Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi who just simply say ‘I want it all I want it now and I don’t care what your compromises are I’m not even going to show up to work and do my job.’”Jim Brulte the state Republican Party chairman declined to say whether he thought Republicans would pay for the shutdown. But an analogy he drew — the fact that President George H. W. Bush was intensely popular in 1991 and lost his reelection race in 1992 — suggested he thought the fallout for Republicans might be short-lived.Advertisement“For anyone to suggest that they know what’s going to happen in November of 2014 based on what’s happening in October of 2013 is either a prophet or a fool” he said. “And I may be one but I try not to be either of them.”cathleen.decker@latimes.comTwitter: @cathleendecker,0

631,"This morning CNN had only released some of the results of their poll. Now they've released the second part and boy it's a doozy for the GOP.In a sign of the political hangover congressional Republicans are suffering in the wake of the government shutdown three-quarters of Americans in a new national poll say that most GOP members of Congress don't deserve to be re-elected. A CNN/ORC International survey released Monday also found a majority saying that the Republicans' policies are too extreme. And according to the poll Democrats have an 8-point advantage over the Republicans in an early indicator in the battle for control of Congress. But with more than a year to go until the 2014 midterm elections there's plenty of time for these numbers to change. .... More than seven in 10 questioned in the survey said that most members of Congress don't deserve to be re-elected with nearly four in 10 saying even their own representative doesn't deserve a return ticket to Washington next year. Both figures are hovering around all-time highs in CNN polling. ""Although incumbent members of Congress of both parties are not very popular the shutdown seems to have only affected views of GOP incumbents"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. Three-fourths of people questioned in the survey said that most congressional Republicans don't deserved to be re-elected 21 percentage points higher than the 54% who say most Democrats don't deserve another term in office. Only one in five say most Republicans deserve to be re-elected; 42% say the same thing about Democrats on Capitol Hill.Deserve re-election?Yes NoDem 40% 56%GOP 20% 76%Now this question was asked of all Americans and NOT of registered voters (and obviously not of likely voters). The CNN pollask it of registered voters as well and from the smaller sample registered voters were slightly more angry at both parties. Here I've put it in chart form.Of note that 40% for Democrats among registered voters is actually not the worst we've seen in recent history. The August 2010 numbers had only 36% of registered voters saying Democrats deserved re-election to Congress. However that 20% for the GOP is thein the poll's history by far surpassing the previous low of just 31% taken back in August 2011 during the last debt ceiling fight.This is now spilling over into the generic ballot question as well.Fifty percent of registered voters questioned said they would vote for the Democrat in their district with 42% backing the Republican. The 8-point Democratic margin in the CNN poll is the same as in a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey and close to the 9-point advantage for the Democrats in the generic ballot in a recent Quinnipiac University poll. ""We're a long way away from saying that the Democrats have a chance to regain control of the House"" Holland cautioned. ""There is more than a year to go before any votes are actually cast and the 'generic ballot' question is not necessarily a good predictor of the actual outcome of 435 separate elections. A year before the 2010 midterms for example the Democrats held a 6-point lead on the generic ballot."" The Republicans eventually won back control of the House in 2010 thanks to a historic 63-seat pickup.So again while the signs look good now they looked good for Democrats as well in 2010 and we all know the misery that followed. The generic ballot question almost always overestimates how well Democrats will do an entire year out from the actual election. Notice in 2006 a good year for Democrats it only overestimated by a tiny bit. But in the midterm years good for the GOP like 2002 and 2010 anyone thinking we were going to do OK because of the generic ballot question was in for a rude awakening. So recent history tells us that even if 2014 turns out to be a good year for Democrats the generic ballot question STILL overestimates how well we're going to do a year ahead but only by a little.Notice in the 2010 average of the polls on October 21 2009 (exactly 4 years ago) Democrats held a 45%-39.5% advantage on the generic ballot question. And then a year later a massive 63-seat loss in the House with Republicans actually getting 51.6% of the vote and Democrats only getting 44.8% of the vote.So while this poll is good news don't you dare take anything for granted just yet.",0
632,Much of the media commentary on President Obama’s big inequality speech was cynical. You know the drill: it’s yet another “reboot” that will go nowhere; none of it will have any effect on policy and so on. But before we talk about the speech’s possible political impact or lack thereof shouldn’t we look at the substance? Was what the president said true? Was it new? If the answer to these questions is yes — and it is — then what he said deserves a serious hearing.And once you realize that you also realize that the speech may matter a lot more than the cynics imagine.First about those truths: Mr. Obama laid out a disturbing — and unfortunately all too accurate — vision of an America losing touch with its own ideals an erstwhile land of opportunity becoming a class-ridden society. Not only do we have an ever-growing gap between a wealthy minority and the rest of the nation; we also he declared have declining mobility as it becomes harder and harder for the poor and even the middle class to move up the economic ladder. And he linked rising inequality with falling mobility asserting that Horatio Alger stories are becoming rare precisely because the rich and the rest are now so far apart.This isn’t entirely new terrain for Mr. Obama. What struck me about this speech however was what he had to say about the sources of rising inequality. Much of our political and pundit class remains devoted to the notion that rising inequality to the extent that it’s an issue at all is all about workers lacking the right skills and education. But the president now seems to accept progressive arguments that education is at best one of a number of concerns that America’s growing class inequality largely reflects political choices like the failure to raise the minimum wage along with inflation and productivity.,0
633,Even if all the hidden money funneled into campaigns through private 501(c) organizations had come from businesses — unlikely given the contributions by noncorporate groups like Planned Parenthood and the N.R.A. — corporate spending would not reach $400 million still a small share of the total.Perhaps this should not be surprising. For companies spending on elections can be risky. Business executives might prefer lobbying where they spend far more than on campaign contributions not because the limits are more relaxed but because swaying legislators on both sides of the aisle is more effective at getting what they want. And such lobbying is less likely to kindle anger among consumers shareholders and other constituents than spending to change the outcome of elections.“While Citizens alters the ability of corporations to contribute to campaigns it does not alter their substantial risk in doing so” the political scientists Wendy L. Hansen Michael Rocca and Brittany Ortiz of the University of New Mexico Albuquerque argued in a recent study.Still corporations’ reluctance to open their checkbooks suggests an intriguing alternative explanation for the rise of Republicans who are willing to defy their will: companies may have spent too little. Their money was swamped by that of big individual donors who are more ideologically extreme. In 2012 the top 0.1 percent of donors contributed more than 44 percent of all campaign contributions. In 1980 their share of contributions was less than 10 percent.Corporations have a pro-Republican bias of course. But it is not quite as extreme as pop culture would have it and is certainly less pronounced than organized labor’s pro-Democrat leanings.Effective lobbying requires both Republican and Democratic friends. Political action committees run by businesses are known for spreading money on both sides of the partisan divide. They give to incumbents. They choose winners. They show little partisan loyalty.In the 2006 elections when the G.O.P. controlled Congress corporate PACs gave 65 percent of their money to Republicans. In 2008 and 2010 after the Democrats had swept both the House and Senate they split their contributions roughly fifty-fifty.,0

635,I have seen more powerful men than Barack Obama fall. I worked in South Africa during Thabo Mbeki’s presidency when the ruling African National Congress (ANC) won 70% of the vote and earned the power to change his country’s constitution unilaterally. In 2005 I watched from the gallery as he told Parliament he was dismissing his deputy Jacob Zuma over allegations of corruption stemming from a lucrative arms deal.Two years later Mbeki was ousted by his party and forced to resign his presidency of the country. Zuma is now president and the ruling party is both fractured by rivalries and weakened by the growing strength of the opposition Democratic Alliance. The growing current of dissent in South Africa is not primarily over principles or policies but over clashes over the spoils of power in a time of economic stagnation and turmoil.President Obama holds unprecedented sway over his own party–and yet the first signs of internal tension are already bursting into the open. The news that he has turned his campaign into a permanent non-profit organizing outfit to push for his policies has been greeted with frustration by members of the Democratic National Committee who see the new “Organizing for Action” group as a competitor for fundraising dollars and power.The Hill reports on the open dissatisfaction at the DNC:DNC members said they were caught off guard when the leaders of the president’s reelection team announced Obama for America was morphing into Organizing for Action (OFA) a nonprofit group that can take unlimited “soft money” donations….While the new group will seek to go toe to toe with GOP outside groups like Crossroads GPS some Democrats aren’t pleased that Obama didn’t fold his powerful grassroots operation back into the DNC.The looming fights over spending deficits and debts also threatens the coalition that re-elected President Obama. The Obama administration designed a sequester whose non-defense cuts would scare as many voters and interest groups as possible. It expected that sequester to be canceled; now there is a strong chance that it may go through. If it does interest groups and lobbies may find themselves fighting each other–and Obama.Many of the president’s strongest backers were prepared to wait until the election was over to demand their money’s worth. Hollywood for example watched the defeat of the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) in frustration–and patiently waited for Obama to return to office. Now having won its tax benefits in the fiscal cliff talks it may revive SOPA again.Yet it will have to compete with other interest groups in the Democrats’ coalition who believe that the president was not aggressive enough in his first term and are no longer willing to accept the idea that compromise with Republicans is necessary. The rush to redeem promises made by Obama to each of these constituencies will likely increase friction within Democratic ranks–just as Republicans are pressing their case on debt.That is why the most important opposition to Obama may come from within–some on matters of principle such as the loose alliance of liberal and pro-Israel groups opposing Chuck Hagel’s nomination for Secretary of Defense; and others on pure self-interest. Republican opposition will still be critical especially given the effective veto the House still holds. But it will likely be given a boost by Democrats’ own greed and impatience.,1
636,"Martha T. MooreUSA TODAYDemocrats try to lump GOP candidates under Tea Party bannerThe movement began by focusing on economic and tax issues%2C not social issuesRepublicans say they should focus on their common ground%2C not labelsThe failure of Tea Party-backed candidates in Tuesday's election shows that Democrats have been successful in making the Tea Party label a negative for Republicans even if it isn't always clear what being a Tea Party candidate means.Exit polls in Virginia where Republican Ken Cucinelli lost to Democrat Terry McAuliffe show 42% of voters had a negative opinion of the Tea Party movement. Those voters went overwhelmingly for McAuliffe. A Tea Party-affiliated Republican in Alabama Dean Young lost a congressional primary against Bradley Byrne who was backed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business interests. In New Jersey voters re-elected Republican Gov. Chris Christie by a landslide while expressing dislike of both the Republican Party (57%) and the Tea Party movement (45%) exit polls show.Democrats touted those results in a conference call Wednesday. ""The Republican brand and the Tea Party brand are one and the same and people do not like either'' said Mo Elleithee Democratic National Committee spokesman.""There is no distinction in the mind of voters.''By emphasizing the Tea Party ties of social conservatives such as Cuccinelli Young and former Missouri congressman Todd Akin Democrats are able to blur the distinction between the limited government/less spending origins of the Tea Party and the staunch opposition to gay marriage and abortion of Republican conservatives.Democrats conflate the Tea Party and the GOP ""because they see that it hurts us'' says Keli Carender national grass-roots director of the Tea Party Patriots. ""Social issues are so hot button that it's easy for Democrats to make them the main point when they're talking about somebody.''October's government shutdown was pushed by Tea Party leaders Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah but supported by a majority of congressional Republicans — further eroding the distinction between the Tea Party and the GOP.Tea Party principles had been ""perverted'' by Republicans in Washington who ""use that theory just to try to enhance themselves politically'' Christie a critic of the shutdown said this week on CNN. Republicans should have been emphasizing instead their success in cutting government spending through the sequester which imposed automatic spending cuts he said.""The core of the Tea Party movement as I understand it I think is very consistent with good conservative Republicanism'' Christie said in the CNN interview. ""But some of the stuff that's happened of late down in Washington I think is not even consistent with what a lot of the real folks who started the Tea Party movement would agree with.''The Tea Party is blurry by definition because it's a movement not a party says Adam Brandon of the Tea Party group Freedom Works. ""The Tea Party is an easy punching bag ... from the left and it's a punching bag from the right. There's no one out there really defending it'' he says. ""It's too easy to fall into a situation where if you're a challenger you're automatically a Tea Party candidate (or) if you're not handpicked by the establishment you're a Tea Party candidate.''What works instead Brandon says is for Republicans to avoid labels and talk about cutting spending and taxes the Tea Party's core issues. ""Even if people have a negative view of the Tea Party they have a positive view of all these issues we're talking about.''Rob Collins chief strategist for the Senate GOP's 2014 campaign operation said Democrats' focus on GOP divisions is overstated. ""It's not so much an ideological rift it's more of a tactical rift. Strategically we all want the same thing"" he told reporters this week.But Collins acknowledged that the GOP is facing pressure not only from grass-roots activists and outside groups that are attempting to harness them but also increasingly from its mainstream constituencies such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the business lobby .""There's a whole lot of folks out there that are Tea Party and then there's — call them what you want — the elites the D.C.-based leaders of folks … and those are different creatures"" Collins said. ""In order for us to win in the fall and also elect the right candidate we need the Tea Party we need the business crowd we need everybody pulling on the same oar.""That may not happen Carender says. If voters now see little distinction between Republicans and Tea Partiers they should wait until 2014 when the conflict between establishment GOP and grass-roots-backed candidates will make the distinctions clear she says.

637,On Wednesday the Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee Jeff Sessions (R-AL) said he plans to vigorously oppose President Barack Obama’s Treasury Secretary nominee Jack Lew.“Jack Lew must never be Secretary of Treasury” said Mr. Sessions in a statement. “His testimony before the Senate Budget Committee less than two years ago was so outrageous and false that it alone disqualifies.”On Feb. 13 2011 Mr. Lew appeared on CNN’s State of the Union with Candy Crowley and said of Mr. Obama’s proposed budget:Our budget will get us over the next several years to the point where we can look the American people in the eye and say we’re not adding to the debt anymore; we’re spending money that we have each year and then we can work on bringing down our national debt.During Senate testimony Mr. Sessions blasted Mr. Lew’s false statement and said he was “flatly in error”:Lew who is a former director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has at times displayed a striking level of ignorance over how the budgetary process operates.During the Crowley interview Mr. Lew said that the reason Mr. Obama has failed to pass a budget in the Senate is because such bills can be filibustered. But as anyone familiar with the process knows budgets are considered “privileged” meaning they do not require a filibuster-proof majority 60 votes and can instead be passed with a simple majority.Mr. Lew repeated the elementary error to NBC’s David Gregory. “One of the things about the United States Senate that I think the American people don’t realize” said Mr. Lew confidently “is that it takes 60 votes not 50 to pass something.”One would think the former head of OMB–the nation’s top budget post–would know how the budget process works. But apparently Mr. Lew does not.Now Mr. Lew has been nominated to become Treasury Secretary of the United States in the worst economy since the Great Depression. That says Mr. Sessions cannot happen:It’s time for a Secretary of Treasury to look the American people in the eye and lay out an economic plan for America that will end our debt path that has endangered our future and which will find support among the American people and the world’s financial community. Far from being a positive force towards this essential good Mr. Lew has given priority to the political interests of the President in whose White House inner circle he has now served for several years. At this time of unprecedented slow growth high unemployment and huge deficits we need a Secretary of Treasury that the American people the Congress and the world will know is up to the task of getting America on the path to prosperity not the path to decline. Jack Lew is not that man.Questions have also emerged over a $950000 bonus Mr. Lew received in 2009 in his role as chief operating officer of Citigroup’s Alternative Investments unit–a group that bet billions against homeowners paying their mortgages. Mr. Obama has previously railed against “obscene” Wall Street bonuses wherein “fat cats” get “awarded for their failure.” Still Mr. Lew took the money.In a letter to Mr. Lew Sen. Chuck Grassley asked “How is it in the public’s interest for you to receive a $1 million bonus on the eve of a massive $301 billion commitment to rescue Citigroup?”Mr. Lew’s response: “My position at Citi was a management position. I was not an investment adviser. My compensation was in line with other management executives at the firm and in similarly complex operations.”It is presently unknown whether Mr. Sessions plans to filibuster the Jack Lew nomination.,1

640,"An overwhelming majority of voters are opposed to cutting off extended jobless benefits for the unemployed a poll revealed on Monday.The left-leaning Public Policy Polling surveyed voters in four key congressional districts as well as House Speaker John Boehner's (R-Ohio) district to gauge support for extending unemployment benefits. The poll funded by the liberal advocacy group Americans United for Change showed that voters across party lines were overwhelmingly in favor of extending the benefits with 63 to 68 percent of voters in each district expressing support for preserving jobless benefits.Voters in the four districts surveyed said they were less likely to vote for the Republican incumbent in 2014 -- by at least a 9-point margin -- were he to vote to cut off extended unemployment benefits.Though jobless benefits are set to expire on Dec. 28 for 1.3 million longterm unemployed Americans members of the House and Senate have returned home for the holidays without a solution to preserve those benefits. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has said it was an ""immorality"" that the benefits weren't secured in a recent budget deal and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has promised to bring the extension to a vote no later than Jan. 7 2014.Moderate Republicans urged Boehner and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) to rescue jobless benefits for the longterm unemployed earlier in December saying the issue was ""important to many American families."" But Boehner would only consider the proposal if cuts were made elsewhere and job growth guaranteed and the measure ultimately did not make it into Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Rep. Paul Ryan's (R-Wis.) budget deal.""Speaker Boehner and fellow Washington Republicans are hopelessly out-of-touch and their decision to Scrooge over a million unemployed Americans three days after Christmas is the latest and among the worst examples of it"" Jeremy Funk communications director of Americans United for Change said. ""All these struggling Americans got from the GOP for Christmas was a ‘Get Employed Soon’ card.""Funk warned cuts to jobless benefits for the longterm unemployed would only put more Americans out of work and bring a chain reaction of economic fallout in 2014.""But it’s not just in America’s economic interest to extend [unemployment insurance] benefits these polls show it’s in swing district Republicans’ own political interest to support the jobless in their districts"" Funk said.

Who is responsible? What really happened?The finger-pointing began during the third presidential debate last fall on Oct. 22 when President Obama blamed Congress. “The sequester is not something that I’ve proposed” Obama said. “It is something that Congress has proposed.”The White House chief of staff at the time Jack Lew who had been budget director during the negotiations that set up the sequester in 2011 backed up the president two days later.1 of 92 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles on the budget battle View Photos Collection of cartoons on the federal budget and economy. Caption A collection of cartoons on the budget and the economy. October 4 2013 Tom Toles Wait 1 second to continue.“There was an insistence on the part of Republicans in Congress for there to be some automatic trigger” Lew said while campaigning in Florida. It “was very much rooted in the Republican congressional insistence that there be an automatic measure.”The president and Lew had this wrong. My extensive reporting for my book “The Price of Politics” shows that the automatic spending cuts were initiated by the White House and were the brainchild of Lew and White House congressional relations chief Rob Nabors — probably the foremost experts on budget issues in the senior ranks of the federal government.Obama personally approved of the plan for Lew and Nabors to propose the sequester to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). They did so at 2:30 p.m. July 27 2011 according to interviews with two senior White House aides who were directly involved.Nabors has told others that they checked with the president before going to see Reid. A mandatory sequester was the only action-forcing mechanism they could devise. Nabors has said “We didn’t actually think it would be that hard to convince them” — Reid and the Republicans — to adopt the sequester. “It really was the only thing we had. There was not a lot of other options left on the table.”A majority of Republicans did vote for the Budget Control Act that summer which included the sequester. Key Republican staffers said they didn’t even initially know what a sequester was — because the concept stemmed from the budget wars of the 1980s when they were not in government.At the Feb. 13 Senate Finance Committee hearing on Lew’s nomination to become Treasury secretary Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) asked Lew about the account in my book: “Woodward credits you with originating the plan for sequestration. Was he right or wrong?”“It’s a little more complicated than that” Lew responded “and even in his account it was a little more complicated than that.

One is to avoid the $1.2 trillion in spending cuts included in sequestration and another is raising the country’s debt ceiling. Here is a look at some of the issues involved in these two fiscal challenges. Sequester If Congress and Obama can’t reach a deal to avoid sequestration then the country would see budget cuts of $1.2 trillion through 2021. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has said that the defense cuts would be a “disaster.” But if you look at this graph the blow isn't as bad as the military has faced in the past. Even if the sequestration was implemented the drop in spending would be less than the military experienced after the Korean Vietnam or Cold wars. The Center for Strategic and International Studies Wait 1 second to continue.“Did you make the suggestion?” Burr asked.“Well what I did was said that with all other options closed we needed to look for an option where we could agree on how to resolve our differences. And we went back to the 1984 plan that Senator [Phil] Gramm and Senator [Warren] Rudman worked on and said that that would be a basis for having a consequence that would be so unacceptable to everyone that we would be able to get action.”In other words yes.But then Burr asked about the president’s statement during the presidential debate that the Republicans originated it.Lew being a good lawyer and a loyal presidential adviser then shifted to denial mode: “Senator the demand for an enforcement mechanism was not something that the administration was pushing at that moment.”That statement was not accurate.On Tuesday Obama appeared at the White House with a group of police officers and firefighters to denounce the sequester as a “meat-cleaver approach” that would jeopardize military readiness and investments in education energy and readiness. He also said it would cost jobs. But the president said the substitute would have to include new revenue through tax reform.At noon that same day White House press secretary Jay Carney shifted position and accepted sequester paternity.“The sequester was something that was discussed” Carney said. Walking back the earlier statements he added carefully “and as has been reported it was an idea that the White House put forward.”This was an acknowledgment that the president and Lew had been wrong.Why does this matter?First months of White House dissembling further eroded any semblance of trust between Obama and congressional Republicans. (The Republicans are by no means blameless and have had their own episodes of denial and bald-faced message management.)Second Lew testified during his confirmation hearing that the Republicans would not go along with new revenue in the portion of the deficit-reduction plan that became the sequester. Reinforcing Lew’s point a senior White House official said Friday “The sequester was an option we were forced to take because the Republicans would not do tax increases.”In fact the final deal reached between Vice President Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in 2011 included an agreement that there would be no tax increases in the sequester in exchange for what the president was insisting on: an agreement that the nation’s debt ceiling would be increased for 18 months so Obama would not have to go through another such negotiation in 2012 when he was running for reelection.So when the president asks that a substitute for the sequester include not just spending cuts but also new revenue he is moving the goal posts. His call for a balanced approach is reasonable and he makes a strong case that those in the top income brackets could and should pay more. But that was not the deal he made.,1
644,The afterglow of President Obama’s reelection and inauguration appears to have vanished as increasingly negative views among Americans about his stewardship of the economy have forced his public approval rating back down to the 50 percent mark according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll.In December just after he won a second term Obama held an 18-percentage-point advantage over congressional Republicans on the question of whom the public trusted more to deal with the economy. Now it’s a far more even split — 44 percent to 40 percent with a slight edge for the president — but the share of those saying they have confidence in “neither” has ticked up into double digits.The poll contains ample evidence of the disillusionment voters feel toward both sides amid a sense of continuing dysfunction in Washington which since December has been grappling with fiscal crises and deadlines of its own making.Almost two weeks into the automatic across-the-board budget cuts known as the sequester a slim majority of Americans dis­approve of the reductions. At the same time nearly three-quarters say they are feeling no impact on their lives and fewer than half expect a toll on their family finances if the cuts continue.Still large majorities expect that the sequester will eventually damage the economy the military and the government’s ability to provide basic services. Most 68 percent say they would like the two sides to work together to come up with a deal to stop the cuts. The desire for cooperation is widely shared across party lines.View Graphic Obama’s reelection honeymoon endsAsked who is responsible for the sequester 47 percent say Republicans in Congress and 33 percent say Obama.The poll suggests a closer divide on which side the public trusts in the battles over issues such as immigration and gun control — closer perhaps than the public’s policy preferences would indicate. Americans largely support the administration’s stand on new measures to curb gun violence but on basic trust on the issue the president and Republicans in Congress fare about evenly.Obama’s overall job-approval rating stands at 50 percent down five points from before he took the oath of office in January. Looking along partisan lines the slippage since then has been particularly pronounced among political independents. Two months ago independents tilted clearly in his direction with 54 percent approving and 41 percent disapproving. Now half of independents express a negative opinion of the president’s performance; just 44 percent approve.The president has also seen an erosion in confidence among groups that he has counted as core supporters. Compared with a Post-ABC poll in December the share of liberals who place their faith in Obama over Republicans when it comes to dealing with the economy is 14 points lower; there has been a 12-point slide among women.At 50 percent Obama’s overall standing in the poll is lower than that of most other modern second-term presidents at this point in their terms. Of the seven second-term presidents who have been in office since Harry S. Truman only George W. Bush had a positive rating as low as 50 percent at this stage.Obama and Bush share another similarity one that describes what is arguably the most potent force shaping political decision-making in recent years: a deeply divided electorate. Among post-World War II presidents Bush and Obama are the only ones to have led a nation as politically polarized as it is today. In both cases there is a gap of more than 70 points between Democratic and Republican assessments of the president.Congress remains far lower than the president in public esteem with only 16 percent approving of its performance and 80 percent disapproving. That negative feeling extends to both parties with congressional Democrats registering a ratio of 34 percent favorable to 62 percent unfavorable sentiment; Republicans are lower still at 24 to 72.The poll was conducted March 7 to 10 among a random sample of 1001 adults. The full survey has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.At a moment when the statistics — a booming stock market and surprising new strength in the job market — suggest a more vigorous economy many Americans are not themselves seeing progress.Barely more than half of those surveyed say the economy has started its recovery. And after a brief foray into neutral territory most Americans again give Obama negative marks on handling the economy. The personal assessments of the economy’s trajectory relate directly to Obama’s overall rating: Seventy-three percent of those who say they sense economic growth approve of the way the president is doing his job and an identical 73 percent of those who don’t see a recovering economy disapprove of his performance in office.As they do on the economy the president and the Republican opposition have rough parity on the question of who is better positioned on gun control with Obama the choice of 42 percent and congressional Republicans 41 percent.On immigration Obama has a six-point advantage with 45 percent saying they trust him more and 39 percent expressing greater confidence in the Republicans’ approach. The margin may be surprisingly slender given big majority support for a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants and strong Latino support for Obama in the November election.Nor does the election seem to have produced a lasting consensus on which side is better equipped to figure out what government spending should be cut and what services preserved. When it comes to finding the right balance 44 percent side with Republicans and 43 percent with the president.The poll also confirms one of the political verities of deficit reduction: People may want to see an end to red ink but there is rarely public support for reductions in popular social programs to achieve it.Asked about alternatives to the automatic cuts now in place 71 percent reject a reduction in Medicaid the health insurance program for the poor and 60 percent oppose raising the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67.There is broader but still limited support for slicing business tax deductions. Most 56 percent say they back limiting tax deductions for high-income earners as part of a path out of the sequester. Tax reform is often considered a quid pro quo for reining in entitlement spending which is a long-term driver of deficit spending.A Post-ABC News poll last week found broad opposition to the across-the-board cuts to the military that started March 1 with the sequester but there is majority support in the new survey for more targeted defense cuts.Cohen is director of polling for Capital Insight the independent polling group of Washington Post Media.

645,Wave elections are rare. Only a handful of times in the previous century has one party racked up big wins. Democrats won big handfuls of House seats in 1930 1932 1948 1958 1974 2006 and 2008. Republicans won back more than 40 seats in 1938 1942 1946 1966 1994 and 2010. And with nearly a year to go before Election Day voters’ moods can change dramatically.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBut the rocky rollout of the Affordable Care Act and President Obama’s crumbling support suggests another wave might be building. While voters usually punish a president’s party in at least one midterm election they may be winding up to deliver another smack to President Obama’s allies on Capitol Hill.Voter dislike of ObamaCare cost Democrats the House in 2010. It could cost them the Senate in 2014.The poll numbers hint at the toll the Affordable Care Act has taken on the Democratic Party. A CNN/ORC International poll conducted November 18-20 shows 49 percent of registered voters favored a generic Republican candidate for Congress compared with 47 percent who favored a Democratic candidate. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted November 6-11 shows the generic ballot tied at 39 percent each.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementHistorically Democrats have held an advantage of at least a few points on the generic ballot even when election results are a wash: Democrats held a six-point edge just before Election Day 2000 and picked up a grand total of one seat. Democrats led Republicans by one point on the generic ballot just before the 2010 elections when Republicans rode to a sweeping victory.And there’s no sign that Obama will become more popular. Presidents who see their approval ratings dip so dramatically in the second term rarely see their numbers improve. Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon’s approval ratings never recovered after the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal (Nixon of course didn’t stick around to see just how far his ratings could fall). George W. Bush’s approval rating sank in the spring of 2005 and continued falling through the end of his term. Obama’s numbers are starting to resemble Bush’s trend lines.For much of Obama’s tenure even voters who say they disapproved of his job performance still retained a favorable impression of the president. That’s increasingly not the case: In the latest Washington Post/ABC News survey conducted earlier this month Obama’s unfavorable rating 52 percent tops his favorable rating 46 percent. It’s only the second time [pdf] the number of unfavorable impressions outweighed the favorable ones.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementReaction to the bungled rollout of the health care law is overwhelmingly to blame. Already the fallout has been evident: Public surveys in Virginia showed Gov.-elect Terry McAuliffe (D) leading Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli (R) by wide margins in the wake of the government shutdown. But Cuccinelli made the final weeks of the race into a referendum on ObamaCare and McAuliffe’s support began to erode. On Election Day McAuliffe won by just 2.5 points a narrower margin than even his internal polls showed. Another week and Cuccinelli might be governor-elect.Democrats will say the Republican Party is in even worse shape than they are and they have a point: In the October Washington Post/ABC News poll just 32 percent of voters said they had a favorable impression of the GOP compared with 46 percent who had a favorable impression of the Democratic Party. And Republicans still have not articulated a clear governing vision for the country even a year after failure to do so emerged as a central criticism of Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign.But back in 2010 40 percent told Post pollsters they viewed Republicans in a favorable light 10 points lower than those who said they saw Democrats favorably. Republicans feigned a national platform akin to the Contract With America but their pitch to voters was more about what they were against — namely Democrats and ObamaCare — than what they were for. Voters have backed the unpopular party with few ideas over the slightly-more-popular party with unpopular ideas before.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe stakes are highest for Democratic senators seeking re-election in red states where the Affordable Care Act is even more widely despised than it is nationally. Democratic incumbents in Arkansas Louisiana North Carolina and Alaska will face added headwinds unless the political climate changes.And there aren’t many opportunities for Democrats to change that climate.The one opportunity that Democrats do have lies in negotiations over the federal budget. October’s government shutdown gave Democrats a temporary advantage and if Republican hardliners pursue the same path they could hand Democrats an opening. But with Republican anger at Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and others who led the shutdown crusade at such pitched levels it seems unlikely Republicans would repeat their political mistakes of this fall.,1

647,SACRAMENTO — Tony Russo had a multimillion-dollar problem.The Republican consultant and his team had raised piles of cash to use in California politics as last November’s election approached. But a wrinkle in state law meant he couldn’t spend it in the final two months of the campaign without jeopardizing the anonymity he had promised his rich donors.So Russo turned to what he called “the Koch network.” He asked a political consultant who has worked with billionaire Republican contributors Charles and David Koch to shuttle the money through an Arizona nonprofit. That group which is not required to reveal its donors could send cash to California causes without names attached.But things went from bad to worse. Although Russo handed over $25 million only about $15 million ended up back in California. And when the money surfaced it sparked an investigation by state authorities who last month levied $16 million in penalties against the Arizona group and three others.AdvertisementThe case offers a rare glimpse into the shadowy world of politically active nonprofits which have played an increasing role in elections nationwide since the U.S. Supreme Court eased campaign rules in 2010. They provide donors a way to influence elections by piping major money around the country until it resurfaces — without their fingerprints — in a campaign.Advocates of transparency in government call it “dark money.”Russo declined to be interviewed by The Times. But he and his colleagues detailed their experience for California investigators conversations that were recorded in hundreds of pages of transcripts.Those records and other documents released by authorities show a convoluted money trail. They also show the risks of operating in a political world so intricate that even Russo didn’t fully understand how it worked when he threw in his donors’ money.Advertisement“There’s all kinds of groups all over the country that I wouldn’t even know” Russo said.::California Republicans faced two major battles last year: a fight against Gov. Jerry Brown’s tax hike and a push to pass a measure that would limit unions’ political fundraising.Russo did not think the state party was up to the task. He envisioned an independent advertising pitch to voters that would tout economic destruction wrought by tax increases and political havoc caused by powerful California labor unions.AdvertisementTo bring in the big money needed for a statewide television campaign Russo worked with GOP consultant Jeff Miller lead fundraiser for former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and for Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s 2012 presidential campaign. Miller declined to be interviewed by The Times.The Fisher family of the clothing firm Gap Inc. contributed more than $9 million. San Francisco investor Charles Schwab gave $6.4 million and Los Angeles philanthropist Eli Broad sent $1 million.The money went to a Virginia nonprofit that would use it to pay for the ad blitz and be allowed to keep the contributors secret. Nonprofits unlike political action committees are not required to identify their donors under federal law.Many donors did not want to “put their name on … this fight because they didn’t want to face the retribution of the unions” Miller told state investigators. Deep-pocketed labor groups were planning major campaign efforts in 2012 and some conservatives were wary of crossing them.AdvertisementBut by the time the money was pouring in summer was turning into fall. If the donations were spent after early September there was a risk that the veil would have to be lifted on those who wrote the checks in accordance with California’s complex campaign laws.That’s when Russo turned to Republican strategist Sean Noble who has worked as a consultant for the Koch brothers and whom he had met on a trip to Las Vegas the year before.Noble heads the Center to Protect Patient Rights an Arizona nonprofit known as a clearinghouse for conservative causes. In 2010 the organization had distributed more than $55 million to 26 groups allied with Republicans to help them in the midterm elections.Robert Tappan a spokesman for Koch Industries confirmed that Noble has worked for the Koch brothers as a political consultant. Charles and David Koch did not play any role in California campaigns last year Tappan said.AdvertisementNoble declined to speak with investigators according to Gary Winuk enforcement chief at the California Fair Political Practices Commission and he did not answer requests for comment from The Times.Noble had already helped Russo with hundreds of thousands of dollars for political research and focus groups. Now Russo needed a different kind of assistance.He wanted the Virginia group Americans for Job Security to transfer the millions he had raised with Miller to Noble’s center and he wanted Noble to relay the money to California campaign committees obscuring the money trail.There were risks. Russo and Miller would forfeit control of the donations and they knew little about Noble. But donors had recommended him the pair told investigators. And “we were running out of options” Miller said.AdvertisementOn Sept. 10 the Virginia group sent about $4 million to Noble’s Center to Protect Patient Rights. Within a few days the center routed roughly the same sum to an Iowa nonprofit which sent it to a newly created California campaign committee.Russo and Miller then directed $20.5 million more to the center for a total of nearly $25 million.The state documents show that one of the donors working with Russo and Miller whose name was crossed out emailed Charles Koch to ask for his direct assistance.“It would be great if you could support the final effort with several million” the donor wrote adding that “Sean Noble from your group has been immensely helpful” and “I look forward to seeing you on a golf course.”Advertisement::A month before the November election the whole operation came crashing down.At that point Noble had routed about $4 million to a California campaign committee. Russo sent him a text message asking for more cash and $11 million was quickly delivered to the Small Business Action Committee a California PAC fighting higher taxes and supporting the anti-union measure.The money had come from an obscure Phoenix nonprofit Americans for Responsible Leadership which had received it from the Center to Protect Patient Rights.AdvertisementAn $11-million donation attracts immediate attention even in a state as large as California. Americans for Responsible Leadership refused to tell the Fair Political Practices Commission California’s ethics watchdog where the money originated and the agency launched an investigation to determine whether disclosure laws had been violated.That heat created a problem. When Russo next asked Noble to transfer money Noble balked. Expressing concern about the investigation Noble said he didn’t think he could help now Russo told investigators.Miller believed Noble hoped to prevent California authorities “from opening up his books” giving them the keys to an entire network of nonprofits that were distributing money around the country.Russo never pried another dime from Noble. Russo said he and Miller scrambled to raise more cash to make up for the rest of the funds.AdvertisementMiller said he was angry. “But at that point” he said “we were screwed you know because we didn’t have any legal control.”On election day voters passed Brown’s tax-hike plan and rejected the anti-union measure delivering two blows to the Republicans.Late last month state officials announced they were fining the Center to Protect Patient Rights and Americans for Responsible Leadership a total of $1 million for violating California law. The groups should have disclosed that the center was the source of the campaign money but had failed to do so authorities said.The Small Business Action Committee and another California campaign group were ordered to pay the state $15 million equivalent to the amount of money state officials said was improperly reported. The Iowa group that was the conduit for $4 million was not fined because it is more established in California politics Winuk said.AdvertisementRusso sitting in his lawyer’s Sacramento office in July told authorities he still wasn’t sure what happened to the $10 million that never came back to California.chris.megerian@latimes.comanthony.york@latimes.com,0

649,Gallup reports that President Obama’s approval rating slipped again in the 2nd Quarter falling to 47.9%. The dip was the second quarterly drop in a row. At the end of last year on the heels of his reelection Obama’s approval rating stood at 51.9%. His approval rating is near the bottom of second-term Presidents at this point in their tenure.Both Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton had significantly higher approval ratings at this point in their Presidencies. Reagan enjoyed a 58.7% approval rating while Clinton’s approval was slightly lower 56.3%. Gallup notes that Obama’s poll numbers more closely resemble George W. Bush and Harry Truman. Truman’s approval rating was 48.7%. Bush’s was slightly lower than Obama’s at 47.3%.Over the next three months the 19th Quarter in office every modern President has seen a decline in their approval ratings with the exceptions of Reagan and Clinton. Both Presidents were presiding over a strong and growing economy. Obama will be presiding at best over a weak and stagnant economy.Obama faces particular challenges over the next three months however. This Fall Washington will be consumed with another fight over raising the nation’s debt ceiling and passing a budget. The last time Obama and Congress fought over the debt ceiling his approval ratings fell to the lowest of his time in office 41%.Also in October a major piece of his ObamaCare law is scheduled to go into effect the federal and state health insurance exchanges. As with any major government undertaking there are likely going to be problems with the implementation. Massive problems however which are not unlikely could further erode Obama’s approval.Obama’s challenge is that he is in a weak position to absorb those threats to his approval. Just a drop of a few points would put his approval in the low 40s. That is a weak position heading into an important election year when the Democrats are at serious risk of losing control of the Senate.Senate Democrats would likely continue to chart their own course moving themselves away from Obama and the White House. The success or failure of Obama’s second term may be decided this Fall.,1
650,"Jonathan Ellis USA TODAYThune discussed national debt%2C spending and tax reform at town hallSenator defended vote on maintaining tax rates for those making %24400%2C000Congress faces vote in next six weeks to lift debt ceiling beyond %2416.3 trillionSIOUX FALLS S.D. -- Republicans in Congress could take President Barack Obama to court if the president decides to lift the nation's debt limit without congressional approval Sen. John Thune said Wednesday.Thune said the president doesn't have the constitutional authority to lift the debt ceiling even though Democrats in Congress are encouraging the president to try.A divided Congress faces another nasty showdown in the next six weeks to lift the debt ceiling beyond $16.3 trillion. The president this week framed the debate as Congress needing to pay the debts it's incurred. But Thune said the debate also should include spending cuts to address the reasons why the nation has the debt and he said past spending reforms have been tied to the debt ceiling.""I don't know when it happens but this thing is going to blow up on us if we don't do something"" Thune said of the debt.Thune made his comments at a town hall meeting Wednesday that focused on the national debt spending and tax reform.The only way to address the national debt in a substantial way is to make reforms to entitlement programs including Social Security Medicare and Medicaid Thune said. Solutions to Medicare include phasing in age adjustments so that younger people wouldn't be eligible to join the program until later in age and to require wealthier Medicare recipients pay into the systems in order to get benefits.The senator defended his New Year's Eve vote on a package that left taxes on income rates in place for all but those making $400000 or more a year or couples making $450000. The measure also locked into place exemptions on estate taxes which Thune said was important for farmers and ranchers who worried a large estate tax meant the loss of the family farm.Conservatives however criticized the package because it didn't include spending cuts to government programs. When asked why he voted for the measure Thune said he did it to keep taxes low for 99 percent of Americans.""There's been a lot of criticism and I understand that"" Thune said. ""There are things in there I absolutely hated.""Several people at the town hall expressed frustrations about Republicans in Congress being unable to get their messages out and to effectively block the Obama administration and Senate Democrats.""I'm concerned for our country and I just feel like we're losing it every day"" said Jim Holiway of Sioux Falls. Holiway asked Thune what actions he would take to prevent the federal government from becoming more centralized.Later following the town hall Holiway said he wished Republican elected officials would make speeches and take to the airwaves the way Democrats did when they were in the minority.""When they were in the minority they would holler to high heaven"" Holiway said.Politicians have become more reluctant to hold town halls for fear angry voters will confront them and the exchanges will be used in campaign commercials. Thune is the only member of the South Dakota delegation who consistently holds town halls.At least one Democrat former state lawmaker Darrell Solberg asked Thune to clarify whether Medicare and Social Security were separate funds and their relations to the national debt.Democrat Tom Cool said Republican presidents Reagan and Bush tripled the national debt but Republicans didn't worry about it then. Cool said the debt won't be brought under control by Republicans in the House refusing to extend the debt ceiling.""I don't know how elephants can have such poor memories"" Cool said.Ellis also reports for The (Sioux Falls S.D.)

651,President Obama has nominated one of the nation’s best lawyers Mary Jo White to be the next chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.Ms. White has a formidable record as a prosecutor from 1993 to 2002 when she was the United States attorney in the Southern District of New York. She also has a stellar reputation as a white-collar defense attorney at Debevoise & Plimpton where she has been chief of litigation since 2002 representing several of the firms and executives that she would regulate at the S.E.C.Her résumé in the past decade has understandably alarmed advocates of financial reform who fear that her work as a defender of Wall Street means that she is dangerously biased in favor of the banks and their deregulatory agenda. Her lack of a deep regulatory background is also a worry at a time when the agency’s top priority is to finish overdue rules to carry out the Dodd-Frank financial reform and other securities laws. Complicating matters further her husband John White is also a corporate lawyer at Cravath Swaine & Moore with his own long list of Wall Street clients.We understand these concerns but do not believe they are disqualifying. Ms. White is a worthy nominee though clearly the White House and Ms. White will have to address the conflicts of interest in her background frankly and persuasively. Equally important she must be able to demonstrate in her confirmation hearing that she is not captive to the financial industry’s view of the world which has dominated her recent professional life.,0
652,WASHINGTONTHE graying man flashing fury in the Rose Garden on behalf of the Newtown families the grieving man wiping away tears after speaking at the Boston memorial service is not the same man who glided into office four years ago.President Obama has watched the blood-dimmed tide drowning the ceremony of innocence as Yeats wrote and he has learned how to emotionally connect with Americans in searing moments as he did from the White House late Friday night after the second bombing suspect was apprehended in Boston.Unfortunately he still has not learned how to govern.How is it that the president won the argument on gun safety with the public and lost the vote in the Senate? It’s because he doesn’t know how to work the system. And it’s clear now that he doesn’t want to learn or to even hire some clever people who can tell him how to do it or do it for him.It’s unbelievable that with 90 percent of Americans on his side he could get only 54 votes in the Senate. It was a glaring example of his weakness in using leverage to get what he wants. No one on Capitol Hill is scared of him.,1
653,Last November President Obama won a narrow reelection and the Democrats in the Senate added two seats to their caucus. A few high-profile Republicans lost their races. The outcome has prompted the usual round of hand-wringing from the media pundits and national GOP Leaders about the future of the party. A deeper look at the election results however paints a more complicated picture. Democrats may want to conduct their own hand-wringing about the future of their party.Although it lost the Presidency the Republicans picked up a large number of victories in November. They gained a Governorship and solidified their gains from 2010 in the House and in the states. The GOP now has 30 Governors a record in modern political history. They control all levers of state government in 25 states. One would have to go back to the 1920s to find the GOP so ascendant in the states. The Democrats have complete control in just 12 states an historic low. (The rest of the states have split control.)GOP strength in the states isn’t confined just to the South or the Plains. They control the Governor and Legislature in industrial heartland states like Pennsylvania Ohio Michigan and Indiana as well. While Governor’s races in these states will always be competitive redistricting should ensure that the GOP will dominate the legislatures in these states for the next decade.This isn’t just a numbers game. The polarization in the states gives each party an opportunity to enact large parts of their respective agendas. Republicans in several states are embracing this chance. Several states are looking at comprehensive overhauls of their tax codes. Republicans are looking at reforms throughout state government from the budget education and business regulation.Democrats meanwhile made strong gains in the states where they hold control. The party won a supermajority in the California and Illinois legislatures for example. Progressives in these states will feel emboldened to pursue their agenda of higher taxes on the wealthy and business and increased social spending. In many places they will pursue stricter gun control and new environmental regulations.The public is about to benefit from a real-time experiment in whose policies are better suited to encourage economic growth. The likely Democrat lurch to the left in several states could tarnish the party’s brand in large parts of the country. Successful Republican governance in the states by contrast could repair some of the damage done to the GOP’s brand in national politics.The national GOP does face challenges. National party leaders are engaged in an existential crisis over the right amount of “conservative” or “moderate” positions. They seem largely disengaged from the party’s base supporters and activists.That said Democrats are on a path to disengage them from large segments of the public. Combining this with the national Dem push to raise taxes and enact gun control among other issues will make it difficult for Democrats to remain competitive in large parts of the country. This will create an enormous opportunity for the national GOP to fix its brand.It shouldn’t look to machinations on Capitol Hill for salvation. It should look to the states.Follow me on twitter,1
654,Conservative behavior since President Obama’s reelection in November has evoked at least in me a keen sense of sadness. Hardly a day goes by without weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth by the likes of Rush Limbaugh on talk radio and Sean Hannity on Fox News over Obama’s return to the White House. Similar whining is heard among Republicans on Capitol Hill.Simply put conservatives are in agony over the president’s smashing victory. Their pain is hard to watch. Only small-minded Democrats would gloat.What we’re seeing is the impact of losing when you believed with all your heart soul and mind buttressed by the predictions of pollsters and pundits that you would win handily.The reaction is for me heart-rending.Consider the feeble attempt by House Republicans to recover political ground by threatening Obama over the debt limit.The poor things crazed by their defeat didn’t realize that they had no leverage. They had to back down with a face-saving gimmick to suspend through May enforcement of the limit on federal borrowing.Consider some Republicans’ return to the issue of what happened in Benghazi Libya. Did they really think that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would traipse up to the Hill this week prostrate herself before Congress and confess to something that she knew wasn’t true?They so wanted her to say that there was mendacity and attempts by the administration to cover up malfeasance in the Sept. 11 attack on a U.S. diplomatic facility. Some seemed truly distressed that Clinton wouldn’t give them what they wanted. They were so desperate. It was so sad.And so it has gone since election night. The lamentations abound:●Obama’s nominations of Jack Lew as Treasury secretary and Chuck Hagel as defense secretary are confrontational; woe unto us.●“I would have liked to have seen some outreach” in Obama’s inaugural address complained Sen. John McCain who with his Republican cohorts did everything they could to kick Barack Obama out of the White House.●The Obama administration will “attempt to annihilate the Republican Party . . . to just shove us into the dustbin of history” House Speaker John Boehner wailed this week.And so it goes: one big conservative pity party.Imagine how hard it must have been to lose.For four long years they hit Obama with everything they had assailing him at every turn. No insult was too offensive to be hurled; no abuse too outrageous to be tried; no name too abusive to call.From Day One destruction of the Obama administration and preventing his reelection was top priority; the second item too far down the list to remember.Four years of blame blame blame. Blah blah blah.Conservatives on Capitol Hill and right-wing commentators left nothing on the field.They gave it their all — and came up empty.What an emotional letdown. How not to feel at least a little sorry for them?So where do they go from here?This should be a time for introspection for conservatives to examine their thoughts and look inside for answers as to why they lost when at first blush they had so much going for them. And why were they so dead set on not just defeating but breaking this president?Hard-liners of course will take exception to my characterization of their behavior. What I might call abusive or mean they would probably describe as passionate: their passionate defense of liberty the Constitution smaller government free enterprise and the individual — all things they see Obama as opposing.The conservative wing regards itself as all that stands between freedom and tyranny between order and chaos between values and licentiousness.And perhaps that self-view explains why they are taking their loss so hard.It also may help explain why their conduct is so well touching.Conservatives yakking it up in House and Senate chambers and on the airwaves these days are delusional in much the way that the South deluded itself into thinking it was in the right during the Civil War or that Republicans held fast to the misguided belief that the presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt was wrong for the country.American principles endure. But America is changing just as it evolved during the Lincoln era and just as it emerged from the Great Depression under FDR’s leadership.What makes this so excruciatingly sad is that some forces on the right are too far gone to see the truth.Read more from Colbert King’s archive.,0
655,WASHINGTON — Legislation to fund the government cleared the Senate on Friday but moved to the House where infighting among the Republican majority left little time for Congress to act before a midnight Monday deadline to avert a shutdown of many government programs.House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) left the Capitol after a midmorning meeting with his leadership team failed to reach consensus on an approach. He plans to assemble Republicans again at noon Saturday.AdvertisementThe Democrats who control the Senate easily beat back a GOP strategy led by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) that aimed to tie the government funding bill to a measure that would have blocked President Obama’s healthcare law. More than half of the Republican senators joined the Democrats in rejecting Cruz’s hard-line approach.But Cruz and his conservative Republican allies in the House have refused to relinquish the fight. The senator met privately with tea party lawmakers in the House this week complicating Boehner’s efforts to unite his restive majority around a strategy.AdvertisementAs the speaker and his leadership team tried to devise an endgame federal agencies began notifying employees about whether they would be furloughed in the event of a shutdown and prepared to shutter the popular Smithsonian museums close national parks and halt many basic government services.Obama in a late-afternoon appearance in the White House briefing room warned Republicans not to “threaten to burn the house down simply because you haven’t gotten 100% of your way.”Advertisement“My message to Congress is this: Do not shut down the government. Do not shut down the economy” he said. “Pass a budget on time. Pay our bills on time. Refocus on the everyday concerns of the American people.”The president cast the GOP effort as “political grandstanding” and said he would not buckle. “The House Republicans are so concerned with appeasing the tea party that they’ve threatened a government shutdown or worse unless I gut or repeal the Affordable Care Act” Obama said. “That’s not going to happen.”AdvertisementTea party Republicans see the threat of a shutdown as their best chance to stop the Affordable Care Act before Tuesday when the online marketplaces to buy health insurance under the new law are set to open. But the president said Friday that the marketplaces would open on time even if there is a shutdown. “That’s a done deal” he said.Many Republican strategists have warned that voters will blame their party for a shutdown noting that happened the last time government offices were shuttered in 1995 and 1996. But many conservative lawmakers were not in Congress then and have rejected such warnings saying polls show Americans do not support Obamacare.AdvertisementRepublicans meanwhile sought to blame Obama for the standoff.“The House will take action that reflects the fundamental fact that Americans don’t want a government shutdown and they don’t want the train wreck that is Obamacare” said Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck. “Grandstanding from the president who refuses to even be a part of the process won’t bring Congress any closer to a resolution.”AdvertisementThe deep GOP divisions spilled into the open this week as Cruz rankled fellow Republicans with his attention-getting 21-hour-plus Senate speech promoting what many colleagues view as a doomed strategy.Cruz and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) met Thursday with some of the most conservative House Republicans for a dinner that lasted late into the evening. The senators encouraged their colleagues to stand firm against any funding bill that does not fully delay the healthcare law.Advertisement“I am hopeful; I am confident that the House will continue to stand its ground continue to listen to the American people and step up to respond and to stop this train wreck — this nightmare that is Obamacare” Cruz said after the Senate votes that sent the bill back to the House without the provision to cut money for the healthcare program.At the same time the U.S. Chamber of Commerce which is influential among Republicans urged Congress in a letter also signed by 235 other groups not to shut down the government or default on the debt. The debt limit must be raised by Oct. 17 for the nation to continue paying its bills and avoid a default.AdvertisementThe party’s former standard-bearer presidential candidate Mitt Romney also warned against the strategy. “The tactic of using a government shutdown to try and push that will be counterproductive politically” he said in an interview on CNN’s “The Lead with Jake Tapper.” “I don’t think that will be as effective.”House Republicans plan to discuss several proposals Saturday that would tie a new Obamacare rollback provision to the funding bill. That could prolong the standoff with the Senate and lead to a legislative pingpong that could take days to resolve all but ensuring that the government would shut down.AdvertisementThe hard-right flank is pushing for a one-year delay of the healthcare law. The proposal by Rep. Tom Graves (R-Ga.) is supported by more than 60 other House Republicans and if they hold firm they could deny Boehner the majority he needs to pass a less restrictive measure.Other Republicans have suggested delaying the mandate that individuals must carry health insurance by 2014 or face a fine.AdvertisementSome have also suggested more modest measures including one to repeal a tax on medical-device manufacturers and another to prevent members of Congress and staff from receiving federal funding toward their health insurance — a hit to lawmakers’ pocketbooks that members of Congress oppose.Boehner may see no option but to try again to cut back Obamacare but the strategy of tacking other healthcare provisions onto the funding bill appears doomed to fail. Democrats in the Senate are united in their pledge to protect the healthcare law. No Democratic senators voted Friday to end funding for the program.AdvertisementSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) who has taken to calling House Republicans “anarchists” dismissed the tea party flank as the “weird caucus.”“Any bill that continues to play political games will force a government shutdown” he said. “To be absolutely clear: We are going to accept nothing as it relates to Obamacare.”AdvertisementAlternatively Boehner could seek support from Democrats to approve a funding bill without any healthcare provisions but he has been reluctant to do that for fear of upsetting his conservative majority.That Cruz has continued to pursue his strategy despite its failure in the Senate pointed to the sway of tea-party-aligned organizations that have supported the renegade Republican over the elected party leadership.Advertisement“It says more about the Republican leadership than it says about Cruz” said Chris Chocola a former Indiana congressman who is president of the Club for Growth a free-market group influential among Republicans. “They leave this huge void for someone to come up with an idea and provide leadership and they don’t like it when someone does.”lisa.mascaro@latimes.comAdvertisementmichael.memoli@latimes.com,0

657,"Republican activists are taking solace in success stories by governors and legislatures in GOP-leaning states as their party tries to regroup after the disappointments of a bruising presidential contest and a stalled agenda in Washington.Here's what fired up Washington-weary GOP stalwarts at a weekend conference of conservatives in this perennial swing state: pension overhauls in Wisconsin tax cuts in Indiana and labor losses in Michigan.Some of the biggest applause was reserved for governors who did not attend the event. The mere mention of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker a tea-party favorite who won national attention for his battles with organized labor prompted thunderous cheers. That was despite a speaking card full of potential presidential hopefuls including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.Several GOP contenders including Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal used their appearances at the Americans for Prosperity summit to position themselves as Washington outsiders. While that strategy is hardly new the appeals play to a Republican base starved for the kind of victories that gridlocked Washington has been unable to deliver.""All roads lead back to the states"" Perry said as more than 1000 activists roared their approval Friday. ""I don't think the American people want to look to Washington D.C. to solve the problems of the day. Washington D.C. is creating the problems of the day.""That set up an interesting dynamic as Rubio was heckled for his support of immigration reform his signature legislative issue. Attendees repeatedly interrupted him with cries of ""No amnesty!""The anti-Washington mood is likely to harden this fall as Congress faces deadlines to pass a budget or face a government shutdown. This week Republicans negotiating with the White House said there was ""no common ground"" with the Obama administration which wants to couple spending cuts with tax increases.Both sides are bracing for a confrontation.Immigration overhaul legislation is also in limbo after the Democratic-led Senate passed a far-reaching bill that includes a path to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants already in the country illegally. A majority of House Republicans remain opposed to such a provision creating a potentially unbridgeable divide.""It's not working from the top down obviously"" said Andre Adamski a 47-year-old engineer from Lawrenceville Ga.On Friday he was headed to a workshop on local tax overhauls while his wife Mary was primed for a social media boot camp. Self-described tea party activists who volunteered for Mitt Romney's campaign both said they were refocusing their efforts on state politics.The conference hall was filled with patriotic garb and anti-Obama memorabilia including a book entitled ""The Ultimate Obama Survival Guide."" Some attendees said they were slowly returning to politics after the sting of last year's presidential loss.""I didn't turn a TV on for months"" said Greg Gormley a 49-year-old sales director from Charleston S.C. ""This is my way to man up and see what I can do whatever that is.""The weekend conference sponsored by Americans for Prosperity was aimed in part at motivating the advocacy group's foot soldiers at a growing number of state affiliates which have played prominent roles in tax education and gun-control debates across the country. Backed by the billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch the group spent $190 million on conservative causes in the past election cycle.""I know things are difficult in D.C."" Tim Phillips the group's president told activists. ""It can get frustrating you can get down and depressed sometimes. But I tell you do what we do -- get the heck out of Washington and get out to states.""Indeed much of the summit's panels focused on grassroots organizing and local action.At a session on President Barack Obama's health care law panelists dismissed Washington-led efforts by Rubio and others to defund ""Obamacare"" and instead urged activists to fight at the state level to oppose one of the law's key provisions: expanding Medicaid the federal and state program for poor people.""The Medicaid fight is where we can make a difference"" said Avik Roy of the conservative Manhattan Institute.Nearly half the states have opted out of the expansion and organizers urged activists to keep pressure on GOP leaders including Ohio Gov. John Kasich who was elected in 2010 with tea party support but now favors expanding Medicaid.When speakers addressed Washington they used it as symbol of government run amok. Rubio won a standing ovation for his pledge to vote against a budget that includes funding for the federal health care law. ""Big government is doing what it has always done: It is failing"" he said to cheers.Jindal said he was ""angry this government is using its power -- the IRS the NSA the Department of Justice -- to go after innocent law abiding Americans."" He brought the crowd to its feet with the declaration that ""there is a rebellion brewing in these states.""Still for now conference organizers told activists to take solace in local victories.""We're going to take back Washington too"" Phillips said ""we're just going to need a little more time.""",1
658,"Sen. Robert Menendez sponsored legislation with incentives for natural gas vehicle conversions that would benefit the biggest political donor to his re-election the same eye doctor whose private jet Menendez used for two personal trips to the Dominican Republic an Associated Press investigation found.The disclosure reflects the latest intersection between the New Jersey Democrat who is the subject of an ethics inquiry on Capitol Hill and the Florida doctor involved in a federal criminal investigation.Dr. Salomon Melgen invested in Gaseous Fuel Systems Corp. of Weston Fla. and joined its board of directors in early 2010 according to the company's chief executive and a former company consultant. GFS as the company is known designs manufactures and sells products to convert diesel-fuel fleets to natural gas. The amount of Melgen's investment is confidential under rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission but a 2009 document filed with the SEC showed the company required a minimum individual investment at that time of $51500.At the same time Menendez emerged as a principal supporter of a natural gas bill that would boost tax credits and grants to truck and heavy vehicle fleets that converted to alternative fuels. The bill stalled in the Senate Finance Committee and after it was revived in 2012 the NAT GAS Act failed to win the needed 60 votes to pass.While the bill was under consideration between 2009 and 2011 the former consultant for GFS spent $220000 lobbying Menendez's staff and other congressional and federal officials on the act's provisions as well as other regulatory issues according to interviews and Senate records.There is no evidence that Menendez offered direct help or intervened on behalf of the company or Melgen. Instead the connection between the two men's interests in natural gas is the latest example of the close symmetry between the senator — who recently rose to become chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee — and his millionaire backer. It illustrates the way Menendez's political clout has at times overlapped with Melgen's financial investments.In recent weeks Menendez has acknowledged other dealings with Melgen. Menendez was compelled to reimburse $58000 for two flights aboard Melgen's private jet that he had previously failed to report prompting scrutiny by the Senate Ethics Committee. Menendez also acknowledged that his office had contacted U.S. health agencies in 2009 and 2012 to question their billing practices and policies amid a dispute between Melgen an eye specialist and federal health authorities. FBI agents in January searched Melgen's offices in Florida and seized files as part of a criminal investigation.Menendez also raised concerns last year with State and Commerce Department officials about the Dominican Republic's reluctance to enforce a port security contract with a company that Melgen partly owns.A spokeswoman for Menendez Patricia Enright told the AP that the senator supported the natural gas bill to help improve the environment. She said Menendez personally had no known discussions with either Melgen or others associated with GFS concerning the legislation or its impact on the company. She said it was unclear whether the senator will continue to support the bill he had sponsored.Melgen's attorney in Miami Kirk Ogrosky told the AP in a statement that ""Dr. Melgen has never discussed his involvement with Gaseous Fuel Systems Corp. with either Sen. Menendez or his staff.""An SEC document filed last week by GFS showed that Melgen remains on the company's board of directors. An earlier document filed by the firm in May 2011 was the first to show Melgen as a director. That SEC record showed a $6 million investment in the firm from two unnamed individuals.The company's top executive Ken Green said Melgen is a key investor but has had no influence on the company's decision-making and has not attended any director's meetings since he joined the firm.""Dr. Melgen hasn't ever been to our offices not once"" Green told the AP. ""He's a passive investor.""Green said the Senate bill that Menendez supported would provide only limited help to his company because most of its provisions are aimed at heavy on-road vehicles like truck rigs and bus fleets. GFS has pioneered an engine conversion system that can be installed on diesel-fueled vehicles but Green said it is marketed exclusively for off-road equipment such as massive mining trucks. The tax credits proposed by the bill would do little to offset the cost to buyers of the off-road trucks which can cost as much as $8 million Green said.""This bill won't do much of anything for us"" he said.But in 2010 when Melgen first invested in GFS the firm was actively considering marketing its natural gas engine devices for on-road vehicles. The bill both in its 2009 and 2012 versions authorized changes to IRS rules allowing larger tax credits for on-road natural gas-supplied trucks and vehicles as well as grants for research. The proposal also urged the Environmental Protection Agency to streamline rules covering the conversion of diesel and gas engines to natural gas and alternative fuels.GFS said in October 2010 in a press release that its strategy ""integrates four related areas of business development"" including ""on-road coal truck conversions."" The release written by the company's consultant and then-director of strategic projects Elio Muller also said that ""a vast number of on-road 18-wheeler tractor-trailer trucks hauling coal"" in the Appalachian region of Kentucky and West Virginia could be converted to combination diesel-natural gas engines with the GFS system.Muller a former Commerce Department official in the Clinton administration involved in several Tampa businesses said last week that he introduced Melgen to Green and other GFS officials in early 2010. Green also said Muller was instrumental in bringing the company to Melgen's attention. Muller said he has known Melgen from Florida's Democratic political circles dating back to the late 1990s. At one point Muller drew up plans to start a business Melgen & Muller Inc. but the men never followed through.Melgen has made investments in health-related companies since the 1990s according to SEC reports but his GFS stake is his only evident natural gas-related investment. Green said he met several times with Melgen and found him to be an ""intelligent investor"" but could not explain his sudden interest in natural gas.""I don't know how he found out about natural gas but he liked what we were doing and thought it was innovative"" Green said.By early 2010 when Melgen formally joined GFS Menendez had already taken on a key role in backing the natural gas bill joining Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada and Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah as out-front sponsors.The NAT GAS Act quickly drew energy and environmental battle lines. Oil and alternative energy magnate T. Boone Pickens led corporate natural gas industry backers of the bill aided by the Obama administration and influential environmental groups. Arrayed against the bill were top oil and coal firms and even some green activists joined by industrialists David and Charles Koch whose political action group Americans for Prosperity harnessed opposition from conservative groups.Green said he did not authorize or hire any lobbyists on behalf of GFS because he was skeptical about broadening into the markets for on-road trucks. But he did not block the activities of Muller who in addition to his consulting role with GFS had also started his own firm Diesel 2 Gas. It aimed to license GFS technology and use the firm's parts to outfit on-road trucks.In June 2010 representing both GFS and Diesel 2 Gas Muller testified before an EPA panel in Ann Arbor Mich. about what he called ""cumbersome and unnecessary"" rules that hurt GFS and other natural gas firms. The EPA agreed to alter its regulations in April 2011.Between 2009 and 2011 Muller also ran an independent consulting firm Muller Group Inc. which paid $220000 to lobbyists from Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck LLP to lobby for the NAT GAS Act and related issues.Muller said he accompanied the lobbyists in at least one meeting with Menendez' staff about the bill but could not recall details. Melgen and Muller joined Menendez at a signing ceremony in Miami in January 2010 for the senator's book ""Growing American Roots."" And last June they joined Menendez at the annual U.S.-Spain Council Annual Forum in Jersey City.Muller said he did not discuss his lobbying activities with Melgen even though they were both involved with GFS.Both Muller and Melgen also have fundraising ties to Menendez. Muller gave $5000 to Menendez' New Jersey Senate re-election campaign in 2011. Melgen has been a staunch supporter giving more than $14000 directly to Menendez since the late 1990s and through his eye clinic donating $700000 last year to a ""super"" political committee that supported Democratic Senate candidates. The committee in turn spent $582000 to back Menendez' campaign.",0

660,RICHMOND Va. — Ken Cuccinelli is running for governor not Congress but the Virginia Republican is struggling to dodge the political fallout from Capitol Hill.His campaign in this crucial battleground state is in danger of becoming the first political casualty of the federal government shutdown which Americans largely blame on Republicans.AdvertisementWith the election just weeks away Cuccinelli’s poll numbers have tumbled since federal agencies were closed Oct. 1. The conservative state attorney general was already lagging but he went from within striking distance of a vulnerable Democrat to trailing by 8 to 10 percentage points in three independent polls.As the candidate a tea party favorite seeks to distance himself from fellow activists in Congress national Republican leaders are worried that a key office they expected to hold in a closely watched election is slipping away.AdvertisementThey also fear the shutdown could tarnish the party’s brand ahead of next year’s midterm election.Not all Republican candidates are suffering because of the shutdown. In Democratic New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie a GOP nonconformist is positioned to cruise to reelection.AdvertisementChristie is conservative but he has not allied himself with the tea party. Instead he has focused on issues that most concern voters such as the runaway costs of public employee benefits and he is moving ahead with President Obama’s healthcare law. The New Jersey governor shows little regard for how his policies affect score cards with activists on the right.“Republicans should think about these things as they ponder who to support in 2016” said strategist Steve Schmidt who ran Arizona Sen. John McCain’s presidential campaign in 2008. Schmidt sees the Virginia race as a cautionary tale for the party. “You have a campaign that has been unable to transcend its ideological baggage running against someone who would have been beatable with almost any other conceivable candidate.”AdvertisementCuccinelli also has the misfortune to be running in the state with the most federal workers. Analysts say the uneasiness many voters had with Cuccinelli’s tea party brand of Republicanism has solidified into outright opposition.“The shutdown is hurting Cuccinelli” said Quentin Kidd a professor of political science at Christopher Newport University in Newport News Va. For voters on the fence he said “it helped them make a decision. They thought ‘If that is the kind of thing we’d be looking at with Ken Cuccinelli then I am not interested.’”AdvertisementEstablishment Republicans are frustrated. The Democratic nominee Terry McAuliffe is a former chairman of the national party and is saddled with baggage.His business dealings have long attracted unflattering media attention including allegations that he cashed in on his Clinton-era political connections to grow his personal fortune. At the Democratic National Committee his fundraising tactics pushed ethical boundaries. He’s been compared to a carnival barker and a used car salesman.AdvertisementBut in a part of the country that has drifted from solidly red to solidly purple polls suggest the statewide electorate would sooner vote for a candidate who may strike them as smarmy than one allied with the Republican Party’s most extreme politicians.“I don’t like McAuliffe but I really don’t like Cuccinelli” said Cindy Freese 59 a retired reinsurance executive in Alexandria who is registered as an independent. Her husband is a federal employee poised to miss his mid-month paycheck. Freese said she would “absolutely” vote for a moderate Republican for governor “but there aren’t any anymore.”AdvertisementVirginia’s electoral landscape like that of the country overall has shifted amid an influx of immigrants and the growth of diverse suburbs. In last year’s presidential election the Obama campaign used those changing demographics to its advantage microtargeting voters with messaging that appealed to them. McAuliffe has recruited some of the data whizzes and strategists behind that effort to replicate it in Virginia.The Cuccinelli campaign represents the traditional approach. The candidate is the kind of firebrand conservative whom party activists believe energizes voters in the style of Ronald Reagan. As attorney general he fought to block Obama’s healthcare law. A climate change skeptic he started an investigation into a University of Virginia scientist whose research warned of a rise in temperatures. He has condemned homosexuality and sought to reinstate anti-sodomy laws rejected by the courts.AdvertisementThat record is not playing well with many Virginians uneasy with the rigid ideologies at the root of the shutdown. At a University of Richmond forum last week Cuccinelli avoided much of it.He lamented the refusal to compromise in Congress saying he opposes the shutdown. He said Republicans failed the country on healthcare by not doing anything to fix a broken system when they controlled the White House and Congress. Asked to name the biggest social policy on his agenda Cuccinelli responded “That isn’t what I am running on.”AdvertisementMcAuliffe reminded the audience that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) a current tea party favorite had just campaigned in Virginia for Cuccinelli. “The architect of the shutdown was here last week” McAuliffe said. “He and Ken Cuccinelli went to an event together. I wouldn’t have even been in the same room with Ted Cruz with all the damage he has done.”To be sure Cuccinelli’s stumble began before the shutdown. Federal investigators are looking into a business executive’s connections to Gov. Bob McDonnell and the inquiry has tainted the state party. Cuccinelli’s attacks on McAuliffe’s ethics were blunted when it came out that he had accepted $18000 in gifts from the businessman.AdvertisementBut it was only after federal employees were told not to report to work that McAuliffe nearly doubled his lead in the polls.“What has happened here reflects the challenges the GOP faces nationally” Virginia Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling said.AdvertisementA moderate Republican Bolling opted not to run for governor when the party decided to choose its candidate with a convention not an election at the behest of activists seeking to ensure the nominee would be loyal to the base.“Now” he said “Democrats have been able to use the shutdown to remind mainstream Virginia voters about what their concerns are: Would Ken Cuccinelli be able to govern in a mainstream way? Or would he govern the state in the style you are seeing in D.C.?”Advertisementevan.halper@latimes.com,0
661,Republicans are supposed to be the party of business. So why in an exclusive survey of fast-growth CEOs do 36 percent of these entrepreneurs say they’d support Hillary Clinton for President? That's more than any other potential Presidential candidate except for New Jersey Governor Chris Christie whom 47 percent of survey respondents said they would support.The findings are based on a survey of the Inc. 5000 our annual ranking of the fastest-growing private U.S. companies.Some of the other contenders were Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin with 34 percent; former Florida Governor Jeb Bush with 31 percent; and Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky with 21 percent. After Clinton the best-scoring Democrat was New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. Nine percent of fast-growth entrepreneurs said they’d support him.Strange BedfellowsThe conventional wisdom is that two-thirds of business owners are Republican and one-third are Democrats. That’s misleading. In the Inc. survey 47 percent of fast-growth CEOs describe themselves as Republicans compared to only 17 percent who say they’re Democrats. But more than a third--36 percent--say they’re independents.When asked about their political philosophy as opposed to party affiliation the results are telling. Only 31 percent say they’re conservative. Liberals are an even smaller minority at only 10 percent. Everyone else--a whopping 59 percent--claims to be moderate.Women CEOs not surprisingly are even less likely to be Republican. About a third of fast-growth women entrepreneurs said they are Republicans a third said they are Democrats and about a third are independents. While about two-thirds of fast-growth CEOs who are men voted for Republican candidate Mitt Romney in the last U.S. presidential election more than half the women--53 percent--voted for Barack Obama.The fact that so many of the Inc. 5000 consider themselves moderates doesn’t leave a whole lot of room for candidates on either edge of the political spectrum be they Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts (6.3 percent) or Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas (15 percent). But it leaves plenty of business owners who are willing to back a Democratic woman for President--especially one whose bridge-building efforts have won praise from both sides of the political aisle and who is widely regarded as having had a successful tenure as the U.S. Secretary of State. Forty percent of fast-growth CEOs who said they were independents also said they’d back Clinton. Eighty-seven percent of Democrats said they’d support her as did 13 percent of Republicans. Among women 61 percent said they’d back Clinton for President.It’s telling that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie a Republican who got flak from his own party by appearing to buddy up with President Obama just a bit too much during Hurricane Sandy last year was the only one to make a stronger showing than Hillary. More than half of independents--53 percent--said they’d back Christie for president.It undoubtedly helps both Christie and Clinton that neither of them is currently serving in Washington. When it comes to the federal government shutdown the threatened debt default and the record-breaking level of dysfunction in D.C. their hands are clean. For now.Based on the results of an October survey of Inc. 5000 entrepreneurs. The survey had 306 respondents.,1
662,A Republican in California won a state Senate seat on Wednesday in a District in which Democrats have a 22-point advantage and that is 60% Hispanic.Andy Vidak the Republican farmer won the special election runoff for the 16th District Senate seat when his opponent Democrat Leticia Perez a Kern County Supervisor conceded on Wednesday a day after voters cast their ballots. Vidak had 54% of the vote to Perez’s 46%.Perez had initially conceded two months ago when the special election was held. But a recount put Vidak under the 50% threshold that was needed to avoid a runoff and Perez took back her concession nearly a week after the initial election. The seat became vacant when the Democrat who won the seat in 2010 by 21 points resigned to work for Chevron. Democrats thought especially with a Hispanic female candidate the seat would be a shoo-in for them. The veto-proof supermajority Democrats have in the state Senate is now imperiled with Vidak’s victory.As Breitbart News had previously reported though “Vidak a working class candidate resonated with working class Hispanics in the district who also saw how coastal California elites were not putting their bread-and-butter interests first.”Vidak ran broadly on “the bifurcation of California: the coastal liberal elites versus the Valley folks.” On a more local level Vidak’s theme of “fish versus farmer” resonated with Democrats in a District where the unemployment rate is 15% and as high as 30% in some communities in the District. Vidak reminded voters that liberal environmentalists in order to protect fish only allowed farmers to receive 20% of their water allocation crippling the region’s economy. He also stressed that Perez supported the the state’s high-speed rail project that would have razed business farms and homes in the District. Because she supported the agenda of coastal elites and Democrat interest groups Perez was able to raise twice as much money as Vidak but 16th District voters ultimately rejected her liberal policies.It is often said that California is a harbinger of things to come for the country. For Republicans looking at California there has not been much of hope of late but Vidak’s victory could be a sign that areas that have traditionally voted for Democrats may give the right kind of Republican a chance as they see unemployment rates increase and opportunities for upward mobility decrease in their communities.,1
663,I KNOW governor I know: It’s still too early for presidential speculation you’re just focused on the job at hand and any talk of 2016 while flattering is purely hypothetical.But just in case you do have some faint slight extremely modest interest in parlaying your landslide re-election into a presidential bid here are four 2016 “don’ts” to keep in mind:Don’t be Jon Huntsman. This sounds easy enough but obvious pitfalls are still worth pointing out. For the next two years you’re going to be hailed up and down the Acela Corridor as the Great Moderate Hope the anti-Tea Party candidate the Man Who Is Not Ted Cruz. But you can’t actively embrace that part or give off the impression — as Huntsman did obviously and fatally — that you agree with the media that your party’s full of rubes and cranks.As a would-be nominee you have to woo base voters not run against them and make them feel respected even when they disagree with you. This doesn’t mean muzzling yourself or pandering to every right-wing interest group. But it means persuading conservatives that you like them that you understand them and that as president you’re going to be (mostly) on their side.Don’t be Rudy Giuliani. You probably think you wouldn’t have Rudy’s problems in a Republican primary. Yes you’re both combative Northeasterners from the party’s moderate flank but unlike the former mayor you aren’t a social liberal with a public history of adultery (and a few drag performances thrown in).,0
664,"This morning CNN had only released some of the results of their poll. Now they've released the second part and boy it's a doozy for the GOP.In a sign of the political hangover congressional Republicans are suffering in the wake of the government shutdown three-quarters of Americans in a new national poll say that most GOP members of Congress don't deserve to be re-elected. A CNN/ORC International survey released Monday also found a majority saying that the Republicans' policies are too extreme. And according to the poll Democrats have an 8-point advantage over the Republicans in an early indicator in the battle for control of Congress. But with more than a year to go until the 2014 midterm elections there's plenty of time for these numbers to change. .... More than seven in 10 questioned in the survey said that most members of Congress don't deserve to be re-elected with nearly four in 10 saying even their own representative doesn't deserve a return ticket to Washington next year. Both figures are hovering around all-time highs in CNN polling. ""Although incumbent members of Congress of both parties are not very popular the shutdown seems to have only affected views of GOP incumbents"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. Three-fourths of people questioned in the survey said that most congressional Republicans don't deserved to be re-elected 21 percentage points higher than the 54% who say most Democrats don't deserve another term in office. Only one in five say most Republicans deserve to be re-elected; 42% say the same thing about Democrats on Capitol Hill.Deserve re-election?Yes NoDem 40% 56%GOP 20% 76%Now this question was asked of all Americans and NOT of registered voters (and obviously not of likely voters). The CNN pollask it of registered voters as well and from the smaller sample registered voters were slightly more angry at both parties. Here I've put it in chart form.Of note that 40% for Democrats among registered voters is actually not the worst we've seen in recent history. The August 2010 numbers had only 36% of registered voters saying Democrats deserved re-election to Congress. However that 20% for the GOP is thein the poll's history by far surpassing the previous low of just 31% taken back in August 2011 during the last debt ceiling fight.This is now spilling over into the generic ballot question as well.Fifty percent of registered voters questioned said they would vote for the Democrat in their district with 42% backing the Republican. The 8-point Democratic margin in the CNN poll is the same as in a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey and close to the 9-point advantage for the Democrats in the generic ballot in a recent Quinnipiac University poll. ""We're a long way away from saying that the Democrats have a chance to regain control of the House"" Holland cautioned. ""There is more than a year to go before any votes are actually cast and the 'generic ballot' question is not necessarily a good predictor of the actual outcome of 435 separate elections. A year before the 2010 midterms for example the Democrats held a 6-point lead on the generic ballot."" The Republicans eventually won back control of the House in 2010 thanks to a historic 63-seat pickup.So again while the signs look good now they looked good for Democrats as well in 2010 and we all know the misery that followed. The generic ballot question almost always overestimates how well Democrats will do an entire year out from the actual election. Notice in 2006 a good year for Democrats it only overestimated by a tiny bit. But in the midterm years good for the GOP like 2002 and 2010 anyone thinking we were going to do OK because of the generic ballot question was in for a rude awakening. So recent history tells us that even if 2014 turns out to be a good year for Democrats the generic ballot question STILL overestimates how well we're going to do a year ahead but only by a little.Notice in the 2010 average of the polls on October 21 2009 (exactly 4 years ago) Democrats held a 45%-39.5% advantage on the generic ballot question. And then a year later a massive 63-seat loss in the House with Republicans actually getting 51.6% of the vote and Democrats only getting 44.8% of the vote.So while this poll is good news don't you dare take anything for granted just yet.",0

Obama stole another such moment with his wife at the first of two official inaugural balls they were scheduled to attend Monday night.Obamas party with 30000 close friendsFollowing performances by Alicia Keys Brad Paisley and the Mexican rock group Mana the first couple danced as Jennifer Hudson sang the classic song “Let’s Stay Together” by Al Green.First lady Michelle Obama wore a floor-length custom ruby-colored chiffon and velvet gown designed by Jason Wu the same designer behind her 2009 inaugural dress.The celebrations came a day after Obama was sworn in on the constitutionally required date in a low-key ceremony at the White House. The flag-waving crowd that watched Monday’s event was noticeably smaller than the throng that turned out for his first oath in 2009 but still packed the National Mall for blocks.The waving flags the red-white-and-blue bunting and the heralding trumpets marked the 57th such ceremony in the history of the nation with the peaceful extension of power based on last November’s election that returned Obama to the White House.The best Inauguration Day tweetsThe Sousa marches the ceremonial guns and the voices of James Taylor Kelly Clarkson and Beyonce having faded away Obama headed into the Capitol for a luncheon with members of Congress. Then he led the traditional parade up Pennsylvania Avenue stopping near the White House to walk a few blocks of the route with the first lady to the cheers of those lining the sidewalks.“You’ve got to come out for this” said Nick Pignone a Washington resident. “Everyone’s excited – good vibes right now.”Also publicly sworn in for a second term was Vice President Joe Biden who like Obama also took his official oath Sunday. Justice Sonia Sotomayor performed the honors for Biden at his home at the Naval Observatory in Washington where the vice president’s extended family and a few Cabinet officials gathered to watch the ceremony.Biden and his wife Jill also took some time to walk part of the parade route with a grinning Biden periodically jogging over to the sidelines to shake hands with people across the barricades. Once both couples and their families were seated at the White House reviewing stand one of the first acts to pass was the marching band from Honolulu’s Punahou School Obama’s alma mater.What followed included dozens of military and school bands Native American dance troupes whirling in traditional dress war veterans Civil War re-enactors kilted firefighters blowing bagpipes and Montana’s governor and congressional delegation on horseback and in cowboy hats.10 opinions: Explaining Obama’s speechObama the first African-American president and the 17th to win a second term used a pair of Bibles in Monday’s ceremony – one from Abraham Lincoln the other from Martin Luther King Jr. His roughly 2000-word inaugural address hearkened back to both.“I did everything possible today to keep from crying” said U.S. Rep. John Lewis D-Georgia a onetime lieutenant of King. He called the sight of Obama using King’s Bible “very moving unreal – almost unbelievable.”Monday is also the federal holiday commemorating the birthday of King who was assassinated in 1968.The loudest cheer of Obama’s address came when he said the nation’s journey remained incomplete “until our wives our mothers and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts” and “until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law.”Obama embraces key social justice movements in inaugural addressObama begins the second half of his presidency with the opportunity to make it more historic but facing some of the same challenges that he struggled with in the first four years.Americans “have the power to set this country’s course” he said urging people to fulfill their citizenship by meeting “the obligation to shape the debates of our time – not only with the votes we cast but with the voices we lift in defense of our most ancient values and enduring ideals.”On the Mall Carlos Arieta and his wife Sharon took in the scene after driving from Atlanta to witness history. The former Washington residents said it was the first time they had attended an inauguration.Surprised by the throngs gathered a few hours before the speech on a clear morning with temperatures just above freezing Arieta said “it’s nice to see all the different kinds of people.”Even some of those who didn’t support Obama’s November re-election turned out to watch. Don King 27 and his 21-year-old brother Matthew said they don’t agree with the president on taxation debt and other fiscal issues but didn’t want to miss this bit of history.“It’s the second inauguration for Obama and it’s pretty amazing if you think back to the 1800s and later during the civil rights era that we’re here” Don King said.Obamas Bidens participate in National Day of ServiceA new CNN/ORC International poll released Monday indicated less excitement this time than four years ago when nearly 2 million people crowded the Mall despite frigid weather for Obama’s historic first inauguration.In January 2009 nearly seven in 10 Americans questioned in a CNN survey said they were thrilled or happy that Obama was about to take office. Now according to the new that number is down 18 points to 50%.Back then six in 10 saw Obama’s inauguration as a celebration by all Americans of democracy in action with just 39% saying it was a political celebration by the supporters of the winning candidate.Now the numbers are nearly reversed with 62% saying the second inauguration is a celebration by those backing the president and 35% saying it’s a celebration of democracy.“The thrill is gone along with the hope that the start of a new presidential term of office will bring a divided nation together” said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.Gergen: Obama 2.0 – tougher wiser?Reality of second-term presidenciesThe smaller crowd this time around reflects the reality of second-term presidencies when the novelty and expectations of a new leader have been replaced with the familiarity and experiences of the first act.For Obama that difference is even sharper. His historic ascendancy to the White House in 2008 came with soaring public hopes and expectations for a new kind of governance that would close the vast partisan gulf developed in recent decades.However a litany of challenges including an inherited economic recession and repeated battles with congressional Republicans over budgets and spending only hardened the opposing positions in Washington.Obama’s signature achievements including major reforms of the health care industry and Wall Street became symbols of political division with opponents constantly accusing him of hindering needed economic recovery.Obama’s unfinished business and battles aheadFor his second term Obama has vowed to press for an overhaul of the nation’s immigration policies and new ways to boost the sputtering economy proposals that are bound to spark battles with his Republican rivals and oversee the implementation of Obamacare.And the shootings at a Connecticut elementary school last month put the divisive issue of gun control on his immediate agenda.CNN polling released Sunday showed a majority of Americans – 54% – believe Obama will be an outstanding or above average president in his second term while 43% said he’d be poor or below average.And while overall seven in 10 Americans hope the president’s policies succeed only four in 10 Republicans feel that way with 52% hoping that Obama will fail.Obama’s second-term prioritiesBut House Majority Leader Eric Cantor R-Virginia told CNN “Today is the day for all of us in this country to come together.”“I think the president did a fine job certainly laying out what he would like to see happen as far as the future of the country” Cantor said. “There are areas of disagreement but there are also some things fundamentally we agree on and that is this country is one of opportunity. And sort of the way we get there to help everybody there are some differences. Hopefully we can bridge those differences.”Four other priorities for the next four yearsCNN’s Jennifer Liberto Dana Bash Dana Davidsen Ashley Killough Paul Steinhauser Jessica Yellin Dan Lothian Brianna Keilar Kevin Liptak and Gregory Wallace contributed to this report.",0
666,"Aamer Madhani and Bart Jansen USA TODAYAs mayor%2C Foxx hosted the 2012 Democratic National Convention in CharlotteIf confirmed by Senate%2C Foxx would replace the retiring Ray LaHoodFoxx%2C who is a Democrat%2C struck a bipartisan tone in remarks at the White HouseWASHINGTON -- President Obama announced Monday his choice of Charlotte Mayor Anthony Foxx to be his next Transportation secretary heralding the young mayor for revitalizing his city with critical investments in its transportation infrastructure.Foxx 41 raised his national profile after the Queen City hosted last year's Democratic National Convention.Obama noted that during Foxx's time as mayor ground was broken on the Charlotte Streetcar Project a third parallel runway at Charlotte-Douglass International Airport was opened and he worked to extend the LYNX light rail system to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.""When Anthony became mayor in 2009 Charlotte like the rest of the country was going through a bruising economic crisis"" Obama said. ""But the city managed to turn things around ... and if you ask Anthony how that happened he'll tell you one of the reason is that Charlotte made one of the largest investments in transportation in the city's history.""In brief remarks at the White House on Monday afternoon Foxx who is a Democrat struck a bipartisan tone.""There is no such thing a Democratic or Republican road bridge port airfield or rail system"" Foxx said. ""We must work together across party lines to enhance this nation's infrastructure.""The choice of Foxx who is Charlotte's youngest elected mayor and the second African-American mayor in the city's history also could help Obama dull criticism over the racial diversity of his Cabinet.Earlier this month Rep. Bennie Thompson D-Miss. criticized Obama for failing to name any African Americans among his early picks for his second-term Cabinet charging that the president ""has once again overlooked his most loyal constituency.""And Rep. Marcia Fudge D-Ohio chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus also complained in a letter to Obama last month that his recent Cabinet nominees ""have hardly been reflective of this country's diversity.''Obama was even ribbed by the comedian Conan O'Brien at Saturday's White House Correspondents Association's annual dinner in Washington over the lack of diversity in his Cabinet.""Mr. President your hair is so white it could be a member of your Cabinet"" O'Brien said.On Monday Fudge in a statement praised Obama's pick and said that Foxx ""will surely be an asset to the President's cabinet and to this nation."" Meanwhile Thompson said he was ""pleased with this development"" but that he ""will continue to hold the president accountable for ensuring he has a diverse Cabinet.""If confirmed by the Senate Foxx would become the second African American in Obama's second-term Cabinet joining Attorney General Eric Holder and United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice both first term holdovers. Foxx would replace Ray LaHood who announced earlier this year that he was stepping down as Transportation secretary once his replacement cleared the Senate.The president has boasted of the diversity in his White House and urged critics not to judge the makeup of his Cabinet until he completed his picks. He still needs to nominate a Commerce secretary and U.S. trade representative.Ahead of Obama's announcement Monday White House spokesman Jay Carney said that the president is ""pleased with the individuals who have agreed to accept his nominations for positions in the Cabinet.""""What you will see is a Cabinet that reflects the diversity of the country and the quality of people who are willing to serve their country in these important positions"" Carney said.Carl Tobias a law professor at the University of Richmond who studies federal nominations said Republicans will question Foxx's short résumé on transportation issues but predicted he'll sail through confirmation hearings. Foxx who was first elected Charlotte's mayor in 2009 is a lawyer by training. He's served on staff of the House Judiciary Committee and in the civil rights division of the Justice Department.""The Republicans on this kind of appointment as opposed to something like secretary of Defense are more likely to defer to the president"" Tobias said.If confirmed Foxx will immediately face a budget fight and several contentious rules for consumer protection and safety.A week of furloughs at the Federal Aviation Administration which delayed thousands of flights prompted Congress to allow the agency to shift around funding amid spending cuts to end the furloughs.But the spending battle remains for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 because the Obama administration wants to close tax loopholes while trimming spending but congressional Republicans oppose new revenues.The Transportation Department is also developing a consumer-protection rule dealing with how airlines market services such as baggage fees and seat assignments.Consumer groups and travel agents are urging the department to force airlines to provide the prices for those services to the companies that allow comparisons at sites like Travelocity and Orbitz. But airlines are opposed to being forced to provide the information because comparison sites charge billions of dollars collectively each year.Two safety rules are also pending at the FAA in reaction to the last fatal crash of a commercial airliner in February 2009. One rule expected in August proposes to require as many training hours for co-pilots as pilots with exceptions for military pilots and those graduating from four-year colleges. The other rule expected in October will require more simulator training about how to recover from a stall.""Without question our nation faces a number of transportation challenges that will require strong leadership and effective communication with Congress to keep our nation moving"" said Sen. John Thune the top Republican on the committee that will consider Foxx's nomination.Contributing: Deborah Berry",0
667,President Obama has never lacked for confidence but rarely has that attribute been on display as clearly as on Monday in an inaugural address that underscored the distance he has traveled after four contentious years in office.This was not the politician who campaigned in 2008 on themes of transcending the divisive politics of the past though there were ritual calls for the country and its political leaders to seize this moment together. Instead it was a president who has accepted the reality of those divisions and is determined to prevail on his terms.Obama’s first campaign was aspirational and he came to office believing or at least hoping that through force of personality he could gently guide the opposing sides to consensus on issues that had long resisted resolution. Monday’s speech conveyed the ambitions of a president looking at his next four years with a sense of frustration and impatience and who now believes that a different style of leadership is required.In his speech Obama set out his priorities for a second term goals that will cheer the liberal wing of the Democratic Party and probably alarm many on the right. He challenged Republicans to meet him partway though not exactly in the middle. If there was an underlying message Monday it was not “Come let us reason together.” It was “Follow me.” The question is whether he will be any more successful in his second term than he was in his first.Pressure on RepublicansThere are reasons for the president setting a different tone in his second inaugural than in his first. Two years after he and his party took a beating in the midterm elections he now holds the strongest hand in Washington. His approval ratings have climbed above 50 percent while his Republican opponents in Congress remain mired in disapproval ratings almost three times as high as their approval ratings.1 of 57 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × 2013 inauguration: Waiting watching bearing witness View Photos Washington woke early Monday to begin its quadrennial ritual of watching waiting and bearing witness to the presidential swearing-in. Caption Washington woke early Monday to begin its quadrennial ritual of watching waiting and bearing witness to the presidential swearing-in. Jan. 21 2013 Charles Smith who works for the Interior Department removes flag sticks from the Mall after the inaugural ceremonies. Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post Wait 1 second to continue.Obama once hoped that he could overcome the united opposition of congressional Republicans whose militant House members set the party’s tone during the battles of the past two years through negotiation with GOP leaders. Now he is looking to the country to pressure his opponents to compromise in ways that they would not during his first term.Republicans have already tested the reelected president and discovered the limits of their power. Their decision not to pick a fight — for now — over the debt ceiling signaled their recognition of that reality. It was an acknowledgment that the tactic of opposing Obama at almost every turn may be self-defeating.Obama appears ready to try to split the Republican coalition by setting pragmatists against ideologues. On Monday he rebuked those who have been most aggressive in their opposition when he said “We cannot mistake absolutism for principle or substitute spectacle for politics or treat name-calling as reasoned debate.”Republicans will have to choose their battles more carefully and they may prevail in some cases. Obama knows that he won’t get all he wants but the balance of power at the start of his second term is far different from what it was 24 months ago.The year ahead promises more debates over the size and scope of government issues that dominated the past two years in Washington. Obama acknowledged the need to deal with spending and the deficit but he also set out terms for the coming fight over federal entitlements.During the campaign Obama talked about the philosophical divide between Republicans and Democrats on these issues as he condemned the broken politics of Washington. He said the American people could break the tie with the election.But the election returned a majority of Republicans to the House and on Monday the president seemed to suggest that there were grounds for compromise. “Progress” he said “does not compel us to settle centuries-long debates about the role of government for all time but it does require us to act in our time.”Addressing his coalitionObama’s second inaugural address also reflected a changing America and the coalition that reelected him to office. The nation’s first African American president leads an ever-more diverse population and a country in which attitudes and mores continue to change particularly among the youngest segment of society.The policy agenda he put forth and the values he enunciated spoke directly to that coalition. Never before has a president used an inaugural address to speak so openly about the cause of gay rights linking the 1969 Stonewall uprising that led to the gay rights movement with Selma and civil rights and the 1839 Seneca Falls Convention and women’s rights.Not all Americans agree with these changes and as president Obama must attempt to speak for them and to them. But his remarks Monday suggest that he believes history is on his side on these issues.The president’s second inaugural address was notable also for what he talked about only in brief. Four years ago he stood on the Capitol’s West Front with the country facing an economic crisis. Output was falling the stock market had plunged many Americans were threatened with housing foreclosures and unemployment was rising rapidly. He talked about “a sapping of confidence across our land.”On Monday he touched only lightly on that crisis and spoke of the economy in positive terms. “An economic recovery has begun” he said. At a time when jobs remain a top priority for most Americans he chose neither to highlight that problem nor to offer any new solutions — though ultimately he will be judged on his effectiveness in restoring the economy to its full strength.Opponents will find much to dislike about what Obama said Monday for this was not a speech aimed at mollifying those who lost the election. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) who lost the presidential race four years ago expressed disappointment that Obama was not more explicit about bringing the two sides together. “I would have liked to have seen more on outreach and working together” McCain said. But the senator added “It’s his privilege to say what he wants.”Obama risks overreaching or over-interpreting his mandate which can be an affliction of newly reelected presidents. His victory in November was decisive but not overwhelming. Self-confidence can slip over the line to arrogance or hubris. Second terms often disappoint. So there are dangers ahead for the president.On Monday he set out his ambitions for a second term in clear language. What follows will define how history judges both those priorities and his ability to turn them into action.,1
668,God bless Mitch McConnell.The Senate Republican leader isn’t an especially lovable figure. Even many of his fellow conservatives are lukewarm about him.He’s colorless and charisma-free. He’s a thoroughgoing partisan who has launched more filibusters than any Senate leader in history. He’s a relentless fan of unlimited campaign spending and a bitter opponent not just of Obamacare but of all things Obama. Asked in 2010 to describe his highest legislative goal he said it was to make sure Barack Obama was a one-term president.PHOTOS: Tea party backlash: Protest signs to cheer you upAdvertisementBut the wily Kentuckian is also an old-fashioned legislative strategist who can count votes discern when his party is holding a losing hand and make the decision to cut a deal.That’s what McConnell did this week when he sat down with his Democratic counterpart the equally unlovable Harry Reid of Nevada and struck a bargain to reopen the federal government and avert the danger of a default on the national debt.“No one wants a default” McConnell said. “So let’s put this hysterical talk of default behind us and instead start talking about finding solutions.”McConnell took a distinct political risk in agreeing to extend the federal debt ceiling until February with almost no strings attached. The Senate Conservatives Fund a fundraising group that backs primary challenges to Republicans it deems insufficiently hard-line denounced him for “negotiating surrender.” (This column won’t do him much good either.)AdvertisementBut McConnell could read the polls. The longer the government shutdown continued and the closer the nation came to a politically induced financial crisis the more the GOP was losing.And McConnell a ferocious enforcer of discipline knew he could deliver most of his party’s votes. “There are few things more daunting in politics” Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) once said “than the determined opposition of Sen. McConnell.”But whether a deal is on track by the time you read this column — something in no way certain as I write these words — doesn’t depend on McConnell alone. His counterpart on the other side of Capitol Hill has a tougher job.House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) who holds a safe seat and commands a 32-seat majority can’t manage to work his will among the 232 Republicans who chose him as their leader.AdvertisementOn Tuesday Boehner and his lieutenants tried to unveil a proposal of their own to end the budget standoff one with tougher conditions than the bargain McConnell struck with Reid. The idea was to give the House a coherent position from which to negotiate with the Senate and to avoid being “jammed” to accept the McConnell-Reid deal as the Oct. 17 deadline for lifting the debt ceiling bore down.In a basement conference room in the Capitol on Tuesday morning House Republicans gathered bowed their heads and — in lieu of an opening prayer — sang three a cappella verses of “Amazing Grace.”It went downhill from there. Tea party conservatives who had caucused the night before at a Mexican restaurant called Tortilla Coast complained that Boehner’s draft didn’t do enough to block Obama’s healthcare law. Fiscal conservatives balked at lifting the debt ceiling for as long as the four months proposed by the Senate.Boehner warned his colleagues — as he has many times — that flirting with the debt ceiling was a bad idea. “The idea of default is wrong and we shouldn’t get anywhere close to it” he said. But after a day of backroom negotiations the speaker withdrew his own draft proposal leaving the House without any plan at all.AdvertisementThe difference between the two leaders isn’t merely a matter of talent or style. Because House members represent much smaller often more homogenous constituencies many of them see no reason to compromise. This week for example as polls showed the Republican Party plummeting in the eyes of voters Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) dismissed the numbers saying it was more important for conservatives to stick to their principles.McConnell’s challenge is different: His mission is to make it possible for Republicans to win the six more seats they need to secure a majority in the Senate. That means fighting for conservative principles when he can but not at the cost of diminishing the GOP’s appeal to centrist voters.In the House the roughly 35 Republicans who ally with the tea party make the difference between a majority and a minority for the GOP. In the Senate McConnell has to contend with only three tea party renegades in his caucus of 48: Ted Cruz of Texas Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky.The difference mirrors the larger dilemma faced by the Republican Party nationwide: Should it focus on building a grass-roots movement of committed tea party conservatives or seek to enlarge its coalition by welcoming more moderates and pragmatists?AdvertisementThe answer matters to McConnell in more ways than one. He faces a well-funded Tea Party opponent in Kentucky’s GOP primary next year. If he can survive that challenge and help six more Republicans win Senate seats he might yet achieve his ambition of being sworn in as majority leader in 2015.doyle.mcmanus@latimes.comTwitter: @Doyle McManus,1

670,"EDITOR'S NOTE: CNN’s Jake Tapper takes viewers inside the deadly battle at Combat Outpost Keating in an exclusive interview with Romesha and others who fought off the Taliban attack. “An American Hero: The Uncommon Valor of Clint Romesha” will air Thursday February 7th at 10pET on CNN.Next week President Barack Obama will award former U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Clinton Romesha the nation's highest award for combat valor for his actions in repelling a deadly insurgent onslaught in Afghanistan in October 2009. He is the fourth living recipient to receive the award for service in Iraq or Afghanistan.In an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper Romesha describes his thoughts about seeing Combat Outpost Keating for the first time. The remote outpost was at the foot of three large mountains and surrounded by a river on one side as well. By all military standards the base was virtually impossible to defend because of the looming mountains that would ultimately give the Taliban a tactical advantage to shoot down into the base and offer deep cover to those fighters in the rocky mountainsides.""This is a pretty indefensible spot. This is the exact opposite of when you open up the manual and look in to find the definition of finding a defensible spot this is the total opposite of it"" Romesha said in the interview with Tapper.Romesha is being recognized for his courage at COP Keating against the onslaught of hundreds of Taliban fighters. With just over 50 troops inside the tiny base Romesha directed and led several charges to repel the 12 hour long attack and regain control of the outpost which had been overrun.The assault on the outpost in the eastern province of Nuristan goes down as one of the deadliest attacks on U.S. troops in Afghanistan with eight soldiers killed and more than 20 wounded.Romesha tells Tapper in an emotional account about his failed attempt to save a close friend taff Sgt. Justin T. Gallegos who was trapped in a vehicle which had come under heavy Taliban fire.""There was movement everywhere. There was muzzle flashes everywhere. You just couldn’t pick them out fast enough. I tried to hold it as long as I could but when you’re the only machine gun pocking on the COP at that point you start drawing quite a bit of attention and finished the belt and scurried on back"" Romesha said. ""I called Gallegos and told him told I was sorry. I just told him I was sorry. I couldn’t hold that position for him anymore and they were still stuck.""",1
671,Recent polling shows that an election wave of anti-ObamaCare sentiment is growing and it is not only likely to hand the GOP control of the United States Senate but might wipe out as many as 12 Democrat seats–many of which looked safe just a few months ago.Back in July Five Thirty Eight’s election guru Nate Silver believed that control of the Senate was a tossup. That has all changed now that voters got their first real look at the brutal consequences of ObamaCare.Starting with the generic ballot that simply pits Republican lawmakers against their Democrat counterparts the movement towards the GOP has been striking. In the Real Clear Politics average of these polls going back as far as the beginning of the year Democrats have consistently led by 3 to 4 points. During the government shutdown Democrats leaped to 6 and 7 point leads. Since the disastrous rollout of ObamaCare though Republicans are not only in the lead by 2.5 points; they have led in every poll but one since November 10.This generic polling is reflected in the available polling of individual Senate seats.Keep in mind that in order to win control of the Senate Republicans need only pick up six seats and with Democrat incumbents retiring in the redder than red states of South Dakota West Virginia and Montana Republicans pretty much have three Senate pick-ups in the bag. But thanks to ObamaCare and vulnerable Democrat Senators refusing to put their own promises and the wellbeing of their constituents above slavish devotion to Obama picking off another three should be fairly easy.Kay Hagan (D-NC)In North Carolina Democrat Kay Hagan looked as though she was cruising to a second term victory. Just a few months ago polls showed her ahead by double digits against her most likely Republican challengers.In September before ObamaCare started cancelling people’s policies by the millions and boosting the price of their premiums Hagan was beating potential challenger Greg Bannon by a whopping 16 points. In the most recent poll taken just a couple weeks ago Bannon picked up an astonishing 17 points and is now ahead by 1.All of Hagan’s most likely Republican challengers made similar gains.There is a YouTube video of Hagan promising that under ObamaCare you can keep your insurance if you like it. Obviously that is not true which means she either lied or blindly voted for something without understanding the consequences for her constituents.Mary Landrieu (D-LA)Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu has seen her approval rating collapse by double digits in just six months. Three months ago Landrieu looked as though she would coast to a fourth term in a state Mitt Romney won without breaking a sweat. The National Journal now lists Landrieu as the third most endangered incumbent facing re-election in 2014.In August Landrieu was polling over 50% in potential match ups (which would avoid a Louisiana runoff that requires the eventual winner hit at least 50%) and beating Republican Congressman Bill Cassidy her most likely opponent by a full 10 points. The consequences of ObamaCare have completely flipped that script.A recent poll shows the relatively unknown Cassidy behind by only 2 pointsThere is YouTube video of Landrieu promising her constituents that under ObamaCare you can keep your insurance. The facts have either proved Landrieu a liar or incompetent. Other than token legislation to keep that promise Landrieu has been as devoted to Obama and ObamaCare as any liberal Democrat.Mark Pryor (D-AR)Thanks to ObamaCare Senator Mark Pryor’s approval ratings in Arkansas have collapsed to just 33% the lowest of his 12 years in the Senate. When Democrat Arkansas incumbent Senator Blanche Lincoln lost her seat in 2010 her approval ratings were actually higher. The National Journal ranks Pryor as the most vulnerable Senate incumbent facing reelection in 2014.Pryor is also on record misleading his constituents about ObamaCare.Mark Begich (D-AK)Just before the disastrous ObamaCare rollout Alaskan Senator Mark Begich was cruising to reelection by as much as 11 points. Post-ObamaCare polls show that Begich has been considerably weakened and is ahead by only a point or two against his likely Republican challengers. Moreover Begich’s approval rating among Alaskans now sits at a measly 39%.Begich is on record misleading his constituents with false assurances that under ObamaCare you can keep your insurance. The GOP is already pounding him over that.Other than token proposals Begich has done absolutely nothing to either keep that promise or to mitigate the damage ObamaCare is doing to Alaskans.The National Journal lists Begich as the second most vulnerable incumbent in the Senate.Iowa – Open Democrat SeatWith longtime Democrat Tom Harkin retiring from the Senate Democrats thought they had made this seat safe with the recruitment of Rep. Bruce Braley. Until the American people were rattled by the consequences of ObamaCare Democrats were probably right. In matchup after matchup Braley was ahead by double digits.Post-ObamaCare that lead has shrunk to single digits.Mark Udall (D-CO)Prior to the ObamaCare rollout Udall wasn’t even on the National Journal‘s list of endangered incumbents. Millions of insurance cancellations later however and the Democrat has a real fight on his hands. In one likely match up Udall’s 15 point lead back in June has dropped to just 3 points.—Since the ObamaCare fallout the National Journal has added Al Franken (D-MN) Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Jeff Merkley (D-OR) to its 2014 endangered list. Prior to the country being hit upside the head with the reality of ObamaCare the idea that any one of these incumbents had anything to worry about was unthinkable.Shaheen is vulnerable enough that former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown is considering a challenge. Polls show her under 50% at 48% and Brown only behind by 4%. He hasn’t even made it official and is already within the margin of error. And if he runs it will be on the issue of ObamaCare.Many believe that the worst of ObamaCare has yet to show itself. As the 2014 midterm elections loom closer late next year so will the employer mandate. The Obama Administration itself has predicted that the fallout from the employer mandate could be tens of millions of cancellations.Knowing this is coming and unless something changes these vulnerable Democrats are likely to be remembered only as having done nothing to avoid catastrophes mainly afflicting the working and middle class.That is other than hold hands with Obama to watch it all burn.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC,1

673,"You likely remember this but let's just do some quick catching up. On Sept. 17 2012 Mother Jones released a video helped by former President Carter's grandson of a private fundraiser for Mitt Romney. Here's what the GOP presidential nominee said:There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what. All right there are 47 percent who are with him who are dependent upon government who believe that they are victims who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them who believe that they are entitled to health care to food to housing to you name it. That that's an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what. And I mean the president starts off with 48 49 48—he starts off with a huge number. These are people who pay no income tax. Forty-seven percent of Americans pay no income tax. So our message of low taxes doesn't connect. And he'll be out there talking about tax cuts for the rich. I mean that's what they sell every four years. And so my job is not to worry about those people—I'll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.MORE FROM NATIONAL JOURNALThe remarks turned out to be quite damning. And now 10 months later there are new words from Mitt Romney trying to jedi mind trick the old ones all away.RELATED: 100% of New Obama Ads Are Talking About 47%In a Washington Post excerpt of Dan Balz's upcoming book on the 2012 election Romney put forward one of his most adamant defenses of the 47 percent comments. Balz's interview with Romney took place in late January 2013. Here's Romney on what went through his head when he first heard about the video being released:As I understood it and as they described it to me not having heard it it was saying 'Look the Democrats have 47 percent we've got 45 percent my job is to get the people in the middle and I've got to get the people in the middle.'... And I thought 'Well that's a reasonable thing.' ... It's not a topic I talk about in public but there's nothing wrong with it. They've got a bloc of voters we've got a bloc of voters I've got to get the ones in the middle. And I thought that that would be how it would be perceived — as a candidate talking about the process of focusing on the people in the middle who can either vote Republican or Democrat. As it turned out down the road it became perceived as being something very different.Story continuesCalling the idea behind the comments ""a reasonable thing"" is a bit off from Romney's comments this June in which he told CNN that he was ""very upset"" over what he said. The new view of his remarks also pushed aside the idea that those 47 percent weren't just ""Democrats"" but in Romney's assessment were ""dependent upon government ... believe they are victims"" and that he'd never be able to ""convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.""RELATED: James O'Keefe Is the Real Victim HereBalz specifically asked Romney about the ""personal responsibility"" remark. Mitt Romney said it was fiction:Actually I didn't say that.... That's how it began to be perceived and so I had to ultimately respond to the perception because perception is reality.Think of it as a ""sorry I'm not sorry."" It's also a fascinating one-sentence summation of how easy it is for a campaign aparatus to become an impenetrable bubble.RELATED: Scott Brown Goes All In on Warren's Cherokee Pa-PawRomney then presented Balz with his own take on the event. Some of which is here:In two months my job is to get the people in the middle. But this was perceived as 'Oh he's saying 47 percent of the people he doesn't care about or he's insensitive to or they don't care—they don't take responsibility for their life.' No no. I'm saying 47 percent of the people don't pay taxes and therefore they don't warm to our tax message. But the people who are voting for the president my job isn't to try and get them. My job is to get the people in the middle. And I go on and say that. Take a look. Look at the full quote. But I realized look perception is reality. The perception is I'm saying I don't care about 47 percent of the people or something of that nature and that's simply wrong.This doesn't really mesh with the full quotation above from Mother Jones's video transcript. Mother Jones's David Corn was caught pretty surprised by the new comments. But Romney did realize one thing:Well clearly that was a very damaging quote and hurt my campaign effort.That's a statement you don't need much more context for.",0

675,RICHMOND Va. — Ken Cuccinelli is running for governor not Congress but the Virginia Republican is struggling to dodge the political fallout from Capitol Hill.His campaign in this crucial battleground state is in danger of becoming the first political casualty of the federal government shutdown which Americans largely blame on Republicans.AdvertisementWith the election just weeks away Cuccinelli’s poll numbers have tumbled since federal agencies were closed Oct. 1. The conservative state attorney general was already lagging but he went from within striking distance of a vulnerable Democrat to trailing by 8 to 10 percentage points in three independent polls.As the candidate a tea party favorite seeks to distance himself from fellow activists in Congress national Republican leaders are worried that a key office they expected to hold in a closely watched election is slipping away.AdvertisementThey also fear the shutdown could tarnish the party’s brand ahead of next year’s midterm election.Not all Republican candidates are suffering because of the shutdown. In Democratic New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie a GOP nonconformist is positioned to cruise to reelection.AdvertisementChristie is conservative but he has not allied himself with the tea party. Instead he has focused on issues that most concern voters such as the runaway costs of public employee benefits and he is moving ahead with President Obama’s healthcare law. The New Jersey governor shows little regard for how his policies affect score cards with activists on the right.“Republicans should think about these things as they ponder who to support in 2016” said strategist Steve Schmidt who ran Arizona Sen. John McCain’s presidential campaign in 2008. Schmidt sees the Virginia race as a cautionary tale for the party. “You have a campaign that has been unable to transcend its ideological baggage running against someone who would have been beatable with almost any other conceivable candidate.”AdvertisementCuccinelli also has the misfortune to be running in the state with the most federal workers. Analysts say the uneasiness many voters had with Cuccinelli’s tea party brand of Republicanism has solidified into outright opposition.“The shutdown is hurting Cuccinelli” said Quentin Kidd a professor of political science at Christopher Newport University in Newport News Va. For voters on the fence he said “it helped them make a decision. They thought ‘If that is the kind of thing we’d be looking at with Ken Cuccinelli then I am not interested.’”AdvertisementEstablishment Republicans are frustrated. The Democratic nominee Terry McAuliffe is a former chairman of the national party and is saddled with baggage.His business dealings have long attracted unflattering media attention including allegations that he cashed in on his Clinton-era political connections to grow his personal fortune. At the Democratic National Committee his fundraising tactics pushed ethical boundaries. He’s been compared to a carnival barker and a used car salesman.AdvertisementBut in a part of the country that has drifted from solidly red to solidly purple polls suggest the statewide electorate would sooner vote for a candidate who may strike them as smarmy than one allied with the Republican Party’s most extreme politicians.“I don’t like McAuliffe but I really don’t like Cuccinelli” said Cindy Freese 59 a retired reinsurance executive in Alexandria who is registered as an independent. Her husband is a federal employee poised to miss his mid-month paycheck. Freese said she would “absolutely” vote for a moderate Republican for governor “but there aren’t any anymore.”AdvertisementVirginia’s electoral landscape like that of the country overall has shifted amid an influx of immigrants and the growth of diverse suburbs. In last year’s presidential election the Obama campaign used those changing demographics to its advantage microtargeting voters with messaging that appealed to them. McAuliffe has recruited some of the data whizzes and strategists behind that effort to replicate it in Virginia.The Cuccinelli campaign represents the traditional approach. The candidate is the kind of firebrand conservative whom party activists believe energizes voters in the style of Ronald Reagan. As attorney general he fought to block Obama’s healthcare law. A climate change skeptic he started an investigation into a University of Virginia scientist whose research warned of a rise in temperatures. He has condemned homosexuality and sought to reinstate anti-sodomy laws rejected by the courts.AdvertisementThat record is not playing well with many Virginians uneasy with the rigid ideologies at the root of the shutdown. At a University of Richmond forum last week Cuccinelli avoided much of it.He lamented the refusal to compromise in Congress saying he opposes the shutdown. He said Republicans failed the country on healthcare by not doing anything to fix a broken system when they controlled the White House and Congress. Asked to name the biggest social policy on his agenda Cuccinelli responded “That isn’t what I am running on.”AdvertisementMcAuliffe reminded the audience that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) a current tea party favorite had just campaigned in Virginia for Cuccinelli. “The architect of the shutdown was here last week” McAuliffe said. “He and Ken Cuccinelli went to an event together. I wouldn’t have even been in the same room with Ted Cruz with all the damage he has done.”To be sure Cuccinelli’s stumble began before the shutdown. Federal investigators are looking into a business executive’s connections to Gov. Bob McDonnell and the inquiry has tainted the state party. Cuccinelli’s attacks on McAuliffe’s ethics were blunted when it came out that he had accepted $18000 in gifts from the businessman.AdvertisementBut it was only after federal employees were told not to report to work that McAuliffe nearly doubled his lead in the polls.“What has happened here reflects the challenges the GOP faces nationally” Virginia Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling said.AdvertisementA moderate Republican Bolling opted not to run for governor when the party decided to choose its candidate with a convention not an election at the behest of activists seeking to ensure the nominee would be loyal to the base.“Now” he said “Democrats have been able to use the shutdown to remind mainstream Virginia voters about what their concerns are: Would Ken Cuccinelli be able to govern in a mainstream way? Or would he govern the state in the style you are seeing in D.C.?”Advertisementevan.halper@latimes.com,0

677,"And it's not just tea party supporters Republicans and gun owners.Nearly two-fifths of Democrats (38 percent) say the government is a threat to them personally as do 45 percent of non-gun owners.Overall the percentage of Americans who view the federal government as a threat has increased from 36 percent in May 1995 to 53 percent today. It rose late in the 1990s and then dropped again after 9/11 down to 30 percent.Story continues below advertisementToday most Americans now feel at least somewhat scared of what the government could do to them and 31 percent see Washington as a ""major threat.""This is an important piece of data to keep in mind as Congress debates new gun legislation. While polls show broad support for expanding background checks and limiting the manufacture and sale of certain types of so-called assault weapons the flip side of that is that many Americans are wary of their government going too far in restricting their constitutional rights -- be it on guns or anything else.AdvertisementAnd if gun rights supporters can convince the public (and members of Congress) that the legislation creates a too-powerful federal government that impinges on people's rights and freedoms they may help reverse their early deficit in the polls.The American public is very receptive to such a message.Story continues below advertisementDNC has huge debt; RNC has none: Thursday was the deadline for political candidates and committees to file their year-end financial reports.

679,Wave elections are rare. Only a handful of times in the previous century has one party racked up big wins. Democrats won big handfuls of House seats in 1930 1932 1948 1958 1974 2006 and 2008. Republicans won back more than 40 seats in 1938 1942 1946 1966 1994 and 2010. And with nearly a year to go before Election Day voters’ moods can change dramatically.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementBut the rocky rollout of the Affordable Care Act and President Obama’s crumbling support suggests another wave might be building. While voters usually punish a president’s party in at least one midterm election they may be winding up to deliver another smack to President Obama’s allies on Capitol Hill.Voter dislike of ObamaCare cost Democrats the House in 2010. It could cost them the Senate in 2014.The poll numbers hint at the toll the Affordable Care Act has taken on the Democratic Party. A CNN/ORC International poll conducted November 18-20 shows 49 percent of registered voters favored a generic Republican candidate for Congress compared with 47 percent who favored a Democratic candidate. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted November 6-11 shows the generic ballot tied at 39 percent each.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementHistorically Democrats have held an advantage of at least a few points on the generic ballot even when election results are a wash: Democrats held a six-point edge just before Election Day 2000 and picked up a grand total of one seat. Democrats led Republicans by one point on the generic ballot just before the 2010 elections when Republicans rode to a sweeping victory.And there’s no sign that Obama will become more popular. Presidents who see their approval ratings dip so dramatically in the second term rarely see their numbers improve. Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon’s approval ratings never recovered after the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal (Nixon of course didn’t stick around to see just how far his ratings could fall). George W. Bush’s approval rating sank in the spring of 2005 and continued falling through the end of his term. Obama’s numbers are starting to resemble Bush’s trend lines.For much of Obama’s tenure even voters who say they disapproved of his job performance still retained a favorable impression of the president. That’s increasingly not the case: In the latest Washington Post/ABC News survey conducted earlier this month Obama’s unfavorable rating 52 percent tops his favorable rating 46 percent. It’s only the second time [pdf] the number of unfavorable impressions outweighed the favorable ones.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementReaction to the bungled rollout of the health care law is overwhelmingly to blame. Already the fallout has been evident: Public surveys in Virginia showed Gov.-elect Terry McAuliffe (D) leading Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli (R) by wide margins in the wake of the government shutdown. But Cuccinelli made the final weeks of the race into a referendum on ObamaCare and McAuliffe’s support began to erode. On Election Day McAuliffe won by just 2.5 points a narrower margin than even his internal polls showed. Another week and Cuccinelli might be governor-elect.Democrats will say the Republican Party is in even worse shape than they are and they have a point: In the October Washington Post/ABC News poll just 32 percent of voters said they had a favorable impression of the GOP compared with 46 percent who had a favorable impression of the Democratic Party. And Republicans still have not articulated a clear governing vision for the country even a year after failure to do so emerged as a central criticism of Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign.But back in 2010 40 percent told Post pollsters they viewed Republicans in a favorable light 10 points lower than those who said they saw Democrats favorably. Republicans feigned a national platform akin to the Contract With America but their pitch to voters was more about what they were against — namely Democrats and ObamaCare — than what they were for. Voters have backed the unpopular party with few ideas over the slightly-more-popular party with unpopular ideas before.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe stakes are highest for Democratic senators seeking re-election in red states where the Affordable Care Act is even more widely despised than it is nationally. Democratic incumbents in Arkansas Louisiana North Carolina and Alaska will face added headwinds unless the political climate changes.And there aren’t many opportunities for Democrats to change that climate.The one opportunity that Democrats do have lies in negotiations over the federal budget. October’s government shutdown gave Democrats a temporary advantage and if Republican hardliners pursue the same path they could hand Democrats an opening. But with Republican anger at Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and others who led the shutdown crusade at such pitched levels it seems unlikely Republicans would repeat their political mistakes of this fall.,1
680,Story highlights Julian Zelizer: Washington's budget fight will grab public's attention if no deal reached He says painful cuts will lead the public to blame Republicans for Washington's dysfunction Americans don't like government spending in general but like specific programs he says Zelizer: GOP needs to rethink its reliance on deficit reduction as a prime strategyEditor’s Note: Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. He is the author of “Jimmy Carter” and “Governing America.”Until now “sequestration” has been a word that only means something to people living inside the Beltway or to political junkies who depend on their daily dose of Politico and The Hill. But if Congress and the president do not reach a deal by March 1 which appears likely Americans will quickly learn what it means – namely deep spending cuts.The spending cuts pose a significant political threat to Republicans more so than to Democrats. Although many Republicans are standing firm insisting that their party will be fine if the cuts go through there are many reasons for the GOP through a sober eye to see the dangers that lay ahead.The cuts could push congressional politics in a liberal direction and establish the foundation for solid Democratic gains in 2014.Last week Bob Woodward argued that President Obama was responsible for the sequester idea not the Republicans. But while people are squabbling over who owns the sequester the GOP will take the hit regardless.Larry Levanti Julian ZelizerThe danger for Republicans is that the budget cuts will severely weaken public support for the austerity theme that the party has been promoting since 2010. The cuts will make “deficit reduction” something very real to average American citizens and business and something that is often quite painful rather than an abstract debate over numbers.Opinion: One cuts Washington throws a tantrumWhile Americans have historically been hostile to government they tend to support specific government services when asked by pollsters. So Washington’s overall spending might not be popular as a concept but Social Security and Medicare are.The spending cuts will shift the debate toward the specifics. Americans will watch as government services are retrenched. The last time this happened things didn’t go well for the GOP.Get our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and FacebookWhen the federal government shut down in 1995-1996 because of a budget standoff between Republicans and President Clinton the GOP faced a huge backlash when Americans were unable to access basic government services such as obtaining a passport or visiting the national zoo.Opinion: The spending cut fairy talePresident Obama has already been using the bully pulpit to make this case appearing with first responders and warning of how the cuts will impact police hospitals teachers airline workers and more. Standing in front of a group of police officers Obama said “Federal prosecutors will have to close cases and let criminals go.” While these speeches are a form of political theater they are based on very real possibilities.The budget cuts that result from sequestration would just be the first of the threats the GOP faces. If the government has to shut down as a result of a standoff when the government’s general operating budget expires in late March or the debt ceiling is not raised this spring Republicans will continue to lose the public’s confidence in their ability to govern and the reduction in services will highlight to Americans what the government actually does.If the economy sputters as a result of the spending cuts as some economists predict deficit reduction will look even worse. An already frustrated workforce will become even more angry and likely take out their frustration on a Republican Party that has been insisting deficit reduction should be the nation’s short-term goal rather than stimulating the economy.Conservatives will suffer as the focus of congressional debate will quickly shift from the issue of spending cuts where the emphasis has been since 2011 to the issue of spending more.Once the cuts go through frustration and anger with the impact on government services will certainly produce increased pressure on legislators in both parties to offer a fix namely to restore spending to key areas.Borger: Obama can’t kick his legacy down the roadWith legislators already thinking about the 2014 elections this will be tempting. If this shift occurs Republicans who have invested so much in making fiscal discipline their top issue will be operating in a congressional environment where the debates center around areas where the government needs to devote more government resources rather than less.The automatic spending cuts are the ultimate symbol of a dysfunctional government. The reason the cuts were put into place was that President Obama and Congress were unable to reach an agreement on taxes and spending. Government leaders agreed to put a gun to their own head by threatening unpalatable cuts if they were unable to reach a deal. Now the trigger is about to be pulled.The problem for Republicans is that the polls show that the approval rating of the GOP is in the tank while President Obama is doing relatively well. According to Quinnipiac University only 19% of Americans approve of how Republicans are handling their job.Obama is enjoying his highest favorability ratings since 2009 with 60% having a favorable rating of him in a Washington Post-ABC poll. The likelihood as in 1995-1996 is that the public will blame the dysfunction on the GOP rather than Democrats and the party will suffer a further erosion of its standing as a result.According to a recent poll by the Pew Foundation and USA Today Republicans would be blamed for the cuts by almost half of Americans while only 31% would blame Obama.News: Top Senate Republican doubts damage from defense cutsSequestration will soon become a dirty word in the American political lexicon. While it is impossible to predict which way the political winds will blow there is good reason for Republicans to see how they can suffer politically if some kind of deal is not reached.Republicans who have now struggled through two presidential elections and are facing a demographic shift that does not work in their favor might want to start thinking harder about their strategy on spending. Deficit reduction is no longer a winning issue for the GOP.Follow @CNNOpinion on Twitter.Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion.The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer,1
681,"Two Republican lawmakers on the House Science Committee are accusing the Environmental Protection Agency of pushing through a rule that could potentially expand the agency’s regulatory authority over streams wetlands and other bodies under the Clean Water Act.Reps. Lamar Smith R-Texas and Chris Stewart R-Utah on Friday sent a letter to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy expressing concern over the proposed draft rule which they say would give the agency “unprecedented control over private property across the nation.”The rule which aims to clarify the agency's regulatory jurisdiction over different types of water bodies was sent to the Office of Management and Budget in September for review. The agency has said the scope of the proposal is limited to clearing up confusion caused by Supreme Court decisions involving the Clean Water Act.The lawmakers claimed the agency is engaging in a ""rushed politicized regulatory process"" and called for the EPA's independent science advisory board to review the science underlying the proposal.""In light of the significant implications this action would have on the economy property rights and state sovereignty this process must be given more thought and deliberation to allow for important statutorily-required weighing of the scientific and technical underpinnings of the proposed regulatory changes"" the lawmakers wrote.In September the agency released a report from its science advisory board analyzing the relationships between smaller isolated bodies of water and larger ones. The report which served as the basis for the proposal concluded that streams and wetlands have important effects on downstream waters.The EPA plans to accept public comments on the draft rule before finalizing it but the agency has not indicated whether it will comply with the lawmakers' request to allow for an independent review of the science underpinning the rule.“Any attempt to issue a proposed rule before completing an independent examination by the agency’s own science advisors would be to put the cart before the horse” Smith and Stewart wrote.In January EPA critics and officials in Virginia scored a key victory in their legal battle with the agency over its attempt to regulate stormwater runoff that some described as a land takeover.In the Virginia case a federal judge ruled in favor of the state Department of Transportation and the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors which challenged EPA's restrictions on the flow of stormwater into a Fairfax County creek.U.S. District Judge Liam O'Grady in Alexandria agreed with Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli who argued that the EPA was trying to regulate water itself as a pollutant. In his ruling O'Grady said: ""Stormwater runoff is not a pollutant so EPA is not authorized to regulate it.""The EPA contended that water itself can be regulated as a pollutant if there's too much of it. The agency says heavy runoff is having a negative impact on Accotink Creek and that it has the regulatory authority to remedy the situation.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",1
682,The headline reads “McAuliffe avoids position on EPA rules Cuccinelli dodges on House spending vote” because just like Virginia’s Democrat gubernatorial nominee Terry McAuliffe the left-wing Washington Post wants to have it both ways. In an article published Friday the Post tries to mitigate the damage President Obama’s new strict carbon emission limits will have on the McAuliffe campaign by also putting a pox on Republican nominee Cuccinelli’s house over bizarrely DC’s ongoing budget battles.But as hard as the Post might try there is just no comparing the latest round of federal budget battles to the effect Obama’s war on coal will have on Virginia and working class Virginians.At the bottom of its article the Post is eventually forced to admit that the Cuccinnelli campaign — if not the man himself — actually did comment on the possibility of a government shutdown:“It’s pretty rich that in the same week it was revealed that Terry McAuliffe wants to shut down Virginia’s government he’s now focused on whether the federal government is going to do the same” Cullen said referring to remarks by McAuliffe that he would not sign a budget as governor if it did not include funds for expanding Medicaid. “No one wants to see the federal government shut down period. Ken Cuccinelli is not running for Congress he’s running for governor. . . . Ken Cuccinelli would more than welcome a debate with Terry McAuliffe on the issue of Obamacare.”Fast Terry however has yet to stand up for the state’s southwest coal country and who knows how many middle class jobs. Instead of staking a position one way or another the McAuliffe campaign punted with a statement that tries to please everyone and promises to take a position sometime in the future:Terry agrees with the broad swath of scientists economists and military leaders who view climate change as a looming problem for Virginia” campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin wrote in an e-mail. “While he agrees that there needs to be some limit on carbon pollution and believes that Virginia can and should lead the way in building new plants that create low-cost low-carbon energy he looks forward to further reviewing the President’s proposed rules in detail and studying their impact on Virginia’s economy.”Cuccinnelli was quick to jump on the Obama administration:“The administration renewed its war on coal today” Cuccinelli said adding — as he often does — that “a war on coal is a war on the poor” and that Virginia “needs a governor who’ll fight for those folks” who depend on the coal industry.It is doubtful Virginia voters will care one or another if a potential governor chooses to focus on his state as opposed to the latest drama unfurling in the nation’s capitol. These new carbon emission controls however directly affect the state and thousands of Virginia jobs.Instead of choosing a position McAuliffe is likely hoping to dither through the last five weeks left in the campaign. And as we have already seen the Washington Post will be right there to hold his hand.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC,1
683,In a classic tale illustrating the “law of unintended consequences” a new report concludes that President Barack Obama’s $3 billion “Cash for Clunkers” taxpayer-funded boondoggle artificially drove car prices up not down and unleashed an “environmental nightmare” through shredding not recycling many of the 690000 cars people traded in for an up to $4500 car credit.In 2009 Mr. Obama proudly declared that his Cash for Clunkers program officially known as the Car Allowance Rebate System (CARS) was a stunning success. “There were skeptics who weren’t sure that this ‘Cash for Clunkers’ program would work” said Mr. Obama. “But I’m happy to report that it has succeeded well beyond our expectations and all expectations and we’re already seeing a dramatic increase in showroom traffic at local car dealers…So I’m very pleased with the progress that’s been made in the House today on the “Cash for Clunkers” program.”But as Yahoo News notes the program’s decision to shred not recycle many of the trade-in vehicles unleashed an “environmental nightmare”:Shredding vehicles results in its own environmental nightmare. For each ton of metal produced by a shredding facility roughly 500 pounds of “shredding residue” is also produced which includes polyurethane foams metal oxides glass and dirt. All totaled about 4.5 million tons of that residue is already produced on average every year. Where does it go? Right into a landfill. E Magazine states recycling just the plastic and metal alone from the CARS scraps would have saved 24 million barrels of oil. While some of the “Clunkers” were truly old many of the almost 700000 cars were still in perfectly good condition. In fact many that qualified for the program were relatively “young” with fuel efficiencies that rivaled newer cars.A study conducted by Resources for the Future further underscored the program’s failure economically and environmentally:Approximately 45 percent of the spending went to consumers who would have purchased a new vehicle anyway. Our results suggest no gain in sales beyond 2009 and hence no meaningful stimulus to the economy. In addition the program will reduce CO2 emissions by only 9 to 28.4 million tons implying a cost per ton ranging from $91 to $288 even after accounting for reduced criteria pollutants.And E–The Environmental Magazine says the Department of Transportation’s declaration that Cash for Clunkers was a success is simply a case of smoke and mirrors:The Department of Transportation reported that Cash for Clunkers was an environmental success…In general drivers traded in inefficient SUVs and trucks for more efficient passenger cars. However it’s quite easy to negate this small difference in gas mileage purely by the fact that people will be more likely to drive a vehicle that takes less money to fill up with gas. It’s an efficiency paradox: as we get more efficient at using energy the overall cost of energy goes down but we respond by using more of it. Auto emissions of carbon dioxide are directly proportional to gasoline consumed. With only 690000 fuel-efficient vehicles purchased and over 250 million cars registered in the U.S. that is a negligible difference in overall greenhouse gas emissions.As the Washington Post even conceded Mr. Obama’s Cash for Clunkers scheme was an economic and environmental failure: “So were the naysayers right?” asked the Post. “It seems so.”,1

Jerry Brown’s income-tax hike on the state’s highest earners that has some vowing to leave.“The Monterey Shale could be a boon to the economy but there’s heavy emphasis on the word ‘could’ ” said Jason Marshall chief deputy director for the state’s Department of Conservation.Geoffrey Styles energy consultant recently wrote in the online forum The Energy Collective that drilling the formation “could slash California's imports while adding billions of dollars a year to the local economy and to the shaky state budget along with lots of good jobs.”Oil production in the region is still largely in the speculation or developmental phases. Oil companies purportedly have been working the region’s complex structure since the early 1990s but only recently have new technologies made large-scale extractions economically possible.Environmentalists are primarily opposed to the companies having to tap the estimated 15. 4 billion barrels in the Monterey Shale by deep horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing which has helped drive the country’s recent shale oil and gas boom but also raised environmental worries.They also argue such techniques will be especially tricky in that region considering its complex geological formation created in part by the San Andreas fault.“There are some really serious concerns for California” said Kassie Siegel a lawyer for the Center for Biological Diversity.She said two of the group’s biggest worries are the potential to trigger an earthquake and water contamination consider that fracking includes injecting a mix of water sand and chemicals into rock to release oil or natural gas.She said fracking uses millions of gallons of water in a state “starved for water” and the latest methods use “slick water” that includes hundreds of potential harmful chemicals.“There are many many aspects to the water issue” Siegel said. “And California is a very seismically active area.”Oil companies have engaged in fracking in California for decades without heavy monitoring by state regulators. But that situation appears to be swiftly changing with the state releasing a draft of fracking rules in December with plans to have a complete set of regulations within the year Marshall told FoxNews.com.He also acknowledged the importance of oil in the state economy pointing out that California in 2011 produced nearly 197 million barrels. But he also expressed Brown administration concerns similar to those of the environmentalists -- protecting state resources and whether fracking will work in the already-fractured formation.“It may take (more) advancement in technology or methodology to unlock the oil-production potential of the formation” Marshall said.To be sure California already has a long boom-to-bust history with oil that started in 1865 with a discovery east of San Francisco and includes the great boom of 1894 around Los Angeles.Though the state is still the country’s fourth-largest oil producer -- behind Texas North Dakota and Alaska -- production has declined since roughly the mid-1980s.Occidental Petroleum and Venoco are already working the Monterey Shale region with Hess Corp. purportedly among the other major oil companies making a foray – amid a real estate boom and middlemen snapping up leases for acres held by the Bureau of Land Management.“We’ve seen a significant increase in the last three to five years in the price paid from our sales” said Gabriel Garcia a field manager at the agency’s Bakersfield office recently told The New York Times. “Some of that has to do with speculation on new technologies and some of that has to do with the high price of oil.”,1
685,Climate change:By Neela BanerjeeAdvertisementWASHINGTON -- In his State of the Union address President Obama articulated a subtle but noticeable shift away from his longstanding discussion of climate change in almost entirely economic terms to making a moral argument for the need to act.“For the sake of our children and our future” he said “we must do more to combat climate change.”Advertisement“Yes it’s true that no single event makes a trend” Obama said. “But the fact is the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15. Heat waves droughts wildfires and floods -- all are now more frequent and intense. We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy and the most severe drought in decades and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence. Or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science -- and act before it’s too late.”His new blunter language on climate change builds on rhetoric he used during the Democratic National Convention in his election night victory speech and his Inaugural address three weeks ago. Obama did not follow up his mention of climate change by unveiling any new major initiatives. But he told legislators that with or without them he would act on it.Advertisement“I urge this Congress to pursue a bipartisan market-based solution to climate change like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago” Obama said speaking of the Senate veterans. “But if Congress won’t act soon to protect future generations I will. I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take now and in the future to reduce pollution prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy.”The president has public opinion on his side with polls late last year showing that a majority of Americans now consider climate change a serious problem. He also has initiatives at the ready that were being crafted toward the end of his first term most notably rules to curtail greenhouse gas emissions from new power plants.AdvertisementEnvironmentalists praised Obama’s new approach but key decisions ahead are likely to test his commitment. Environmentalists hope to see the administration reject the building of the Keystone XL pipeline which they say would amp up greenhouse gases. They also expect the Environmental Protection Agency to push new rules to cut emissions of greenhouse gases from existing power plants.“He was strong on problems but weak on solutions after saying climate change was a moral crisis and an economic opportunity” said Michael Brune president of the Sierra Club. “He didn’t give us much to chew on as far as meeting the challenge.”AdvertisementMinimum wage:By Jim PuzzangheraWASHINGTON -- President Obama focused his State of the Union address on boosting the nation’s slow-moving economic recovery saying the first priority “is making America a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing.”AdvertisementObama unveiled some new initiatives such as raising the minimum wage opening new government-backed Manufacturing Innovation Institutes and a program to fix crumbling infrastructure.He also pushed lawmakers to approve proposals that stalled in Congress last year including making it easier for some homeowners to refinance their mortgages eliminating some corporate tax breaks and enacting the so-called Buffett Rule to ensure that millionaires pay a minimum income tax rate.Advertisement“Now is our best chance for bipartisan comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit” Obama said. “The American people deserve a tax code that helps small businesses spend less time filling out complicated forms and more time expanding and hiring.”The most significant new proposal was to raise the national minimum wage in stages to $9 an hour by 2015 from $7.25 and to tie the rate to inflation.Advertisement“This single step would raise the income of millions of working families” Obama said. “For businesses across the country it would mean customers with more money in their pockets.”Obama also proposed a $50-billion program called “Fix-It-First” that would hire people to repair nearly 70000 structurally deficient bridges nationwide and other infrastructure.AdvertisementIn addition the president said he would use existing money to open three new Manufacturing Innovation Institutes after the success of the first such facility in Youngstown Ohio where an unused warehouse has been converted into a state-of-the art 3D printing lab. Obama called for Congress to authorize $1 billion to create a network of 15 such institutes.Gun control:By Melanie MasonWASHINGTON — Much of President Obama’s rhetoric on gun violence in his State of the Union address focused on a seemingly basic appeal to Congress: hold a vote.AdvertisementHis repeated refrain that victims of gun violence “deserve a vote” served as the speech’s emotional crescendo. But it also underscored just how daunting is the legislative path facing gun control. Congress has not held floor votes on major changes to gun laws since the 1990s.Obama made cursory mentions of the components of his gun policy proposals: universal background checks a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and stronger anti-trafficking laws.Advertisement“Each of these proposals deserves a vote in Congress. If you want to vote no that’s your choice” Obama said. “But these proposals deserve a vote. Because in the two months since Newtown more than a thousand birthdays graduations and anniversaries have been stolen from our lives by a bullet from a gun.”One of those lives he noted was that of Hadiya Pendleton a 15-year-old who marched in his inaugural parade last month. One week later she was killed in Chicago an unintended victim of gun violence.Advertisement“Hadiya’s parents Nate and Cleo are in this chamber tonight along with more than two dozen Americans whose lives have been torn apart by gun violence. They deserve a vote” Obama said.Her parents sitting next to First Lady Michelle Obama listened somberly. Hadiya’s mother Cleopatra Cowley-Pendleton flashed a brief smile at the president’s mention of her daughter’s love of Fig Newtons and lip gloss.AdvertisementThe president continued: “Gabby Giffords deserves a vote. The families of Newtown deserve a vote. The families of Aurora deserve a vote. The families of Oak Creek and Tucson and Blacksburg and the countless other communities ripped open by gun violence – they deserve a simple vote.”The chorus was picked up by lawmakers mostly Democrats who chanted “vote vote.” Many in the hall in both parties wore green ribbons in show of support for Newtown Conn. the site of a mass shooting at an elementary school in December.AdvertisementA number of Democratic lawmakers also invited victims of gun violence and their loved ones as guests. Rep. Janice Hahn (D-San Pedro) brought the Rev. E. Winford Bell a Los Angeles-based Baptist pastor who founded a faith-based anti-violence organization after his son was injured in a 2009 shooting. Hahn said Bell and others could prod her colleagues in Congress to act.“Sometimes the president will have one issue and he’ll have one person in the gallery stand up” Hahn said. “This time there [are] a lot of people who are guests who have suffered from gun violence. And I think that is a powerful message and voice for Congress.”AdvertisementJob creation through minimum wage hikes:By Don LeeWASHINGTON -- Many mom-and-pop businesses were among the most vocal critics of President Obama’s healthcare overhaul as being too costly and now they’re likely to howl at his latest proposal: an increase in the federal minimum wage.But the proposal drew immediate praise from unions and worker advocacy groups. And the idea is likely to find support from many newly hired workers in this tough recovery.AdvertisementSince early 2010 when the economy began to create jobs about one-third of the 6 million private-sector jobs added to the economy have been in three sectors that pay relatively low wages: restaurants retail trade and temporary help.Obama in his state of the union message called for a boost in the minimum pay rate to $9 an hour from the current $7.25 and to tie that to a cost of living increase saying that “in the wealthiest nation on Earth no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty.”A single person who works full-time today in a minimum-wage job would gross about $15100 which is above the federal poverty line. Congress last passed a minimum-wage increase in 2007 and Obama noted that since then 19 states had bumped up their minimum hourly pay rates.In reviving a proposal that he made as a presidential candidate in 2008 Obama probably got strong support from his chief economic advisor Alan Krueger whose research findings have poked holes in the commonly held view that increasing the minimum wage leads to higher joblessness.AdvertisementStill the president’s new push for a minimum wage increase is likely to draw fire from many who believe it will hurt the economy especially small businesses which as a whole have lagged behind in growth and hiring during this recovery.Immigration reform:By Brian BennettAdvertisementWASHINGTON – President Obama pressed Congress to overhaul immigration laws “in the next few months” during his State of the Union speech but he did not dwell on the issue a signal that he doesn’t want to upset delicate negotiations unfolding in the House and the Senate.“Let’s get this done” Obama said several times as the chamber cheered. “Send me a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the next few months and I will sign it right away.”AdvertisementMarshall Fitz an immigration expert at the Center for American Progress a liberal think tank said Obama wanted to give Congress time to negotiate and draft a bill.“There’s an awareness on his part that too much involvement can hurt the process” he said.AdvertisementObama wove his immigration remarks into his larger proposals to stimulate the economy and create jobs. He emphasized that prominent business and labor leaders have said “the time has come” to pass an immigration bill.Obama repeated his call for a bill that includes additional border security measures and creates a pathway to “earned” citizenship for those who pass a law enforcement check pay back taxes and a penalty and learn English.AdvertisementThe effort to forge a compromise has tacit support from Republican leaders in Congress who see reaching out to Latino families as important for the future of the GOP. But some Republicans are staunchly opposed to expanding legal immigration and are unlikely to agree to offering legal status to illegal immigrants.“If the president was serious about creating jobs and spurring economic growth amnesty for illegal immigrants would not be on his agenda” Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas) said in a statement Tuesday.AdvertisementSmith who has voted to reduce legal immigration levels for more than two decades said the president’s proposal which Obama outlined in a Jan. 29 speech in Las Vegas “will make it easier for 11 million illegal immigrants to compete with hard-pressed American workers.”Efforts to hammer out a compromise have accelerated in both the House and the Senate in recent weeks.AdvertisementIn the Senate a bipartisan group of four Democrats and four Republicans has begun meeting twice a week. Aides are drafting a bill that includes a route to legal status and more visas for highly skilled or highly educated applicants.The Democrats – Sen. Charles E. Schumer of New York Richard J. Durbin of Illinois Bob Menendez of New Jersey and Michael Bennet of Colorado – are scheduled to meet Obama on Wednesday afternoon to brief him on the group’s progress.AdvertisementObama has said he wants to see the Senate introduce an immigration reform bill next month. If he doesn’t he has promised to send his own version to the Senate and ask the chamber to vote on it. Activists say that could poison the spirit of cooperation now underway.Obama has been “really clear… that he’s not going to wait forever” said Fitz who was in a group of immigration advocates and labor leaders who met with the president in the West Wing last week. “This isn’t going to get dragged into a back room and be allowed to die a slow and ugly death.”AdvertisementEducational programs:By Howard BlumePresident Obama focused Tuesday night on the ends of the education spectrum — preschool and college. He said in his State of the Union address that his administration would work with states to provide a high-quality preschool program for all. He said only 3 of 10 children currently enroll in such programs which he said were proven to increase graduation rates and reduce teen pregnancy rates and violent crime.AdvertisementThere has been controversy however over the success of federally funded Head Start programs which critics have said are not of consistently high quality. There’s also a persistent debate over whether early childhood programs should focus on academic skills or developing creativity and social skills. Either way the president is likely to meet with resistance if a preschool initiative means a substantial new outlay of federal funds.Obama also compared American high school graduates with their German peers who he said can leave high school with the equivalent of a community college degree. Obama was not specific about how he would accomplish the same in the United States although he said there are model programs in this country to emulate.AdvertisementOne of his most interesting and specific proposals dealt with colleges.“Colleges must do their part to keep costs down” Obama said echoing campaign themes voiced by himself and Republican opponent Mitt Romney during the presidential race.AdvertisementOn Tuesday Obama said he wanted to link federal funding to the affordability and value a college offers. And he said the administration is prepared to roll out a score card listing which schools do and do not offer the most “bang for the educational buck.”Follow Politics Now on Twitter and Facebook,0
686,"Even before President Barack Obama unveiled his sweeping climate change plan on Tuesday Republican leaders were denouncing the effort as a job-killer. Any move to restrict polluting carbon dioxide emissions from power plants they maintained would send energy costs up and lead to mass layoffs in a vital job sector.At a press conference last Thursday House Majority Leader John Boehner (R-Ohio) blasted the expected proposal as “absolutely crazy.”“Why would you want to increase the cost of energy and kill more American jobs at a time when the American people are still asking where are the jobs?” he asked.But experts who have studied the intersection of environmental policy and the job market say there's little truth to this claim if any.Such assertions are ""wildly overstated"" said Richard Revesz the director of the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University. He framed Boehner's remark as the latest iteration of a “job-killer meme” that has surfaced frequently in recent years as Republicans have sought to drum up fears about Obama’s environmental efforts.“We hear often that large swaths of the economy will be wiped out due to one regulation or another” Revesz said. “Fortunately and not surprisingly we don't see those predictions coming true.”In a comprehensive 2012 review of more than 25 studies that attempted to gauge the effect of environmental regulations on jobs a team of researchers led by Revesz found that many claims about such regulations were unreliable.While studies commissioned by the coal industry warned that millions of jobs could be lost others conducted by left-leaning think tanks and environmental groups predicted that millions of jobs would be gained their survey found.By contrast the most detailed studies concluded that job losses and gains from environmental regulations essentially balanced out. ""When serious studies have been done the impacts tend to be small -- sometimes positive sometimes negative but small"" Revesz said.Obama said Tuesday that he would use his executive powers to place limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. The plan is the most ambitious effort by a U.S. president to address climate change to date and includes $8 billion in loan guarantees for clean energy projects such as efforts to trap and store carbon dioxide emitted by coal-burning power plants.One company that stands to benefit from the plan is Neumann Systems Group based in Colorado Springs Colo. The company recently won a $73.5 million contract to apply its liquid-based emissions scrubbing technology to a local power plant that is under construction. Todd Tiahrt Neumann's CEO said the technology could also be used to retrofit older plants at a cost of about $150 million for an average-sized facility.Tiahrt said he expected Obama's proposal would spur growth in his field and that in five years his operation could employ 500 engineers. But he also worried that new regulations would single out coal plants for closure even though they are hardly the only carbon polluters.""My initial reaction is this amounts to an unfair segregation of the coal industry"" he said.Coal plants are still proliferating across the world Tiahrt said and any initiative to curb their use in the United States would also inhibit the growth of businesses like his that are developing methods to make coal clean.Perhaps sensing this paradox Democrats seem to be pulling back on their attempts to directly counter Republicans' jobs fears and portray climate regulations as boons to the job market.The policy paper that accompanied Obama's announcement mentions potential job growth stemming from the proposed measures six separate times but it avoids any specifics such as what types of jobs might be created and in which industries.Indeed the only specific job-growth number in the report refers to an ""estimated"" 17000 jobs created at 50 solar and wind farms and geothermal plants approved by the Department of Energy since 2009.This reluctance to be predictive could be a sign the administration wants to bury a boast Obama made while on the campaign trail in 2008. If elected president he pledged he would invest in green-energy technology that would yield 5 million jobs.The best opportunity at realizing that goal came in 2009 when the massive stimulus approved by Congress provided $90 billion in loans tax credits and other measures for increasing clean energy production and bolstering public transit.Even the most vocal supporters of the stimulus acknowledge that the investment didn't create many jobs. Robert Pollin a former Energy Department official who was tasked with tabulating jobs stemming from the stimulus said his ""best guess"" is that 240000 green jobs were created from 2009 to 2011.But while those green-energy efforts may not have boosted the job market they weren't job-killers either Revesz noted. And all things considered he said Obama's newly proposed climate rules are likely to do more good than harm.""With the health benfits and environmental benefits are strong as they are it's really clear to us that we as a nation are better off with these regulations"" he said.",0
687,"8 years ago(CNN) - Call it the bromance part two.President Barack Obama and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie team up Tuesday to survey recovery efforts along the Jersey shore seven months after Superstorm Sandy slammed into the Garden State and neighboring New York causing billions in damage.The destructive storm hit the northeast just over a week before last November's presidential election forcing both Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney to put their campaigns on hold briefly while the heavily-populated region recovered.The president traveled to New Jersey a few days after Sandy hit to observe federal recovery efforts touring the damage with Christie who at the time was a top Romney surrogate.Standing next to the president Christie praised Obama saying ""I cannot thank the president enough for his personal concern and compassion for our state and for the people of our state.""Some political pundits say that the storm which put the campaign on hold and the federal government's response to the storm were a couple of the many contributing factors that helped the president win re-election just a few days later. While Christie's own approval rating in New Jersey soared after Sandy and has remained high to date as he runs for re-election this year some commentators in his own party blasted him for his praise of Obama.“He’s fat and a fool. Don’t listen to Governor Christie. He doesn’t know what he’s talking about” said conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh.Christie himself dismissed the critics saying his actions after the storm weren't in any way motivated by politics – including a potential bid for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination. He reiterated that mindset last week saying on NBC's ""Today"" he wasn't worried about how Obama's visit might affect his political future.""If the president wants to come back here and see the progress himself I never worry about that stuff"" Christie said Friday morning."" ""I worry about doing my job.""""The bottom line is you can't experience the way you're experiencing it right now unless you're here and you see it for yourself"" Christie added. ""The fact of the matter is he's president of the United States and if he wants to see the people of New Jersey I'm the governor and I'll be here to welcome him.""Christie political adviser Mike DuHaime said the governor was putting his constituents' needs ahead of partisan politics.""Governor Christie has always put the best interests of the people who elected him first well ahead of any political calculations"" DuHaime said. ""If some people do not agree with putting your constituents first in a time of crisis and natural disaster then so be it. He will always put the people who elected him first.""In New Jersey Obama and Christie will tour areas hit hard by last year's storm which caused an estimated $38 billion in damage to the Garden State. Hundreds of thousands of homes were either damaged or destroyed with many ocean-front businesses also sustaining significant harm from the high winds and storm surge.Those businesses on the Jersey Shore are still working to recover at the beginning of the busy summer tourist season which in years past has brought billions of dollars in revenue to the state.Millions have been spent rebuilding boardwalks and restoring destroyed businesses but thinner crowds are expected this summer as towns continue to work toward getting back to normal.In Asbury Park the iconic hometown of Bruce Springsteen Obama will deliver remarks and ""highlight the extensive rebuilding efforts to date"" the White House said.They added Obama will ""underscore his administration's ongoing commitment to stand with the impacted communities as the important work of recovery continues.""""It's a pretty vivid illustration about the president's commitment to seeing these things through"" deputy press secretary Josh Earnest said Sunday.""The president made a promise in the aftermath of that storm that he would continue to focus on that recovery effort and that the federal government would continue to focus on that recovery effort long after the nation's attention or at least the media's attention had turned elsewhere"" Earnest added.Even as Christie enjoys a healthy lead over his Democratic rival in this year's governor's race many wonder how his public embrace of Obama - both last fall and now - will affect his presidential chances in 2016. Christie who has said he's not interested in running for president is nonetheless widely speculated to be a potential candidate.Rich Galen a GOP political analyst who advised Fred Thompson during his 2008 presidential bid said Christie has a number of ""institutional problems"" aside from his relationship with Obama. He hails from the East Coast and doesn't particularly align with the GOP's major factions.""That being said if it looks two years down the road like he can win and no one else can all else will be forgiven"" Galen said. ""Obama's not running again but Christie is so I suspect that other than the ideologues he'll be fine.""""Republicans are still furious at Governor Christie but not as mad as they are at President Obama"" noted GOP strategist Alex Castellanos. ""If Christie demonstrates that he can wrest the White House back for Republicans and reverse the leftward shift of Obama's 8 years many Republicans will forgive his sins.""Tuesday's trip will mark the second time in just three days Obama has traveled to the site of a natural disaster – he toured tornado-inflicted damage in Moore Oklahoma on Sunday and encouraged further Congressional support for programs that bolster emergency management systems for municipalities.""Training education both for citizenry but also for first responders is absolutely critical"" Obama said. ""And we've got to make sure that those resources remain in place. So I know everybody in Congress cares deeply about what's happening and I'm confident that resources will be forthcoming when it comes to rebuilding.""Obama praised the Federal Emergency Management Agency for its quick response to the Moore tornado just as he did last fall when Sandy struck the East Coast. Long the object of scorn for its missteps in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina FEMA has been commended by localities for responding quickly to disasters and reducing some of the bureaucratic hurdles of the past.",0
688,"President Obama's pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency is already running into resistance from the fossil fuel industry over concerns that she would escalate a ""war"" on oil coal and natural gas.EPA veteran Gina McCarthy was one of three nominees Obama announced at the White House late Monday morning. He also tapped MIT scientist Ernest Moniz to head the Energy Department and Walmart's Sylvia Mathews Burwell as his next budget chief.All will have to undergo Senate confirmation. And McCarthy -- given her background and the controversial nature of the agency she wants to lead -- could face the toughest screening.""Today's announcement that the president wants Gina McCarthy to serve as the next EPA administrator is a clear indication that the administration will continue a war on affordable energy"" Thomas Pyle president of the Institute for Energy Research said in a statement.""Throughout her career McCarthy has implemented policies that attempt to constrain the use of reliable energy sources. ... It appears the president is rewarding these efforts by increasing her ability to implement an ideological and political agenda.

James Inhofe R-Okla. said the nomination makes clear that Obama ""wants to continue pursuing an aggressive climate agenda at EPA.""Environmental and air quality advocates though credit McCarthy with helping implement rules that could curb everything from asthma attacks to heart attacks.Obama described McCarthy as someone who could balance smart environmental regulation and economic growth. He said that at the EPA so far she has pursued ""practical cost-effective ways to keep our air clean and our economy growing.""""She has earned a reputation as a straight-shooter"" Obama said Monday. ""I'm confident that she is going to do an outstanding job.""The nominations Monday preceded Obama's first Cabinet meeting of his second term. They also signal that the White House is trying to get back to normal business after the president and Congress failed to avert the $85 billion in automatic spending cuts that started taking effect Friday.

She currently runs the Walmart Foundation the retail giant's philanthropic wing and previously served as president of the Gates Foundation's Global Development Program.The White House official credited Burwell with being a principal architect of a series of budget plans in the 1990s that led to a budget surplus.Walmart president Mike Duke called Burwell a strong leader with a ""clear vision for making big things happen.""""She understands business and the role that business government and civil society must play to build a strong economy that provides opportunity and strengthens communities across the country"" Duke said in a statement.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",0
689,President Barack Obama will deliver a speech at Georgetown University Tuesday afternoon in which he will call for new regulations aimed at restricting carbon dioxide emissions from existing coal-fired power plants not just new ones. Previously Obama had aimed regulations at new coal plants. Shares of U.S. coal stocks plummeted ahead of the speech though the Washington Post suggested global market turmoil played a role.The Obama administration has been uniquely hostile to coal and other fossil fuels despite the fact that the rapid expansion of natural gas development through “fracking” and oil production from shale deposits has driven much of the growth that the U.S. economy has mustered during his presidency. Permits for oil and gas exploration and development on federal land have slowed; offshore oil and gas activity has been blocked especially after the Deepwater Horizon spill of 2010 even in defiance of the courts; and the Environmental Protection Agency has pushed new emissions rules despite Congress’s refusal to pass a cap-and-trade bill.Obama has long singled out coal in particular. In January 2008 as he sought to outflank rival presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on the left then-Sen. Obama promised to “bankrupt” new coal plants. His administration issued heavy-handed new regulations on coal forcing many plants out of production. And his left-wing supporters in Hollywood have cheered him on encouraging him to bypass Congress far from the job losses that will occur. Politicians of both parties in coal-producing state have protested to little avail.Earlier this week seven governors wrote to the president to urge him to stop new EPA regulations on the new source performance standard (NSPS) for new coal power plants arguing that they would cause plants to be shuttered and pointing out the industry’s own progress on reducing emissions. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett (R) was one of the seven and wrote to the president: “It is imperative that abundant natural resources such as coal continue to be available to meet our base load electricity needs. I am convinced that we can achieve this goal while lowering emissions. Significant technological advancements in generating plant efficiency and emission capture and reduction are within reach but need regulatory flexibility that does not discriminate against our own home-grown energy resources if they are to be achieved.”Nevertheless Obama is expected to announce an expansion of regulations. The New York Times reported last week that the president would seek to apply regulations to existing coal plants as well as new ones.In his speech at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin Germany last week President Obama warned of the need to take action against “coastlines that vanish oceans that rise”–an echo of his much-lampooned 2008 speech in Minneapolis upon winning the Democratic nomination in which he said that he was “absolutely certain” that future generations would remember his nomination and anticipated victory as the moment that “when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.”For Obama and his most radical supporters that moment was much delayed–perhaps until today.,1
690,WASHINGTON — The Obama administration is considering a sweeping initiative to address climate change including the first-ever limits on carbon dioxide from power plants the country’s biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions according to people familiar with the discussions.The White House has yet to settle on specific measures but “we’re hearing that existing power plants are definitely in the mix” said a person with knowledge of the deliberations who like others asked not to be identified to talk about White House discussions. An announcement could come by mid-July.AdvertisementPower plants account for about a third of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions with most of the carbon dioxide coming from coal-fired plants and to a lesser extent natural gas generation. Issuing rules to curtail their pollution would almost certainly touch off a battle in the courts and Congress.“There are only a few substantive meaningful actions the administration can take short of dealing with existing power plants” said S. William Becker executive director of the National Assn. of Clean Air Agencies a group of local and state air pollution regulators. “So I’d be extremely surprised if existing power plants weren’t one of the top priorities the administration is pursuing.”AdvertisementThe White House declined to comment on the deliberations instead citing President Obama’s past comments on climate change. The Edison Electric Institute the power industry’s trade group also declined to comment.Still Heather Zichal White House deputy assistant for energy and climate change said at an environmental conference in Washington last week that “in the coming weeks and months you can expect to hear more from the president on this issue.”AdvertisementAt the start of his second term Obama identified climate change as one of his top priorities along with immigration and the federal deficit. But then the administration appeared to pull back. Long-awaited final rules to limit greenhouse gases from new power plants have been delayed and the White House has been silent on any plan to control emissions from existing power plants.But in recent weeks the administration has begun to move on its climate agenda. Most notably Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced recently that the countries would phase down and eventually halt the production and use of hydrofluorocarbons potent heat-trapping gases used as chemical refrigerants in air conditioners and other appliances. The United States and China now plan to work to get other countries in particular India to join the effort.AdvertisementThree years ago Obama pledged that the U.S. would lower its greenhouse gas emissions to 17% less than 2005 levels by 2020. The administration’s fuel economy rules for motor vehicles have helped rein in emissions. Carbon dioxide output has also fallen because the economy slowed and cleaner-burning natural gas plants are replacing coal-fired plants. Yet the U.S. cannot meet that target without enacting new regulations or laws according to analysts and regulators.Republican lawmakers have largely rejected the idea that human activity has caused climate change precluding the chance of passing new legislation. As a result the administration has to act on its own.AdvertisementRep. Edward Whitfield (R-Ky.) chairman of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on energy and power could not be reached for comment.But to make a deep dent in carbon dioxide emissions the administration would have to tackle the politically touchy subject of power plants. Any rule issued by the Environmental Protection Agency would no doubt trigger a lawsuit by opponents. Congress could also try to attach riders to spending bills that would stop funding for greenhouse gas standards said Daniel J.

The states would have to enforce the standards. The EPA could work with states to set up target reductions of greenhouse gases for each state. A state with many coal plants such as Ohio might not be able to meet its target as fast as a state such as Washington which relies greatly on hydroelectricity.Environmentalists and regulators said a new climate initiative might contain energy efficiency programs and efforts to eliminate leaks of methane another potent greenhouse gas from oil and gas drilling operations and pipelines.Advertisement“This is an important issue to the president.

692,"California is sitting on a massive amount of shale oil and could become the next oil boom state. But only if the industry can get the stuff out of the ground without upsetting the state's powerful environmental lobby.Running from Los Angeles to San Francisco California's Monterey Shale is thought to contain more oil than North Dakota's Bakken and Texas's Eagle Ford -- both scenes of an oil boom that's created thousands of jobs and boosted U.S. oil production to the highest rate in over a decade.In fact the Monterey is thought to hold over 400 billion barrels of oil according to IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates. That's nearly half the conventional oil in all of Saudi Arabia. The United States consumes about 19 million barrels of oil a day.""Four hundred billion barrels that doesn't escape anyone in this businesses"" said Stephen Trammel energy research director at IHS.The trick now is getting it out.Related: World's 10 biggest energy projectsAs a result of the San Andres fault California's geologic layers are folded like an accordion rather than simply stacked on top of each other like they are in other Shale states. The folds have naturally cracked the shale rock and much of California's current ""conventional"" oil production -- the third largest in the nation -- is thought to come from the Monterey.But the folds mean recent advancements that have made shale oil and gas profitable to extract -- horizontal drilling combined with hydraulic fracturing -- don't work as well in California. It's hard to drill horizontally if the shale is not flat.Plus it appears the Monterey is made up of shale rock that doesn't respond as well to hydraulic fracturing -- the controversial practice known as fracking that involves injecting water sand and chemicals into the ground under high pressure to crack the rock and allow the oil and gas to flow.Still the U.S. Energy Information Agency estimates there are over 15 billion barrels of oil that can be recovered using today's technology.""That's a huge number"" said Matt Woodson an analyst at the energy research firm Wood Mackenzie. Woodson said the 15 billion number far exceeds current estimates for North Dakota's Bakken Shale and is about half the amount held in Alaska's North Slope before it was tapped.That potential has attracted the attention of the oil industry.Several oil companies have put together research teams to work on the Monterey said Katie Potter head of exploration and production staffing at NES Global Talent a company that recruits oil industry professionals.If the Monterey takes off Potter said the impact on jobs in the state would be huge saying the shale boom has already created 600000 jobs nationwide over the last few years.""It could potentially solve the state's budget deficit"" she said.Related: U.S. to become biggest oil producer -- IEALast month the government held a lease sale to drill in the Monterey. While only a modest 18000 acres were offered they were all snapped up.Occidental (OXY) which is California-based and has long held acres in the Monterey has had some success using a technology known as deep acid injection said IHS's Trammel.The process involves injecting hydrofluoric or other acids deep underground where they eat away at the shale rock and allow the oil to flow. It's cheaper than fracking said Trammel. And while it sounds ominous it may not be as controversial as the volumes involved are far less and it's not done under such pressure he said.Still no matter how the oil is produced environmentalists in the Golden State are keeping close watch.Fracking could still become an issue as it has in other states where it's led to fears over groundwater contamination said Nathan Matthews a Sierra Club attorney based in San Francisco. And there's no guarantee acid injection is much better.Plus there's air pollution road congestion and other issues that go along with an oil boom.Matthews wants California regulators to require full disclosure of everything the oil industry is putting in the ground as well as individual permits issued for each well drilled.""There's a chance to get this done much better than where it's been done elsewhere"" said Matthews. ""We need to understand the risks before we open the flood gate.""Regulations or not there's still no guarantee there will be an oil boom at all.""It might not live up to its expectations"" said Fadel Gheit a senior energy analyst at Oppenheimer. ""The industry has not concluded whether it's boom or bust.""But given the rapid advances over the last few years in oil drilling and producing technology the smart money may be on boom.""There are some pretty creative people in this industry"" said Trammel. ""I'd say they are going to figure it out.""",1
693,Many experts have found evidence of a strong correlation between tolerance and prosperity particularly in high-tech sectors. One of them the author Richard Florida has identified the “three T’s” — talent technology and tolerance — as the fundamental basis for the growth of new economies.With a high concentration of outstanding colleges and universities Rhode Island certainly has the talent. The technology is there as well with our state’s broadband speed and coverage ranked among the nation’s best. The Beacon Hill Institute’s most recent State Competitiveness Report also placed Rhode Island fifth among all states in the technology category. Now we are poised to adopt the third and final T: tolerance.The point is not simply that we are welcoming to gay people though we are. It is that we want to welcome everyone. The talented workers who are driving the new economy — young educated and forward-looking — want to live in a place that reflects their values. They want diversity not simply out of a sense of justice but because diversity makes life more fun. Why would any state turn away the people who are most likely to create the economies of the 21st century?I have been heartened in recent months to see members of my old party coming around on marriage equality including the entire Republican caucus in the Rhode Island Senate — the first time a caucus of either party has been unanimous in its support. That reflects sound political judgment and some values that are at least as Republican as they are Democratic including a belief in marriage as an institution and a desire to keep government out of our personal lives.The push for equality will continue to grow stronger in statehouses courthouses and polling places in every state in America. This is by and large a generational issue not a geographic one. Even in the reddest states the rising generations are far more tolerant than their parents and grandparents. As this shift continues marriage equality will inevitably become law in more and more states. The states that cling to their old prohibitions will then be viewed as the outliers. Like Rhode Island in recent years they will be seen as islands of old thinking.This is also true more broadly at the national level. The United States is at a competitive disadvantage in attracting skilled workers to fill high-level jobs in technology finance and health care as noted by industry leaders and Wall Street executives at Monday’s annual “Out on the Street” conference. It is my hope that the Supreme Court will choose to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act and that my fellow governors will lobby their Congressional delegations to address our country’s discriminatory policies at the federal level.So tomorrow when I sign the Marriage Equality Act into law I will be thinking of the Rhode Islanders who have fought for decades simply to be able to marry the person they love. I will be thinking of how Rhode Island is upholding its legacy as a place founded on the principles of tolerance and diversity. But I will also be thinking as all governors must about the economy. With marriage equality becoming law tomorrow night in Rhode Island we are sending a clear message that we are open for business and that all are welcome. I hope that leaders in capitals across the country — including Washington — will soon realize that marriage equality is an issue where doing the right thing and the smart thing are one and the same.,0
694,Story highlights NEW: President Obama says gun violence harms economic growth He awards Presidential Citizens Medals posthumously to educators killed in Newtown The NRA opposes Obama's gun plan as a step toward unconstitutional restrictions An expert on urban crime says the president's package would helpPresident Barack Obama said Friday that children from communities wracked by poverty and violence need help from the government schools family and clergy to have a chance to climb “ladders of opportunity” to reach the middle class and beyond.Speaking at a Chicago high school near where he used to live Obama cited gun violence that killed 443 people in the city last year as one reason why children need community wide support to help them believe they can improve their lives through education and hard work.“In too many neighborhoods today whether here in Chicago or the farthest reaches of rural America it can feel like for a lot of young people the future only extends to the next street corner or the outskirts of town” he said adding “that no matter how much you work or how hard you try your destiny was determined the moment you were born.”Making his third campaign-style appearance in three days Obama again emphasized proposals from Tuesday’s State of the Union address such as raising the minimum wage to $9 an hour and providing good pre-schooling for every child as necessary to help people better themselves.The president also called for Congress to vote on a package of gun proposals aimed at decreasing shootings like ones that occur daily on streets and in homes as well as mass killings in recent months at a school a movie theater and even a place of worship.According to the Centers of Disease Control there were 11078 homicides by firearm in the United States in 2010 and 7220 of the victims – 65% – were aged 15-34. In addition 6151 – or 56% – were African American a demographic that comprises about 13% of the total U.S. population.“This is not just a gun issue” he continued. “It’s also an issue of the kinds of communities that we’re building and for that we all share responsibility as citizens to fix it.”It all starts at home the president said calling “strong stable families” and “loving supportive parents” the most important ingredients for reducing violence.Noting he was raised by a single mother he called for promoting marriage and encouraging fatherhood saying he wished he had a father around and involved when he was a boy.“By the way that’s all kinds of parents” he added drawing applause when he specified “it includes gay or straight parents.”He acknowledged the challenge saying “it will not be easy but it can be done.”“No solution we offer will be perfect” he said. “But perfection has never been our goal. Our goal has been to try and make whatever difference we can.”Obama headed to his hometown after a White House ceremony Friday morning to award the Presidential Citizens Medal – the nation’s second-highest civilian honor – to 18 people. They included posthumous honors for six educators killed along with 20 first-graders in December’s Connecticut school massacre.The president hugged family members of the slain teachers and administrators from Sandy Hook Elementary School in presenting the medals saying: “We could not be more grateful to your loved ones who gave everything they had” for the children in their care.In his remarks later at Chicago’s Hyde Park Academy High School Obama mentioned Hadiya Pendleton 15 who was killed by gunfire in the city last month after returning from taking part in inaugural activities in Washington.Pendleton’s parents were in the crowd Friday just as they were at the State of the Union as guests of first lady Michelle Obama who attended Hadiya’s funeral.The president said his package of gun measures was intended to save young lives and that “they deserve a vote” repeating the phrase a few times as he did in Tuesday’s address at the Capitol.Chicago’s record murder rate: Don’t blame guns aloneFierce opposition by the National Rifle Association makes passage of any significant gun legislation uncertain. In response to Obama’s State of the Union address the NRA has sought to discredit the motives and impacts of legislation proposed by the president and Democrats.“They only care about their decades-old gun control agenda — ban every gun they can tax every gun sold and register every gun owner” NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre said in a statement on Thursday. “This president has taken the art of public deception and manipulation to a whole new level.”Obama seeks an updated version of the 1994 assault weapons ban which expired in 2004 that would prevent the manufacture and sale of some semi-automatic rifles modeled after fully automatic assault weapons.Obama’s emotional plea might lead to vote on gunsHe also proposes limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds expanding background checks to all gun transactions including sales at gun shows. In addition the president wants Congress to take steps to better screen people with mental illnesses so they cannot obtain weapons.Legislation proposed so far also would crack down on so-called straw purchases in which a legal buyer purchases weapons for distribution to non-legal buyers.The NRA and other opponents argue the Democratic proposals are veiled attempts to limit gun ownership and eventually take away weapons and therefore violate the constitutional right to bear arms.In particular opponents contend the proposed ban on semi-automatic rifles focuses on a weapon used in a tiny percentage of killings and other gun violence.Opinion: Chicago’s violence took my dad friendsHarold Pollack co-director of the University of Chicago Crime Lab confirmed on Friday that so-called assault weapons targeted by the proposed ban account for a small fraction of murders in the United States.However Pollack said the ban proposed by Obama can help reduce gun violence especially what he called the psychologically impactful mass shootings such as the Newtown attack in which a lone gunman used a Bushmaster semi-automatic rifle.The combination of such weapons with high-capacity magazines “facilitates mass homicides” Pollack told CNN noting that professional criminals generally don’t use such rifles that look like military weapons.“The people who do use these weapons are often the most dangerous or most sociopathic” Pollack said. The Newtown shooter a 20-year-old man living with his mother took her legally owned guns and killed her before going to the school to open fire on students and teachers.New player in gun control ad warsTo Pollack such a mass killing – while relatively rare – “traumatizes communities and the entire society in a way that demands attention.”Studies show that street crime such as shooting deaths cost communities more than lives Pollack said citing emergency medical services and criminal investigation as tangible costs along with intangibles such as residents moving away to escape the threat.Obama also made that point in his remarks on Friday saying “it’s very hard to develop economically if people don’t feel safe.”In the aftermath of the Newtown shootings the NRA called for putting armed guards at every school rather than seeking to limit the ability of people to obtain weapons. It also wants tougher enforcement of existing gun laws which Pollack agreed was necessary.“A lot of the underground gun market could be stopped if we treated guns with the same amount of determination and tools as the drug market” he said.For example Pollack noted how committing a crime with a gun brought additional charges and he called for similar treatment for illegally possessing a firearm.How we talk about guns in my Chicago classroomIn a Google Hangout online chat on Thursday a participant asked Obama how renewing the assault weapons ban would help reduce gun violence caused primarily by handguns.He responded that his proposed package would affect handgun violence through the expanded background checks and cracking down on straw purchases. Renewing the weapons ban focused on what Obama called “weapons of war.”“It’s not going to solve every problem” the president continued noting that some restrictions are already in place.“We can’t purchase a grenade launcher from a store although there may be some folks who want to buy those” he said. “And the reason is we think on balance the Second Amendment does not automatically assume that any weapon that’s available you can automatically purchase.”NRA: Obama’s State of the Union shows true colors on gun violenceCNN’s Ashley Killough Paul Steinhauser and Halimah Abdullah contributed to this report.,0

(RGR) rose about 4%. The stock for Sturm Ruger has risen 13% in the month since the shooting at a Newtown Conn. elementary school that left 20 children and six educators dead.Retailers that specialize in guns have also done well. The stock price for Cabela's (CAB) surged 6% on Wednesday and has gained 20% over the last month. Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) notched up slightly and has gained 6% over the month.Obama issued the call for the assault ban as part of a broad response to the Newtown shooting.""Congress should restore the ban on military style assault weapons and a 10-round limit for magazines"" the president said. Obama was referring to a 10-year ban that expired in 2004 which limited the capacity of magazines and restricted military-style features on semiautomatic rifles.Related: Obama seeks assault weapons banBut the specter of a potential ban in the wake of mass shootings around the country has prompted gun enthusiasts to stock up on the weapons that may some day be denied to them.""Consumers are flocking to stores to purchase certain types of firearms including assault rifles in fears of some type of ban going forward"" said Rommel Dionisio gun industry analyst for Wedbush Securities. ""It's people rushing to buy them before they're banned.""Dick's said last month that it has suspended sales of assault rifles.Related: Assault rifles are selling outSmith & Wesson and Sturm Ruger manufacture a wide variety of firearms including the semiautomatic rifles that are known various as assault weapons or modern sporting rifles.There are many other non-public companies that manufacture semiautomatic rifles including Bushmaster Firearms International which makes the rifle used at the Newtown shooting and also a recent shooting in Webster N.Y. where a convict burned down houses and then ambushed and killed two volunteer firefighters.Such a ban if it passes would also impact manufacturers of high-capacity magazines. They include the Beta Company which makes 100-round drums and SGM Tactical which produces 30-round and 100-round magazines.Related: A month after Newtown a massive gun trade showHigh-capacity magazines face a potential ban because they were used by Adam Lanza in the Newtown shooting and by James Holmes suspect in a mass shooting last year at a movie theater in Aurora Colo.Obama acknowledged that he faces serious opposition in trying to get an assault weapon bill passed by a Republican-controlled House.Even as Obama spoke thousands of gun industry members packed into the SHOT Show -- an annual trade show -- in Las Vegas.

696,"HARTFORD Conn. (AP) — The governors of Texas and South Dakota visited Connecticut on Monday to court gun manufacturers that have threatened to leave since the state passed tough new gun-control laws this year in response to the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School.While gun makers may be unlikely to leave behind their factories and skilled workforces executives say Texas is an appealing location — and some said the out-of-state attention marked a stark contrast with a Connecticut governor they say has shown little regard for a local industry that dates to the Revolutionary War.Texas Gov. Rick Perry shot at a firing range at Connecticut's venerable Colt Manufacturing Co. one of the plants he toured and met privately with company owners and other businesses at a downtown Hartford restaurant. At a brief news conference afterward the Republican offered a conservative policy blueprint in a state run by Democrats.""Are your tax policies really in the best interest of your job creators?"" he asked. ""Is your regulatory climate one of which (that) really allows your citizens to be able to enjoy the freedoms that they can have or they should have or that they think they should have or are they going to relocate somewhere?""Connecticut's Gov. Dannel P. Malloy a Democrat signed new gun restrictions into law in April four months after 20 children and six educators were murdered by a lone gunman at a Newtown school.Joe Bartozzi senior vice president and general counsel at O.F. Mossberg & Sons welcomed Perry's visit to the North Haven gun maker which employs 270 workers in Connecticut and 400 in Texas. He contrasted Perry's interest in the business and the jobs it provides with what he called ""less than flattering remarks"" in recent months by U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy and Malloy about the gun industry.Asked about the possibility of expanding in Texas Bartozzi said ""That would make more sense. That would be more logical for us.""Story continuesThe political climate in Connecticut is one of the factors he said. He also said taxes and costs are higher in Connecticut.Colt President and CEO Dennis Veilleux issued a statement saying Perry assured the company it would ""always be welcome in Texas.""Mark T. Malkowski president of Stag Arms in New Britain said he's been in touch with Perry's office and met with the governor in Houston last month. He said he and Perry spoke about taxes what Texas is doing ""to keep it a very friendly place for businesses"" and the cultural differences between Connecticut and Texas which is perceived as less hostile to guns.""There was nothing as much as a phone from our governor asking us to stay"" he said.Kelsey Pritchard a spokeswoman for South Dakota Gov. Dennis Daugaard said the governor and state economic development officials are visiting Connecticut on Monday and Tuesday to meet with gun manufacturers.Malkowski said the biggest obstacle to quitting Connecticut is that the company's 200 employees would have to uproot themselves and their families.""That's the hardest part. The employees make up the business"" he said.Malloy who welcomed Perry to Connecticut in an unannounced visit to the Texas governor's meeting in Hartford said the gun issue is particularly sharp in Connecticut because of the killings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School.""I don't think he understands that kind of loss and how it's affected people in our state"" Malloy said.Legislation enacted in April adds more than 100 firearms to the state's assault weapons ban and bans the sale of magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition.Perry said taxes and regulations are factors in decisions not only by gun manufacturers but by pharmaceutical companies financial firms and other businesses about where to locate.Malloy sought to blunt Perry's thrust on jobs and industry. Connecticut's governor has made economic development a signature issue since taking office in January 2011 establishing a program consolidating tax credits to draw large employers and pushing for legislation promoting small business and bioscience jobs.""Listen we compete for every job and we're doing a pretty good job at it"" he said.Perry has poached in other states. He sought to talk up Texas for jobs in California's high tech biotechnology financial insurance and film industries and urged Illinois employers to leave the state ""while there's still time.""The Texas governor who is set to visit New York during his trip to the Northeast also has run ads mocking New York's ""new New York ads"" saying the Empire State is a high-tax state that hasn't much changed.In Connecticut he tried to take the edge off his tough message.""Sometimes it's a rough business. I get that"" Perry said. ""But so is competition on an athletic field. I hope we can shake hands realize that we're just competitors. We're all Americans first.

700,"The practical reality of the executive order options before President Obama -- he is reportedly considering as many as 19 -- is that the vast majority of actions he can take are relatively minor in nature. As the Post's Wonkblog noted Tuesday: ""It’s unlikely that Obama can significantly alter gun laws through executive order.""Story continues below advertisementOf course the reality of what Obama can do via executive order and the perception of his using executive privilege to alter (or re-enforce) laws are two very different things. And it's the perception that Obama has to worry about.AdvertisementIf he does make good on all 19 executive orders (or really anything in double digits) Republicans will immediately cry foul insisting that Obama is trying to run our democracy like a dictatorship.Democrats may roll their eyes at this tactic but remember that there is a major strain of thinking in the country -- among Republicans and even some independents -- that the ultimate goal for President Obama is to take away everyone's guns. (To be clear the President has never hinted at such a move and in fact has made clear he opposes any sort of action like that.)Story continues below advertisementThe President acting alone would stoke those fears and gin up Republicans to keep any sort of larger legislation -- like say an assault weapons ban -- from moving through Congress. It would likely be seen as a poison-the-well moment from which the debate might never recover to a place where bipartisan compromise was possible.AdvertisementPresident Obama and his senior strategists are certainly aware of the danger of appearing to make (or change) law by fiat. If Obama goes big on executive orders later today it's likely because he has made the calculation that no significant number of Republicans are going to be with him on any sort of gun control measure and therefore the only way to get some of these things done is through his powers as the country's chief executive.Perhaps. But he also could run the risk of jeopardizing more broad-reaching pieces of his gun agenda if Democratic Senators up for re-election in pro-gun states like Louisiana Arkansas and South Dakota balk at getting behind his legislative solutions in the wake of an uproar over the executive orders.Story continues below advertisementObama is at heart a political pragmatist -- a bent that would suggest that he goes smaller on executive orders in hopes of getting something bigger and more meaningful legislatively.

Rick Perry and Mississippi House Speaker Philip Gunn both Republicans have made overtures to Colorado-based Magpul Industries and other manufacturers suggesting that they relocate.Magpul a manufacturer of ammunition magazines for firearms has threatened to leave Colorado if the state enacts a ban on high-capacity magazines.Perry who reportedly sent letters to 26 firearms and ammunition manufacturers earlier this month told Magpul that there is no other state ""that fits the definition of business-friendly like Texas"" according to the Denver Post.Perry's letter to Connecticut-based gun maker Mossberg & Sons reads in part ""As you consider your options for responding to unwarranted government intrusion into your business you may choose to consider relocating your manufacturing operations to a state that is more business-friendly"" according to CTMirror.org.Gunn sent letters Thursday to 14 gun manufacturers in Colorado Connecticut Maryland Massachusetts New Hampshire New York and North Carolina.""I am personally inviting you and your company to come to the great state of Mississippi"" Gunn wrote in a letter to Colt's Manufacturing Co. in Connecticut. ""In our state you will not be criticized for providing good to the law abiding citizens who enjoy hunting shooting or who just want the peace of mind that comes with the constitutional right to protect their families.""Leaders from other states have sent letters to some or all of the companies asking them to come to their homes.

703,"Former Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer has pledged his support for single-payer health care in the past but his recent efforts to bring zero-cost sharing primary and preventive care to Montana government employees and retirees may be doing something that most progressives would only dream could happen in America: bringing NHS-style socialized medicine to Montana.This is a big deal and -- while currently limited to state employees and retirees -- could be laying the groundwork for America's most socially-just health care system. NPR has the details:A year ago Montana opened the nation's first clinic for free primary healthcare services to its state government employees. The Helena Mont. clinic was pitched as a way to improve overall employee health but the idea has faced its fair share of political opposition. A year later the state says the clinic is already saving money. Pamela Weitz a 61-year-old state library technician was skeptical about the place at first. ""I thought it was just the goofiest idea but you know it's really good"" she says. In the last year she's been there for checkups blood tests and flu shots. She doesn't have to go; she still has her normal health insurance provided by the state. But at the clinic she has no co-pays no deductibles. It's free. That's the case for the Helena area's 11000 state workers and their dependents. With an appointment patients wait just a couple minutes to see a doctor. Visitation is more than 75 percent higher than initial estimates.The state contracts with a private company to run the facility and pays for everything — wages of the staff total costs of all the visits. Those are all new expenses and they all come from the budget for state employee healthcare. Even so division manager Russ Hill says it's actually costing the state $1500000 less for healthcare than before the clinic opened. ""Because there's no markup our cost per visit is lower than in a private fee-for-service environment"" Hill says. Physicians are paid by the hour not by the number of procedures they prescribe like many in the private sector. The state is able to buy supplies at lower prices. Bottom line: a patient's visit to the employee health clinic costs the state about half what it would cost if that patient went to a private doctor. And because it's free to patients hundreds of people have come in who had not seen a doctor for at least two years.Hill says the facility is catching a lot including 600 people who have diabetes 1300 people with high cholesterol 1600 people with high blood pressure and 2600 patients diagnosed as obese. Treating these conditions early could avoid heart attacks amputations or other expensive hospital visits down the line saving the state more money. Clinic operations director and physician's assistant Jimmie Barnwell says this model feels more rewarding to him. ""Having those barriers of time and money taken out of the way are a big part [of what gets] people to come into the clinic. But then when they come into the clinic they get a lot of face time with the nurses and the doctors"" Barnwell says.Yup nobody is forced to visit this publicly-financed clinic run by a private operator. If they wish they can take their big-profit private health insurance and head to any doctor they want but folks are recognizing that this err... public option provides better care. And when patients do make this choice both the state and patients save money.Take a second and let the words above sink in real deep. There you have exactly why the UK Canada Australia Italy Costa Rica Cuba and other first-world -- and third-world -- countries are able to secure better health care outcomes than the United States with dramatically lower health care spending. Imagine what -- let's call it the Montana model -- could do for our national debt . And you know even more importantly the health of our people and the wellbeing of our medical professionals.Again common sense that's not too common in these United States -- with the exception of Montana -- at the moment. High-deductible garbage plans -- promoted by big wigs at Aetna and Cigna who want patients to have more 'skin in the game' -- lead patients to delay putting off that chest pain until it becomes a heart attack...and open-heart surgery. When doctors aren't dealing with private health insurer bureaucracy and any sort of medical billing the entire resources of the practice go towards taking care of human beings. When doctors are salaried instead of operating with a fee-for-service model they emphasize quality over quantity. This is how medicine works in the UK Canada and many other countries where protecting the wealth of hospital and insurance company CEOs is not the primary goal of the health care system.Even Republicans -- who you know are naturally predisposed to hate the idea of patients seeing doctors without cost-sharing -- have a tough time faulting the new clinics.""For goodness sakes of course the employees and the retirees like it it's free"" says Republican State Sen. Dave Lewis. ... Now Lewis is a retired state employee himself. He says personally he does like going there too. ""They're wonderful people they do a great job but as a legislator I wonder how in the heck we can pay for it very long"" Lewis says.Well Mr. Republican they're saving the state millions -- you just won't admit it but at least you admit you love the socialized medicine.What's most exciting about these clinics? More are on the way.Montana recently opened a second state employee health clinic in Billings the state's largest city. Others are in the works.And best of all? Schweitzer went right around the backs of Republicans to set up these life- and money-saving clinics. That's bold progressive leadership. Let's do our best to spread the news far and wide about how the ""Montana model"" is proving what much of the rest of the world already knows: the ideal primary health care system should be free at point of use.",0
704,In a poll released Tuesday one day after President Obama slammed Republicans for what he dishonestly described as a “government shutdown” Rasmussen has found that when it comes to cutting health care costs a majority of 51% favor “having a partial government shutdown until Democrats and Republicans agree on what spending for the health care law to cut.”An even higher number of 53% favor a partial government shutdown until “Democrats and Republicans can agree on what [general] spending to cut.” Only 37% oppose.For obvious reasons the media refuse to make clear that it is not the GOP proposing any kind of government shutdown partial or otherwise. The GOP’s plan is to kill the ObamaCare debacle with a bill that funds everything but the president’s job-killing health care plan. It is up to the president and Democrat-led Senate then to decide if this wildly unpopular drag on our economy is worth shutting down the government.Both the media and the president are eager for this showdown; both relish the idea of replaying the 1990s when the media and the Clinton White House worked together to bludgeon then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich over a similar gambit.This poll though shows that this tactic might not work as well this time. Just for starters people are much more concerned about the deficit today than they were in the mid-nineties; and there was no boondoggle like ObamaCare hanging out there as a prize in a shutdown showdown.Make no mistake the media will ignore this poll. The results do not fit the media’s pro-ObamaCare Narrative and only interferes with the reality they are attempting to manufacture that says a shutdown can only mean disaster for the GOP.But to those interested in reality this poll should be food for thought.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC,1
705,Ask most people on Capitol Hill and they’ll say: 50-50. Those are the odds they give for a government shutdown.An alternative to the shutdown would be a proposed delay of the individual mandate the most painful part of Obamacare which may seem like a Republican victory but on closer inspection would be a win for President Obama and Democrats.Historians — or commentators in the meantime — might view either of these possible outcomes as yet another “Putinesca” victory for the president: Saved by the enemy.Just as Russian President Vladimir Putin emerged at the brink of the U.S. bombing of Syria to orchestrate an alternative solution Republicans may have provided a rip cord for Obama.Postponement of the individual mandate is part of the GOP bargaining package on raising the debt ceiling. Delay it for a year say Republican leaders and they’ll raise the debt limit for a year to keep the government operating.1 of 25 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × The Right’s 25 most influential from Townhall.com View Photos The conservative Web site’s latest listing of the most prominent voices on the right with a few names you may not know.

Micah Walter/Reuters Wait 1 second to continue.At least one Democrat Joe Manchin has conceded that this would be a pretty good idea since the health-care overhaul obviously isn’t ready. The many flaws have been fully vetted for months though new ones continue to reveal themselves as we approach the insurance-exchange shopping spree scheduled to begin in a few days.Latest to the fraying Affordable (now “Adorable”) Care Act is a technological glitch in online applications for small businesses. It isn’t ready yet and will be delayed.What is ready and adorable is a sampler of new ads aimed at children who are still fretful about the new plan. Oh wait no. The ads featuring baby ducks and kittens — purring and feeling ducky about Obamacare — are aimed at adults. They’re certifiably cute but one can’t escape the thought that the federal government has skipped all pretense at treating Americans as adults. Naptime anyone?To be fair Sen. Ted Cruz read Dr. Seuss’s “Green Eggs and Ham” to his children during his 21-hour un-filibuster. The muse whispers: “Ted Cruz would send Ronald Reagan back to the Democratic Party.”Here’s the problem for Republicans which will not be news to those with a view of the long game. The short game is to stall Obamacare but to what end ultimately? Until Republicans can seize the Senate in 2014 and the White House in 2016 at which point they can repeal the whole thing?Skinny chance that.More likely whether the government shuts down or should Tinker Bell suddenly materialize and persuade Obama to cave and postpone his personal dream act Republicans will be viewed by a greater majority than previously as having no talent for leadership.1 of 76 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles draws Congress View Photos A collection of cartoons about Capitol Hill.

On the other they accrue no benefit from having prevented the pain of implementing Obamacare.Republicans lose either way but they may lose biggest if they win.Alternatives to present circumstances do not abound. Republicans have drawn their line in the sand. Democrats have drawn theirs. Obama says no negotiating over the debt ceiling period.There is one alternative that is both perhaps best for the country and hardest for Obama. He could relent not to Republicans but to the greater good. He could delay full implementation past the 2014 elections which would accomplish two things: One he could iron out the wrinkles that are now apparent. Two Democrats would get to slide through another election cycle without the most visibly painful part of Obamacare — the individual mandate.What really does Obama have to lose? Only face the pain of which passes.

706,It’s possible that President Obama felt better after that confessional hour-plus press conference Thursday.He had come to publicly flog himself for the disastrous Obamacare website rollout comparing his role to that of a hapless football team captain: “If I fumble the ball you know I’m going to wait until I get the next play and then I’m going to try to run as hard as I can and do right by the team. So you know ultimately I’m the head of this team. We did fumble the ball on it.”He had also come to announce a temporary fix aimed at easing the outrage of many Americans who bought into his demonstrably untrue promise that “if you like your insurance policy you can keep it.”But it’s hard to imagine that anyone besides his Republican antagonists was comforted by the mea culpa or the newfound sense of transparency. Disappointed citizens angry insurance companies or freaked out Democratic legislators worried about their 2014 prospects probably didn’t feel a whole lot better after the president’s litany of disappointments.AdvertisementIn the course of an hour he admitted he didn’t know what was going on with the website and that partly may have been due to the “insularity” of the White House. He acknowledged he misled people by promising them they could keep their plans that it’s not easy to purchase a complicated product like health insurance online that the federal government is ill-equipped to develop technology systems.Here are seven issues Obama addressed taken from a transcript posted by the Washington Post:1. On why he allowed the Healthcare.gov website to be launched when it was failing internal tests:“OK. On the website I was not informed directly that the website would not be working the way it was supposed to. Had I been informed I wouldn’t be going out saying boy this is going to be great. You know I’m accused of a lot of things but I don’t think I’m stupid enough to go around saying this is going to be like shopping on Amazon or Travelocity a week before the website opens if I thought that it wasn’t going to work.Advertisement“So clearly we and I did not have enough awareness about the problems in the website. Even a week into it the thinking was that these were some glitches that would be fixed with patches as opposed to some broader systemic problems that took much longer to fix and we’re still working on them.“So you know that doesn’t excuse the fact that they just don’t work but I think it’s fair to say no...we would not have rolled out something knowing very well that it wasn’t going to work the way it was supposed to given all the scrutiny that we knew was going to be on the website.”2. On why he told people they could keep their insurance if they liked it:“With respect to the pledge I made that if you like your plan you can keep it I think you know and I’ve said in interviews that there is no doubt that the way I put that forward unequivocally ended up not being accurate. It was not because of my intention not to deliver on that commitment and that promise. We put a grandfather clause into the law but it was insufficient.Advertisement3. On what he’s going to do to fix that:“The other problem that has received a lot of attention concerns Americans who’ve received letters from their insurers that they may be losing the plans they bought in the old individual market often because they no longer meet the law’s requirements to cover basic benefits like prescription drugs or doctor’s visits....“I completely get how upsetting this can be for a lot of Americans particularly after assurances they heard from me that if they had a plan that they liked they could keep it. And to those Americans I hear you loud and clear. I said that I would do everything we can to fix this problem. And today I’m offering an idea that will help do it.“Already people who have plans that pre-date the Affordable Care Act can keep those plans if they haven’t changed. That was already in the law. That’s what’s called a grandfather clause that was included in the law. Today we’re going to extend that principle both to people whose plans have changed since the law took effect and to people who bought plans since the law took effect....The bottom line is insurers can extend current plans that would otherwise be canceled into 2014. And Americans whose plans have been canceled can choose to re-enroll in the same kind of plan.”Advertisement4. On why the federal government is so bad at technology systems:“There aren’t a lot of websites out there that have to help people compare their possible insurance options verify income to find out what kind of tax credits they might get communicate with those insurance companies so that they can purchase make sure that all of it’s verified right? So there’s just a bunch of pieces to it that made it challenging.“And you combine that with the fact that the federal government does a lot of things really well. One of the things it does not do well is information technology procurement. You know this is kind of a systematic problem that we have across the board....“As I said before our IT systems how we purchase technology in the federal government is cumbersome complicated and outdated....On my campaign I could simply say who are the best folks out there let’s get them around a table let’s figure out what we’re doing and we’re just going to continue to improve it and refine it and work on our goals.Advertisement“If you’re doing it at the federal government level you know you’re going through you know 40 pages of specs and this and that and the other and there’s all kinds of law involved. And it makes it more difficult. It’s part of the reason why chronically federal IT programs are over budget behind schedule.”5. On underestimating the difficulty of purchasing a complicated product like insurance online:“What we’re also discovering is that insurance is complicated to buy. And another mistake that we made I think was underestimating the difficulties of people purchasing insurance online and shopping for a lot of options with a lot of costs and lot of different benefits and plans and -- and somehow expecting that that would be very smooth and then they’ve also got to try to apply for tax credits on the website.“What we’re doing even as we’re trying to solve the technical problems is also what can we do to make the application a little bit simpler? What can we do to make it in English as opposed to bureaucrat-ese? Are there steps that we can skip while still getting the core information that people need?Advertisement“And part of what we’re realizing is that there are going to be a certain portion of people who are just going to need more help and more hand-holding in the application process....“And you know buying health insurance is never going to be like buying a song on iTunes. You know it’s just a much more complicated transaction.”6. On whether the website problems will be fixed by the end of the month as promised:”...On Dec. 1st Nov. 30th it will be a lot better but there will still be some problems. Some of those will not be because of technological problems although I’m sure that there will still be some glitches that have to be smoothed out.”Advertisement7. And finally--in my view a bit disingenuously--on why he can’t catch a break:“Part of this job is the things that go right you guys aren’t going to write about. The things that go wrong get prominent attention; that’s how it’s always been. That’s not unique to me as president and I’m up to the challenge. We’re going to get this done all right?”ALSO:More from Robin AbcarianAdvertisementPrincess Cruises says ship passenger intentionally jumped into oceanCalifornia assemblyman’s father killed in L.A. home; witnesses soughtTwitter: @robinabcarianrobin.abcarian@latimes.com,0
707,WASHINGTON — The Senate is expected to reject decisively a House bill that would delay the full effect of President Obama’s health care law as a condition for keeping the government running past Monday as Senator Harry Reid the Democratic majority leader expressed confidence that he had public opinion on his side.Angering Republicans who lead the House Mr. Reid kept the Senate shuttered on Sunday in a calculated move to stall action on the House measure until Monday afternoon just hours before the government’s spending authority runs out at midnight.Without a complete capitulation by House Republicans large sections of the government would close hundreds of thousands of workers would be furloughed without pay and millions more would be asked to work for no pay.Polls show that the public is already deeply unhappy with its leaders in Congress and the prospect of the first government shutdown in 17 years would be the latest dispiriting development. With a temporary shutdown appearing inevitable without a last-ditch compromise the battle on Sunday became as much about blaming the other side as searching for a solution.,0

709,"House Republicans are escalating their scrutiny of the decision to delay a key part of the health care overhaul questioning whether the Obama administration even has the authority to ""ignore the law"" without the approval of Congress.The administration announced early last week that it was delaying by one year a requirement that large employers offer access to health insurance. Officials described the delay as a common-sense concession to businesses who complained the rules were too onerous and maintained the Treasury Department was within its right.A Treasury official told FoxNews.com that the move was ""an exercise of the administrative authority"" under the IRS code. The official said the department has ""longstanding"" authority to ""grant transition relief when implementing new legislation"" like the health care law.A number of Republicans pointed to the sudden change as a sign of problems to come with the massive health care law. But as lawmakers return on Monday from the holiday break they're also challenging whether the tweak was an abuse of power.""This action raises a lot of questions about whether the Obama administration can simply ignore the law when it's convenient for them"" Rep. Phil Roe R-Tenn. said in a statement.He said he's asked the Congressional Research Service to ""investigate"" that issue -- ""because I don't think any president has the authority to pick and choose what parts of law to follow.""The matter will get an airing on Capitol Hill later this week. Rep. Kevin Brady R-Texas chairman of a House Ways and Means subcommittee has set a hearing for July 10 which in part will examine the issue of the administration's authority to change the law.Rep. Darrell Issa R-Calif. chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee went a step further describing the move as ""another in a string of extra legal actions taken"" by the Obama administration.The complaint about the administration's authority is just one of several Republicans have regarding the move to delay the mandate. They question whether more delays and changes are in store in the run-up to the Jan. 1 launch of many of the law's major provisions. They question why the so-called individual mandate -- the requirement on individuals to buy health insurance -- wasn't also delayed.But the Treasury Department and White House in announcing the delay last week explained that they did so after businesses complained about the reporting requirements. As the administration moves to simplify the rules they said they would in turn give businesses more time to comply.""We have heard concerns about the complexity of the requirements and the need for more time to implement them effectively. We recognize that the vast majority of businesses that will need to do this reporting already provide health insurance to their workers and we want to make sure it is easy for others to do so"" Mark J. Mazur the assistant secretary for Tax Policy at the Department of the Treasury said last week on the Treasury blog.",1
710,Californians are more supportive of President Obama’s healthcare law than the country at large but they still worry it will raise healthcare costs and hurt the economy a new poll of registered voters shows.Statewide 50% said they backed the Affordable Care Act and 42% opposed it according to the USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll. That runs counter to national polls that show more people disapprove of Obamacare than support it.AdvertisementLatinos who make up about half of California’s uninsured population were even more enthusiastic supporting the healthcare law by a 2-1 margin. Forty-nine percent of whites were opposed with 44% in favor.Predictably 77% of Democrats backed the president’s healthcare plan whereas 80% of Republicans surveyed said they were against it. Independents were more evenly split.AdvertisementCutting across partisan and racial lines Californians as a whole were skeptical that the Affordable Care Act would live up to its name.Sixty-five percent of respondents said people wouldn’t be able to afford the health insurance they’ll be required to have under the law’s individual mandate. Forty percent think the program will have a negative effect on what they pay for coverage compared with 21% who expect a positive outcome.AdvertisementAccording to the survey 46% of registered voters expect the Affordable Care Act to be a drag on the overall economy and 34% see an economic boost. Nearly 60% think the law’s new requirements will raise healthcare costs and keep businesses from hiring more workers.The poll was taken just as the national healthcare rollout was coming under intense criticism in Congress even from some Democrats. Obama has apologized for the malfunctioning healthcare.gov enrollment website and for millions of Americans receiving cancellation notices because their current coverage doesn’t meet all the requirements of the healthcare law.AdvertisementThose consumers have directed much of their anger at Obama’s repeated pledge that Americans could keep their existing insurance if they liked it.California is running its own insurance exchange as are 13 other states and its online enrollment hasn’t experienced nearly as many problems as the federal marketplace for 36 states. But the sticker shock from higher premiums and concerns about losing access to preferred doctors and hospitals have taken a toll.Advertisement“California has had a pretty good rollout on its exchange compared to the national one but people here are still feeling the negative repercussions of higher costs and lost policies” said David Kanevsky of American Viewpoint the Republican firm that helped conduct the poll for the USC Dornsife College of Letters Arts and Sciences and The Times.The poll was conducted jointly by American Viewpoint and Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research a Democratic polling firm in Washington. They surveyed 1503 registered state voters by telephone Oct. 30-Nov. 5. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points and larger for subgroups.AdvertisementFor Obama and his signature law much depends on Californians embracing the changes. California wants to enroll more than 2 million people by the end of next year in subsidized health insurance or an expansion of Medi-Cal the state’s Medicaid program for the poor.Poll respondents said they were upbeat about the law’s potential to help many of the state’s 7 million uninsured. Sixty-five percent expect there will be fewer people without coverage and 67% think patients will get more access to checkups and other preventive care.Advertisement“Fundamentally Californians are viewing the Affordable Care Act as a mixed bag” said Drew Lieberman of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner. “They harbor real concerns about the potential negative impact on costs and the economy.”Diana Sackett 61 a software engineer in Pleasanton has many of those worries even though she strongly supports the president’s healthcare plan. She has battled cancer in the past and knows the value of quality health coverage. “In an advanced country like ours everyone should be able to get the healthcare they need” Sackett said.AdvertisementBut she isn’t optimistic that the healthcare law will stem the rising costs of medical care and fears it may even get worse with an influx of newly insured patients.“I’m concerned it won’t really address the cost problems” said Sackett who pays for health insurance through her employer. “I think healthcare is still going to be pretty expensive.”AdvertisementAccording to the poll the changes are being implemented at a time when voters are generally satisfied with their own healthcare. Ninety percent of respondents said they were happy with the quality of their medical care and access to their doctors.The state’s health insurance exchange Covered California also faces deep skepticism among its core audience.AdvertisementEven uninsured Californians who stand to benefit the most from the changes were split. Forty-eight percent favored the law while 45% were against.Individuals who now purchase their own policies were more negative. Forty-nine percent were opposed to the law and 44% said they were in favor.AdvertisementKathryn Davis 29 an unemployed lab technician in San Diego already had her doubts about Obamacare. Then she received a cancellation notice from her insurer joining an estimated 1 million Californians who have received similar termination letters in recent weeks.“It makes me angry I will be forced to purchase a new policy I don’t want and fined if I don’t” she said.AdvertisementDavis said she paid $130 a month for a Blue Shield of California policy. On the state exchange she saw a mid-level Silver plan from Blue Shield that would cost her $96 a month thanks to a federal subsidy of $187 a month based on her income.Her annual deductible would decrease and the coverage would be more comprehensive including benefits such as maternity care. Even though it may be a better deal for her Davis said she feared government spending on insurance subsidies would trigger huge tax increases.AdvertisementCalifornia exchange officials say they are ramping up their marketing campaign this month to better explain the new insurance options and address some of the criticisms. People must enroll by Dec. 15 if they want coverage Jan. 1. Open enrollment in the exchange runs through March 31.In the poll 42% of respondents said they still didn’t have enough information about the healthcare law. Statewide 50% of Latinos said they didn’t know enough about the overhaul.AdvertisementFederico del Castillo a 51-year-old Bellflower resident said he couldn’t afford health insurance for himself while he searched for a new job in sales. His wife has coverage through her job and his three young daughters are enrolled in a low-cost government program for children.He said he’d heard about all the glitches with Obamacare but he hoped it would make coverage affordable for him. He hears a lot of conflicting information about the program from neighbors and friends at church.Advertisement“Everyone is so confused” Del Castillo said. “I don’t think most people are getting all the information they need.”chad.terhune@latimes.comAdvertisementTwitter: @chadterhune,1
711,"For a brief piece of background I am a family practice physician in a multi-specialty group of about 60 doctors mostly primary care.I think most people would agree that the American healthcare system has a lot of flaws. One of the biggest flaws is our fee-for-service system in general. It doesn't make any sense but I get paid the same to see someone for an ear infection as I do to see someone with high blood pressure high cholesterol and diabetes. Someone comes for an appointment and based on the level of detail I obtain in the history the level of detail needed in physical examination and the complexity of medical decision-making that determines the fee for the visit. So as you can imagine an ear infection or sore throat requires a LOT less work than managing three or more chronic problems and the medications labs monitoring tests etc. that go along with them. But again you are paid the same to see the ear infection patient as you are to see the person with uncontrolled diabetes high BP and high cholesterol.On the surface that makes no sense at all but the thinking is that it probably costs too much for the ear infection too little for the diabetes/BP/cholesterol patient but it all evens out in the long run. The rules for 'coding' a level of service for an appointment govern the fees and they are relatively simple as otherwise it would just be too complicated to have a different fee structure for every diagnosis. Anyway the idea is that it all comes out in the wash. That might be true in a simple world but of course we live in a complex world with a lot of moving parts.As you can see the fee-for-service environment does not really incentivize physicians to focus their efforts on chronic disease management. I'm not implying that physicians are not trying to do a good job or are just in it to make as much money as possible but let's face it: if you make the same amount per patient and you can see 30 patients with ear infections or 15 diabetic/hypertensive/hyperlipidemic patients which would you choose? How would you set up your schedule?Everyone agrees that prevention is the most cost-effective way to keep people healthy. Vaccines for example are arguably the single most cost-effective thing in all of medicine (get your flu vaccine if you have not already done so by the way!). Preventative care is now covered without a co-pay because of the ACA. That is awesome. However better care/control of chronic disease doesn't pay well as discussed above. But better control of diabetes of BP of cholesterol of COPD of asthma of heart failure will save lots and lots and lots of money in the long run because complications of all these diseases are expensive. It costs a LOT to be in the hospital to have a heart bypass to have dialysis etc. A rough estimate is that a well-controlled diabetic costs the system an average of $4000 per year to take care of but an uncontrolled diabetic will cost $16000 or more. So why would we pay doctors the same for an ear infection as we would to take care of serious chronic disease?Part of the answer unfortunately is that people switch insurances and by the time they develop more significant complications they are on Medicare anyway so UHC Humana Anthem don't need to worry about paying for dialysis. In the long run though it saves us all money if we do a better job of taking care of chronic illness. So it makes sense to try to incentivize doctors to improve our chronic disease management instead of incentivizing doctors to just see as many patients as possible in the day.So enough background. Here's the good stuff. The ACA provides funding and guidance for a new way to approach health care. The Comprehensive Primary Care initiative is a program that involves about 500 practices across the country in several geographic areas. Southwest Ohio/N. KY New Jersey Arkansas Colorado New York Oregon and Oklahoma have participating practices. Practices were selected based on a number of factors including past willingness to participate in such things as NCQA quality recognition and patient-centered medical home (PCMH) certification. You can read more here: http://innovation.cms.gov/...Basically CMS (center for Medicare and Medicaid services) provides funding outside of the fee-for-service environment for practices to do a better job of chronic disease management. There is/was a detailed application process and multiple milestones you have to meet but a lot of it boils down to CMS providing additional monies for practices to use as they see fit in order to help improve the care for their patients particularly (although not exclusively) those with higher risk chronic illness.The whole thing is actually really interesting. While there are quite a lot of specifics there are also a lot of areas open to interpretation. CMS is partnering with multiple private insurance carriers to provide a monthly fee (outside of any appointment or fee-for-service interaction) to physician practices in order to help those practices invest in infrastructure which will help improve patient care. The amount per patient per month is based on risk assessment. Basically the more diagnoses and the more complicated a patient is the higher the monthly fee. A well-controlled diabetic would have a lower fee than a diabetic with chronic kidney disease heart disease and neuropathy. So right off the bat you can see how this is a paradigm shift from the traditional fee-for-service environment. You may actually be paid more to take care of a more complicated person and try to keep them out of the hospital.However and this is a BIG part the money from this CPC initiative can NOT be paid to physicians as compensation. It is to be used to improve infrastructure. This is actually pretty cool because instead of just paying doctors more and saying ""hey if we pay you more you'll do a better job right?"" CMS is saying ""we will give you money to use as you see fit (within the structure of our program and its milestones) to improve patient care which should improve outcomes decrease severe complication rates improve patient satisfaction and eventually decrease overall costs through an investment up front.""If you hadn't already guessed my group has several practices involved in the CPCI program and we are excited about it. I don't know what the other 490-some practices across the country are doing but we have used the money to hire more staff including what we call Care Coordinators for each office an RN who can reach out to patients before during and after appointments to see how we can better coordinate care. We try to have labs drawn before folks come for appointments so we can have already reviewed the results before walking in the room. This allows for more efficient care. If someone's cholesterol is not to goal for example we can increase the dose of their cholesterol medication while sitting with them and explaining why an LDL goal of under 70 is the target. This works a lot better than a medical assistant calling someone and playing phone tag three days after their appointment to try to make sure they know that the new dose is 40 mg instead of 20. Anyway the Care Coordinator can help reach out to people who might need help paying for meds and see what assistance programs might help someone. She can help someone who was recently in the hospital understand their new medication regimen and help set up their follow up. If someone doesn't go for the colonoscopy or mammogram that we ordered she can call them and find out why and/or encourage them to go (and maybe mention that preventative care is covered 100% now!). She can review their chart ahead of time and put in a reminder for the doctor that the patient is due for a pneumonia vaccine or a shingles vaccine. This is all part of the team-based approach to care which is helping to improve patient outcomes. Our practice would not really been able to afford a Care Coordinator without the CPCI monies. Our group has also decided to hire a diabetes educator. Insurance is often squirrelly about paying for diabetes education despite study after study clearly showing the benefits. Now we will be able to offer diabetes eduction free of charge to all of our patients. This is pretty great all around. The doctors get more help the patients get more individualized attention and care outcomes improve which specifically means someone didn't have a stroke. Someone didn't lose their vision because of diabetes. Someone had a precancerous colon polyp removed instead of being diagnosed with metastatic cancer a couple years later. Someone's grandmother didn't lose her foot. Oh and all that stuff also saves money.That's the other piece of the CPCI which is a multi-year venture: ""shared savings."" You can calculate how much a population of patients is likely to cost over say three years based on how sick they are. If people get their blood pressure cholesterol blood sugar asthma under better control they will cost less to take care of because they will have fewer ER visits fewer hospitalizations fewer procedures. Sure they might take more medications get more frequent lab tests maybe more frequent (outpatient) doctor appointments but this leads to an overall reduction of the cost of care. So for the additional work to do a better job of taking care of patients practices in each region get a chance to share in the $$ saved by providing more efficient care. This will be calculated and distributed equally among the 75 or so practices in each region.There's of course a lot more to the story but this diary is already rather lengthy. I'm excited about the program though. It really is a win-win. It has a lot of the things that us progressives like: government-initiated innovation. Science-based (or to use the medical buzzword evidence-based) care. Regulations on how the money can be used with the greater good in mind. Short term investment for long term success (I didn't mention that the money is eventually phased out with the hope that the infrastructure improvements will lead to overall better reimbursements and a focus on ""pay-for-performance"" or better pay for better quality care). Using government dollars to help those who need it most (ie sicker patients). Shared benefits in the long run for all of us. If we are all healthier we cost less to the healthcare system. We are more productive workers. We have fewer people on disability. We end up putting more $$ back into the economy and indirectly increase government revenue (if you can work more and make more money because you are healthier you end up paying more taxes and of course can purchase more goods and services).Anyway it's a relatively small part of the ACA and unless you go to a practice involved in the CPCI you likely would never hear about it. But in the long run the idea is that the extra $$ will help to transform how we provide care therefore leading to a sea change in primary care across the country. If you get better outcomes improve patient satisfaction AND save money while practicing a certain way every practice is going to want to adopt these methods. Over the next few years the 500 practices will be sharing (HIPAA-compliant) data successes and failures to try to come up with ""best practices"" we can all use to keep people healthier longer. Because everyone benefits from that and that is really what the Affordable Care Act is about.",0
712,"It’s all part of a wider Washington offensive. As another recent Politico news item reported “Fix the Debt is ramping back up its lobbying efforts as government funding fights become the topic du jour on Capitol Hill.” Politico listed a group of Republican and Democratic politicians who “met Monday with Maya MacGuineas head of the campaign and members of the group’s CEO council and small business members.” [...] But can they really come to a deal? Tea Party Republicans are demanding Obamacare’s repeal in return for a budget deal. The President says he’ll refuse to negotiate. Things look hopelessly gridlocked. Look again. Boehner will want to give his party’s Tea Party wing something in return for dropping their futile Obamacare attacks and entitlements would be the perfect prize. As for the president in a terse conversation with Boehner on Friday he merely said “he wouldn’t negotiate with him on the debt limit” according to Boehner’s office. The president and White House officials have consistently echoed the line taken last Sunday by presidential economic advisor Gene Sperling on a reporters’ call. “The President is not going to negotiate over the debt limit” said Sperling. (emphasis ours) [...] And Republican Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma said this: “If we found $700 billion in savings from entitlements—Medicare Medicaid and Social Security—it would relieve pressure on the Pentagon and on non-mandatory spending. All the cuts they need are there to avoid a possible shutdown.”While the nation is being diverted by the antics of Sen. Ted ""Calgary"" Cruz  the deficit fetishists smell blood in the water. Budget fight? That means they have a chance to get those entitlement cuts that they've devoted their lives to because while President Obama said he wouldn't negotiate on the debt limit he said no such thing about resolving the budget crisis. The cuts to Social Security and Medicare he offered up in his budget are still on the table and the catfood crowd sees their opportunity Richard Eskow explains.So tempting for would-be compromisers among the Democrats and so unnecessary. Republicans are well aware who is going to get the blame if the government shuts down andare the ones over a barrel. Furthermore a willingness to allow the Republicans to see this out would go some distance to convince the GOP that yeah there's no negotiating the debt ceiling.Something else Democrats should think about: cuts to Social Security and Medicare are even more unpopular than a government shutdown would be. There's no need to go there. At all.Join Daily Kos and CREDO in telling the Senate now is not the time to think about cuts to Social Security. Now is the time to support the Harkin and Begich plans to strengthen Social Security.",1
713,It's beginning to look as if the Republican effort to hold the rest of the government hostage for the sacking of the Affordable Care Act just might backfire big time. For starters the effort has elicited something long missing on the part of this president -- some spine.Ever since he stepped into the Rose Garden on October 1 to warn the Republicans that he simply wasn't prepared to negotiate while the government was shut down and default on the debt was threatened we've seen a much tougher Obama. The split in the Republicans meanwhile continues to widen with an ever-increasing backlash among party professionals against the nihilism of Ted Cruz and company. Poor John Boehner tacks back and forth between frantically trying to hold his coalition together and signaling that he'd be willing to suspend the Hastert Rule and allow pragmatic Republicans vote with Democrats to keep the government open.Public opinion seems to be moving against the Republicans. The question is no longer whether they will continue their suicidal gambit but when they will cave and on what terms.Weirdly by threatening to shut the government unless Obama killed the Affordable Care act they got the opposite of what they sought. The rest of the government is closed and Obamacare is open for business.And while Republicans and movement conservatives have spent the better part of a year demonizing Obama's health reform the more people become familiar with it the more people will appreciate it -- leaving the Republican alarmism with no clothes. In that regard the president and his strategists would do well to change one core piece of their rhetoric. In his Rose Garden remarks the president said this:Now of course if you're one of the 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance you don't need to do a thing. You're already benefiting from new benefits and protections that have been in place for some time under this law. But for the 15 percent of Americans who don't have health insurance this opportunity is life-changing.In fact that's profoundly wrong and weakens the president's case. The statistically accurate contention that 85 percent of people will have no change in their insurance is a throwback to the early days of the health reform debate when focus groups suggested that people who had employer-provided insurance and liked it needed to be reassured.But a lot has changed since then. Employer coverage is eroding. People who lose jobs or change jobs typically lose their insurance. COBRA protection paid entirely by the former worker is only a temporary and largely unaffordable stopgap.The fact is that the Affordable Care Act helps a lot more the 15 percent of the population. Young adults with no employer-provided insurance (and their parents) already know how valuable Obamacare is for allowing people under age 26 to stay on their parents' insurance. People without jobs and at risk of losing jobs are also coming to value the Affordable Care Act.There is an analogy here with the revolution in broad acceptance of sexual diversity. As more and more gays and lesbians came out straight people were initially shocked then surprisingly accepting as they realized that they had a friend co-worker neighbor or family member who turned out to be gay.As more and more people sign up for affordable insurance thanks to Obama Care many Americans who have insurance (and many who are worried about losing it) will hear heart-rending firsthand stories about friends colleagues and relatives with medical worries who finally get insurance. That coalition is a lot more than 15 percent.Many of these people incidentally are in red states where the percentage of the uninsured tends to be far higher than the national average. In several such states Republican governors have broken ranks and signed their states up for the provision of the Affordable Care Act that has the Federal government finance nearly all the costs of expanded Medicaid.No wonder the Republicans are so desperate to kill Obamacare in utero. The more it takes effect the more their hysteria will be proven to be a phony. By 2014 when the Republican House majority will present itself for re-election the Affordable Care Act could be quite popular. What then?President Obama increasingly finds himself in the chips. Let's see if this time he can resist the impulse to fold a winning hand.Robert Kuttner's new book is Debtors' Prison: The Politics of Austerity Versus Possibility.

714,Our Johnny-on-the-spot media elite are all over the devilish details of ObamaCare this week. The three-year anniversary of the signing of the bloated government grab is tomorrow and what better time to point out its massive failures and punitive complications than after it is too late to do anything about it?In the media’s defense some of the failures being reported on now weren’t apparent in 2009 and 2010 but that’s not my complaint. My complaint — and what should be America’s complaint — is where was this kind of scrutiny and reporting when this terrible bill was being gamed through the all-Democrat federal government?As we all know skeptical forward-looking media analysis of ObamaCare was pretty much non-existent back then. We also know that those who did read the bill and report on its real and potential horrors (through New Media and in Townhall meetings) were demonized by the media.Rather than report on the devilish details or laugh Democrats out of office for submitting fraudulent ObamaCare budgets to the CBO so the monstrosity could be called “deficit neutral” the media instead played State Pipe Organ and focused on all the “goodies.”In the meantime out here in the real world and contrary to all those cotton candy promises the media assured us would come true insurers facing all kinds of restrictions and a glut of sick people have boosted our health care premiums and companies everywhere are cutting back employee work hours to avoid being forced to provide insurance. Moreover contrary to Obama’s biggest promise people are losing their insurance because companies would prefer to pay the fine than for the Cadillac plans ObamaCare demands.And how can one even begin to count the number of individual ObamaCare horror stories that dribble out almost daily not from the ObamaMedia naturally — but from conservative media sites like Drudge? We’re about to face a terrifying shortage of physicians and heaven only knows what this means.But if you believe in the philosophy of better-late-than-never Politico actually summoned a little moral courage Friday morning. One of its morning leads takes a fairly in-depth look at how the bill remains unpopular and the massive uphill battle the government faces (money and tech) to get the ObamaCare pieces in place by October when people are supposed to start signing up. (ObamaCare’s insurance exchanges and most punishing mandates hit early next year.)Here’s Wednesday’s Wonk Blog at the Washington Post:Last week I posted a copy of the draft application for Obamacare benefits which clocks in at a hefty 21 pages.Consumer advocates and Wonkblog commenters had similar questions: Why on earth would the federal government create such a complex form to obtain a public benefit?You don’t have to spend much time with the chart to get that it’s really not simple at all.And Wednesday’s New York Times:‘Our revenues are about $8 million but the food business is a low-margin industry so cutting $108000 out of our profits which are just over $200000 is a big deal’ said Ms. Shein who is the chief executive. They are evaluating different ways to comply with the new law and finance the expense.You get my point. But if you don’t Sean Hannity has a terrific round-up here.Over at Investors Business Daily they’ve come up with “10 Disturbing Facts Americans Have Learned” about ObamaCare over the last three years.A better title might have been “10 Disturbing Facts About ObamaCare the Media Are Still Covering Up.”Regardless “disturbing” is a kind word when you’re talking about skyrocketing premium costs losing your employer-based insurance having your hours cut back and nearly a trillion in new tax hikes that will hit the middle class.The damage Obama Democrats the media and the Supreme Court have done to this country is impossible to wrap your mind around. How did so many become so corrupted that they gleefully aided and abetted the likely destruction of our most vital and successful institution: the imperfect but still amazing American health care system?And God help us; it is just getting started.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC,1

716,Last month department heads in Brevard County Fla. were told to plan similar cuts in advance of the 2015 deadline. Brevard County Insurance Director Jerry Visco estimated the new mandate would cost the county $10000 per part-time employee — or $1.38 million a year if all 138 part-time employees who work more than 30 hours a week are covered he told Florida Today. The Brevard County libraries have already cut hours for 37 employees.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“It’s not something we prefer to do but the cost of health insurance is significant and would really impact municipal budgets” said Anthony Mercantante Middletown’s township administrator. “It’s not something we can take on particularly when we don’t know some of the other ramifications of the Affordable Care Act. There are far more questions than answers right now.”Middletown spends about $9 million a year out of its $65 million budget on employee health policies Mercantante said.Elsewhere Lynchburg Va. administrators have cut hours for 35 to 40 part-time employees. Chesterfield County just south of Richmond is likely to cut the hours of “several hundred” employees the county director of human resources told the Richmond Times-Dispatch earlier this year. Chippewa County Wisc. will drop 15 part-time positions to avoid up to $163000 in annual health care costs the county administrator told Wisconsin Public Radio in April.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIn a statement provided to GovBeat White House Council of Economic Advisers chairman Jason Furman said there is no evidence that the Affordable Care Act is prompting employers to add part-time rather than full-time positions.“Since the ACA became law nearly 90% of the gain in employment has been in full-time positions. Furthermore the law is helping make health insurance coverage more affordable which supports job growth” Furman said. “Just yesterday we learned that the growth in employers’ health care premiums has slowed significantly recently to less than a third of the growth rate in the late ’90s and early 2000s.”Other supporters of the law suggested the cuts could actually cost counties and cities more money than if they simply paid for part-time workers’ health-care costs.Story continues below advertisement“There are some costs of doing business where it really does cost you more money to have multiple people on the job” said Gary Burtless a senior fellow of economic studies at the Brookings Institution. “Why would you create more jobs than you need to at 20 hours a week when if you’re really responding to the Affordable Care Act you would assign people to work 29 hours a week?”Advertisement“I don’t think this is going to be a big direct-cost burden for counties and municipalities” Burtless added.,1
717,WASHINGTON — House Republicans united Wednesday around a plan to use the threat of a government shutdown as leverage to repeal President Obama’s healthcare law confident the American people are on their side.House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) yielded to his right flank by agreeing to attach the healthcare law repeal to a must-pass bill to keep the government funded past Sept. 30. A vote is expected Friday on a bill that would allow the government to stay open for the next few months.AdvertisementThe measure is all but certain to pass the Republican-led House but faces rejection in the Senate where the Democratic majority has shown little interest in undoing Obama’s signature domestic achievement.Without a resolution by Oct. 1 the start of the new federal fiscal year the government will run out of money to keep federal workers on the job and provide basic services.AdvertisementBoehner and his leadership team had tried to avoid a prolonged battle over government funding but the speaker saw no other option after the most conservative House members revolted last week.“Every member in this room is for defunding Obamacare” Boehner told his colleagues in a private meeting in the Capitol basement according to a source in the room. “We’re going to send it over to the Senate so our conservative allies over there can continue the fight.”AdvertisementTop Republicans worry the party will be blamed if government services are interrupted much the way the party suffered during the last shutdowns in the mid-1990s. They were hoping to hold off the fight over repealing the healthcare law until next month when Obama may be forced to bargain in exchange for the administration’s request to raise the debt limit to borrow money to avoid defaulting on the nation’s bills.But many rank-and-file Republicans believe stopping the healthcare law is their constituents’ top priority.Advertisement“We’re doing what the American people are asking us to do” said third-term Rep. Marlin Stutzman (R-Ind.). “I think now is the time. You take the best opportunity that you have.”Rep. Tom Graves (R-Ga.) among those leading the fight said “I think over the next 12 days there’s going to be a strong argument from the American people saying this is the path forward.”AdvertisementPolls show more Americans oppose the law the Affordable Care Act than support it even as the online health insurance marketplaces are set to open Oct. 1. Obama on Wednesday asked the Business Roundtable an organization of top business leaders to use its influence to encourage lawmakers to “not promise apocalypse every three months.”“I think this is the time for us to say once and for all we can’t afford these kinds of plays” Obama said. “I know the American people are tired of it. I’m tired of it and I suspect you’re tired of it too.”AdvertisementA similar message was sent to Capitol Hill from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce which warned that it was “not in the best interest of the U.S. business community or the American people to risk even a brief government shutdown.”The fight to keep the government running is the first in series of choke points this fall that Republicans intend to use to pressure Obama since they have failed repeatedly to stop the healthcare law.AdvertisementBy mid-October Congress will be asked to raise the debt limit and Republican leaders are gearing up to demand a one-year delay of the healthcare law as part of any deal with the White House. The funding bill if approved would keep the government open through Dec. 15.How Congress will handle the Sept. 30 deadline for a government funding resolution remains an open question.AdvertisementSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) will probably ask Democrats to strip the healthcare law repeal from the resolution but Republicans in the Senate will be under enormous pressure to prevent that.Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) a potential presidential contender who has been a vocal opponent of the healthcare law and other conservative senators are being urged by their House colleagues to mount a round-the-clock filibuster if needed to thwart Democrats.AdvertisementThe senator however did not appear to promise heroics as he acknowledged Reid probably had enough votes. But Cruz’s spokesman said “all options remain on the table.”Intensifying the threat of a shutdown Boehner does not appear to have a backup plan if the Senate sends the funding bill back to the House without the healthcare law repeal.AdvertisementMany House Republicans appear unprepared for that scenario which could unfold late next week. Others such as Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.) insisted they would not vote for a bill that did not kill the healthcare law.“This is the line in the sand” he said.AdvertisementBoehner may need to rely on Democrats to help pass the bill which he has been increasingly reluctant to do because it could threaten his already shaky hold over his Republican majority.lisa.mascaro@latimes.comAdvertisementChristi Parsons in the Washington bureau contributed to this report.,0
718,Debacle disaster disgrace: just three of many descriptors used to characterize the president’s attempted implementation of ObamaCare.Each week offers new cause for alarm: whether a dysfunctional website rife with opportunity for security breaches health care cancellation notices or sharp increases in health care premiums ObamaCare has quickly devolved into a political third rail for the Democratic party.Out of the ashes of ObamaCare however rises a golden opportunity for the Republican party – so long as the GOP’s leadership has the presence of mind to grasp the full implications of this historic moment.[pullquote]As President Obama’s approval ratings sink Republicans have a narrow window of opportunity to begin the process of rebranding themselves as true defenders of the middle class.And boy do they need it. Though aligned with most Americans in opposition to ObamaCare Republicans are sinking deeper and deeper into a hole of their own digging.No matter how hard they try to align themselves with a majority of Americans Republicans simply aren’t connecting with the middle class who view them as a party of “old rich white men” or “the party of ‘no.’” These perceptions are reflected in recent poll numbers which show GOP approval ratings hovering below 30%.As someone who manages brands for a living I can assert with confidence that all successful brands stand for something. It is not enough to merely be against something no matter how unpopular that “something” is. All durable brands are associated with at least one positive attribute in the minds of consumers - or in this case voters.That is certainly not the case for the GOP right now.Americans want leadership on the issue of health care and they will reject politicians who delay the hard work of problem-solving.As such the GOP’s anti-ObamaCare rhetoric has gone stale. Republicans must abandon their “party of ‘no’” moniker by sharing their vision of what “no” should be replaced with. In other words Republicans must explain to voters what they stand for as well as what they’re against.A party that controls only one chamber of the legislative branch cannot make public policy. But the House GOP can facilitate the collapse of ObamaCare by aligning Republicans with the interests of hardworking Americans and forcing Democrats to side with the special interest groups that are poised to profit from them.In order for this to work actions taken by the House GOP should be accompanied by simple straightforward messaging so that voters can connect with the Republican narrative on a visceral level.Visceral connections require visceral emotions -- and only two things stoke the ire of Americans as deeply as Congress: trial lawyers and insurance companies. If Republicans leverage this antipathy to their advantage Democrats will find themselves in the unenviable position of being defenders of both.The House should pass two bills recognizing that Frosty the Snowman has better prospects on a Hawaiian vacation than these bills do of ever becoming law. Nonetheless they will set the stage for Republicans to become day-saving heroes for most voters on the issue of health care.First the House should pass a tort reform bill aimed at reducing medical malpractice premiums for the sole purpose of reducing health care costs. GOP messaging points should target trial lawyers framing them as special interest groups explaining how they’ve influenced the architects of ObamaCare and how they plan to profit from it.Concurrently Republicans should explain how tort reform would decrease doctors’ costs of doing business and how those savings would be passed on to hardworking Americans.A few weeks later the House should pass another bill permitting interstate competition for health insurance companies.Doing so would force Democrats to defend ObamaCare’s protection of these quasi monopolies.GOP messaging should highlight Democrats’ crony capitalism at the expense of free-market competition and individual choice.ObamaCare is a “teachable moment” in this regard. Americans will always choose freedom and choice over being told what to do so long as Republicans connect the dots for them.Will these two bills and messaging points represent all that is needed to repair the GOP’s brand? Absolutely not. There is far more work to be done on that front.But these initial efforts represent a meaningful first step in the right direction: one that recasts Republicans as defenders of the middle class rather than merely an unpalatable alternative to the left.,1
719,Last night the House took several budget-related votes putting us on the path toward a government shutdown.The first vote was to amend the Senate continuing resolution or CR with the repeal of the medical device tax.That passed by a vote of 248 to 174.17 Democrats defected from the party line:Ron Barber (AZ-02)John Barrow (GA-12)Cheri Bustos (IL-17)John Delaney (MD-06)Tammy Duckworth (IL-08)Bill Enyart (IL-12)Dan Maffei (NY-24)Sean Maloney (NY-18)Jim Matheson (UT-04)Mike McIntyre (NC-07)Jerry McNerney (CA-09)Patrick Murphy (FL-18)Bill Owens (NY-21)Scott Peters (CA-52)Nick Rahall (WV-03)Brad Schneider (IL-10)Kyrsten Sinema (AZ-09)In the next vote the House voted to amend the Senate's CR with a one-year delay in implementation of provisions of the Affordable Care Act like the health care marketplaces and the individual mandate.That passed by a vote of 231 to 192.Two Republicans defected from party line: Chris Gibson (NY-19) and Richard Hanna (NY-22).Two Democrats defected from party line: Jim Matheson (UT-04) and Mike McIntyre (NC-07).Keep in mind that both Matheson and McIntyre are on the DCCC's Front Line so the $$$s they collect by fundraising off this vote will go to the two Democrats who voted with GOP to shut down the government.Many members of the DCCC Front Line all of whom face tight races voted against both of these measures. John Tierney (MA-06) and Carol Shea-Porter (NH-01) come to mind as examples of some of the better names on the Front Line. So those who voted for them have no excuses.And honestly the Democratic Party would be better off by cutting funds from party deadwood and making actual efforts to win blue seats held by Republicans like those of Pete King and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. However Steve Israel's friendship with King and DWS's friendship with Ileana are perpetual roadblocks.In addition the House also unanimously voted to continue appropriations for military pay in the event of a government shutdown.,0

722,"House Republican leaders heading into a rare weekend session struggled with a tough choice after Senate Democrats succeeded in passing a ""clean"" budget bill which contrary to GOP wishes restores funding for ObamaCare.The Senate capping a dramatic week on Capitol Hill approved the bill on Friday after Democrats stripped a Republican-backed provision to defund the health law. The final vote was 54-44.The House is expected to take up the legislation starting on Saturday and the bill is seen by some lawmakers as a sort of legislative hot potato. If the two chambers cannot agree on a final bill by midnight on Monday then the government will shut down. Neither side wants to be left holding the bill if that happens.House Speaker John Boehner could theoretically just call up the Senate-passed bill and rely on mostly Democrats to pass it. But House Republicans are under heavy pressure now from fellow conservatives to stand by their demand that ObamaCare be defunded or least delayed.A group of 62 conservative Republican lawmakers emerged late Friday with a proposed amendment to the spending bill that would delay the entire health care law for a year. Rep. Tom Graves R-Ga. said he plans to introduce the amendment when the House considers the funding bill.""This approach was developed over several meetings with House Republicans with a goal of keeping our conference unified as we continue working to keep the government open and protect our constituents from the harmful effects of ObamaCare” Graves said in a statement.Sen. Ted Cruz R-Texas who staged an unsuccessful effort to stall the bill in the Senate predicted the House would restore anti-ObamaCare provisions -- and urged Senate Republicans to unite with them. ""Today far too many Republicans joined Harry Reid in giving the Democrats the ability to fund ObamaCare"" he said.Boehner signaled he will not accept the Senate-passed bill in its current form. If the bill is altered in any way it will have to return to the Senate for yet another vote.""The House will take action that reflects the fundamental fact that Americans don't want a government shutdown and they don't want the train wreck that is ObamaCare"" spokesman Brendan Buck said in a statement.But President Obama during remarks at the White House warned Republicans not to go down that road.""(Undoing ObamaCare is) not gonna happen"" Obama said. ""House Republicans will have to decide whether to join the Senate and keep the government open or shut it down because they can't get their way. ... This grandstanding has real effects on real people.""Obama also warned Republicans to back down on threats to tie an increase in the debt ceiling to other demands claiming a U.S. default would cause an ""economic shutdown.""Should Republicans stand by their anti-ObamaCare demands Democrats have launched an aggressive campaign to pre-emptively blame them for a government shutdown. During a post-vote press conference Senate Democrats displayed a countdown clock to the ""Republican government shutdown.""""I don't know of anyone who wants to shut down the government. The only thing we want to shut down is ObamaCare"" Sen. Marco Rubio R-Fla. said.Amid the fighting federal agencies are warning about the impact of the looming shutdown. The Pentagon warned Friday that as many as 400000 civilian workers could be furloughed. Military personnel are not subject to furlough and would continue to work for the time being without pay.Democrats used the doomsday scenarios to pressure Republicans into backing down.""We've passed the only bill that can avert a government shutdown Monday night. I've said this on the floor -- I say it again: This is it"" Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said.Earlier Friday Reid narrowly won approval to restore funding for ObamaCare. The 54-44 vote fell along party lines.That was after the Senate voted 79-19 on the initial version of the bill which in its original form would keep the government open while defunding ObamaCare. Several Republicans joined Democrats in voting ""yes"" on that vote ignoring appeals by Cruz and other conservatives to stall the bill.The first roll call had put Republicans in a difficult position and prompted a very-public spate of infighting. Tea Party-aligned Republicans like Cruz who staged a 21-hour anti-ObamaCare speech on the Senate floor this week argued that Republicans should stop this bill in its tracks. Though the bill technically defunded ObamaCare -- which Cruz and his colleagues wanted -- they argued that since Reid would restore the funding they should vote ""no.""A number of Republicans rejected this logic.""I don't understand how I can otherwise vote on a matter that I want to see passed"" Sen. John Cornyn R-Texas said. (Click to see the vote breakdown.)Though the test vote put Senate Republicans in a tricky spot the bigger question is what House Republicans will do next.If Republicans stand by their demand that ObamaCare be defunded delayed or otherwise undermined then the two chambers could easily be at an impasse by midnight on Monday.Tempers and rhetoric were heated on Friday as Democrats accused their Republican colleagues of playing with legislative fire.""We are at one of the most dangerous points in our history right now -- every bit as dangerous as the break-up of the Union before the Civil War"" said Sen. Tom Harkin D-Iowa.But Republicans are treating their push to defund ObamaCare with urgency in part because a key part of the law is set to go into effect next week.""ObamaCare is the biggest job killer in the country"" Cruz said.",1
723,WASHINGTON — Even with its health insurance marketplace floundering for the fourth week the Obama administration is resisting what some Democratic allies contend is the most logical response to the problem: giving consumers more time to sign up.According to insurers and the White house delaying the deadline could undermine efforts to lure a broad young and healthy mix of consumers to the market. That would end up costing insurers and possibly taxpayers money.The case against delay was outlined in a memo circulated to lawmakers by the insurance lobby last week. The document from America’s Health Insurance Plans warned that delay could have a “destabilizing effect on insurance markets resulting in higher premiums and coverage disruptions for individuals and families.”For now the administration is sticking with the insurers. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on Wednesday called delaying the tax penalties for those who miss the deadline premature. Testifying before a House committee Sebelius said she was confident the site would be running smoothly by the end of November giving consumers four months to enroll easily online before the deadline of March 31.AdvertisementPresident Obama made the case in Boston where he argued that the model for his healthcare law — the 2006 Massachusetts law that then-Gov. Mitt Romney pushed through — experienced a similarly slow rollout and went on to success.There is more than policy keeping the administration from pursuing what some contend is a simple fix. House Republicans have long pushed to delay the mandate. Any concession on the point would hand another “I told you so” moment to the GOP only weeks after the White House and Democrats watched the government shut down rather than agree to Republicans’ demands to suspend the mandate for a year.Still the politics of the issue could change quickly as Democrats face pressure to show they are responding to public frustration with the website. Ten Democratic senators have signed a letter asking the White House to extend the date beyond March 31 — six of those are up for reelection in 2014.Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) said an extended enrollment was merely a fair way to make up for a website rollout she labeled a “disaster.” Millions of people have been shut out of the site intended to link consumers with private health plans. “That is unacceptable; consumers should not pay a penalty because a website did not work” Shaheen wrote in an op-ed published Wednesday in USA Today.AdvertisementAdvocates for the extension note that the administration has already pushed back the date by six weeks in an attempt to align mismatched deadlines outlined during the rule-making process. Another limited extension is unlikely to change consumer behavior much some experts opposed to a delay concede.“To change sends a message: Don’t worry about signing up quickly. So there is an impact but it depends a lot on how long an extension it is” said Linda Blumberg a health policy expert at the Urban Institute.Blumberg said it was too soon to know whether an extension was necessary. Any decision should come only after insurers know who is signing up and whether they are seeing too many sick customers to deliver on the premiums they’ve promised. There are two major provisions already built into the law to help insurers adjust for risk pools she said.Obama advisors made similar arguments. Extending the enrollment period by a few months or a year increases the possibility that people won’t sign up until they’re too sick increasing the costs for everyone else said Chris Jennings a former advisor to President Clinton now working on Obamacare implementation.AdvertisementEnforcing the requirements for insurers without enforcing those for individuals would compound the destabilizing effect Jennings said.“No one will sell you house insurance when your house is on fire” he said. “If you want to ban discrimination against people with preexisting conditions then you have to have everyone in the pool. That’s why you need the individual responsibility requirement.”Critics of the president’s law are reviving the push to undo the mandate. Romney issued a statement Wednesday suggesting a number of changes including “carefully phasing it in to avoid the type of disruptions we are seeing nationally.”In support of the Obama plan some former Romney advisors have stepped forward to counsel patience through what they suggest is just a rocky beginning.AdvertisementThe law ramped up slowly in Massachusetts said Jonathan Gruber an MIT economist who has advised Romney and Obama on healthcare reform.In the first month of enrollment in 2006 he said only 123 enrollees from the premium-paying population — comparable to the group using the marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act — signed up. That represented fewer than 1% of those who eventually signed up within the enrollment period.“The fact that people aren’t signed up now for a policy they can’t even get until January and which they’re not mandated to have until March is not at all interesting or important” Gruber said on a White House conference call held as Obama prepared to travel to Boston. “What matters is the fact that it will ramp up and it will ramp up over time.”The arc of enrollment in Massachusetts suggests that the deadline itself plays an important role he said.AdvertisementAs the program neared the deadline he said “you saw an enormous increase in healthy people signing up.”In their push on Capitol Hill insurers are arguing that the March 31 date is crucial to the assumptions they used in developing the premiums they are offering at healthcare.gov.According to America’s Health Insurance Plans the industry group changing these “vital enrollment incentives” would mean the premiums that health plans filed for next year would have to increase to account for fewer young and healthy people signing up for coverage. Insurers must determine the premiums for 2015 in April a deadline that would be hard to meet without knowing who had signed up in 2014.“Extending the open enrollment period would also drive up the 2015 premium rates” the group’s document says “as health plans would have to start submitting premiums to regulators before knowing who is enrolled in their insurance plans.”Advertisementkathleen.kennessey@latimes.comchristi.parsons@latimes.comthe group’s document says “as health plans would have to start submitting premiums to regulators before knowing who is enrolled in their insurance plans.”kathleen.kennessey@latimes.comAdvertisementchristi.parsons@latimes.com,1
724,Story highlights An unbalanced insurance pool could lead to higher premiums insurers pulling out CBO estimates nine million people will enroll in Medicaid or partner program for children 2010 Supreme Court decision overturned mandatory plan for states to expand Medicaid Many insurers and state-based exchanges don't consider customers enrolled until they pay first(CNN) —They are the numbers we’ve all been waiting for and House Republicans have unsuccessfully tried to get out of the Obama administration.This week the Department of Health and Human Services will reveal how many people purchased policies on the federal Obamacare exchange website.Technical failures have plagued HealthCare.gov since its October 1 launch although officials say it’s slowly getting better.White House spokesman Jay Carney says enrollment numbers “will be lower than we hoped and we anticipated.”Democrats losing patience with ObamacareJust how low and what effect all of those online roadblocks had on enrollment remain to be seen.But what will the numbers mean about the health of Obamacare?Q: How many people need to enroll?The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that 24 million people will purchase insurance through an exchange by 2023 but just seven million will enroll during the initial sign-up window ending March 31.CBO’s estimate includes customers on both state-based and federally run insurance exchanges but not individuals who enroll in Medicaid.If that number is spread evenly over the course of the open enrollment period 1.16 million people would need to purchase insurance each month in order for the administration to be on pace to reach the seven million figure in six months.But officials both in and out of government are quick to point out that enrollment is unlikely to occur at an even pace.Pro-Obamacare group raises $27 million for outreachTo make that case President Barack Obama recently traveled to Massachusetts where then-Gov. Mitt Romney enacted similar health care reforms in 2006.“Enrollment was extremely slow within a month only about a hundred people had signed up” the President told a crowd in Boston in late October recounting data from the state’s first open-enrollment period. “But then 2000 had signed up and then a few more thousand after that. And by the end of the year 36000 people had signed up.”On CNN the day after the President’s trip MIT economist Jon Gruber a former health care adviser to both Romney and Obama argued that the first month’s numbers aren’t that useful in estimating the pace of enrollment.“The key deadline here is March 31 that’s when people have to have insurance to avoid the individual mandate” Gruber said of the deadline for avoiding a financial penalty for not having any health coverage. “That’s still months away.”A consumer behavior expert said the slow pace of enrollment early could be attributed to buying habits.Michael McCall consumer psychology professor at Ithaca College compared it to paying rent or a mortgage when it’s due rather than before a bill is received. Until payment is submitted the door remains open to back out or make changes.“Once I pay I’ve kind of made that commitment” McCall added.Arguably more important than the overall enrollment number is the diversity of the new customer pool.The administration is working to ensure that 40% of those on the new exchanges are relatively healthy between 18 and 35.“Part of the challenge is to make sure that the exchanges are able to attract a broad cross section of people sick people and healthier young people so that the coverage is affordable” said Drew Altman president and CEO of the Kaiser Family Foundation.An unbalanced insurance pool could cause insurers to increase monthly premiums or pull out of the exchanges altogether in future years.Clinton: Obama should honor commitments on keeping health plansWhat about Medicaid enrollees?Customers whose income falls below a certain threshold are automatically referred to their state’s Medicaid program. The Affordable Care Act offers subsidies to states to increase Medicaid qualification to 138% of the federal poverty level and 25 states and the District of Columbia have taken up the federal offer so far.If your state has opted to expand Medicaid you’ll likely be referred to your state’s welfare agency if you make less than $15800 and are seeking coverage as an individual or $32500 if you’re seeking it for a family of four.The CBO estimates that nine million people will enroll in Medicaid and its partner initiative for children the Children’s Health Insurance Program by 2014. According to this estimate that number will increase to 13 million by 2023.Media report: Fewer than 50000 signed up for ObamacareWhat if my state didn’t expand Medicaid?The authors of the ACA intended Medicaid expansion to be mandatory but a Supreme Court decision in 2010 ruled the federal government couldn’t require expansion of a state-run program. This decision led 25 states to opt out.If you make less than the federal poverty level you will be referred to your state Medicaid agency to see if you qualify for benefits under the current law regardless of whether your state has expanded Medicaid or not.According to a study by the Kaiser Foundation only four states that didn’t expand Medicaid offer benefits to parents with incomes up to the federal poverty level and only Wisconsin offers benefits to adults without children.If your state chose not to expand its Medicaid program you can still purchase insurance on the exchange but you might not qualify for a premium subsidy.Federal subsidies kick in for those with income above 100% of the federal poverty level.Due to the Supreme Court decision and the structure of the law a large group of low-income Americans won’t qualify for Medicaid in their state but will earn less than the federal poverty level meaning they won’t qualify for any federal subsidies. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation roughly five million people will fall into this Medicaid coverage gap.What does “enroll” mean anyway?Regardless of whether you’re signing up on HealthCare.gov or one of the state-run exchanges there are several steps in the enrollment process.You must first create an account and enter in some personal information including your Social Security number and an estimate of your annual income.This information is then verified through the federal data hub with various government agencies such as the Social Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service.Then you’ll either be presented with the plans available in your coverage area and an estimate for what those plans will cost after any federal subsidy is factored in or you’ll be told you qualify for Medicaid and referred to your state’s Medicaid agency.If you’re eligible to purchase a plan on the exchange you can compare the plans available to find one that best fits your budget and coverage needs.Many insurance companies and state-based exchanges don’t classify customers as officially enrolled until they’ve paid their first premium. Others will count people as enrolled once they’ve selected a plan.A spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services confirmed Tuesday that the numbers the government plans to announce will reveal how many consumers have completed an application and selected a plan not necessarily how many have paid.Consumers have until December 15 to pay if they want coverage beginning on January 1 or until March 31 if they simply want to avoid paying the penalty for not having insurance.According to CNN’s tally at least 54700 people have paid for insurance on the state-based exchanges but many more have made it partially through the process completing an application and selecting a plan.Various news outlets have reported that fewer than 50000 people have signed up and paid for new private insurance plans through the federal marketplace HealthCare.gov. Neither the Department of Health and Human Services nor officials at CMS would confirm those numbers.,1
725,"WASHINGTON -- A crack appeared Wednesday morning in the conservatives' united front against President Barack Obama in the budget-and-borrowing crisis of 2013.Michael Needham CEO of the powerful group Heritage Action said that he opposed conditioning a crucial vote to increase the government's borrowing authority on the group's main goal: defunding Obamacare.Under questioning at a breakfast with reporters hosted by the Christian Science Monitor Needham a product of the Stanford Business School conceded that failure to raise the debt ceiling would indeed disrupt the global economy.""I'm sure the markets will react negatively"" he said even if as he suggested was possible the Treasury could ""prioritize"" interest payments to foreign bondholders.Rather than try to hold the debt ceiling vote hostage to the defunding of Obamacare he said the better ""tactical"" course for Heritage and other key foes of the administration is to continue to focus on annual spending -- and on allowing the full opening of government only if Obamacare is dismantled.""No we should raise the debt limit"" he said though he added that he would oppose an increase that extends until after the 2014 election which is Obama's preferred outcome.But with regards to the government shutdown Needham insisted that his group would continue to oppose any continuing resolution -- no matter how short in duration -- that did not defund the health care law.""My tactic is to focus on the CR"" he said.Matt Kibbe the president and CEO of the influential conservative group FreedomWorks also said in a Wednesday interview with The Huffington Post that the debt ceiling should be raised in order to keep the Obamacare fight focused on the continuing resolution.""This is an emerging set of opinions that looks to be where everybody's gravitating to"" he said.Heritage Action funded by small donors corporate allies and wealthy individuals Needham refused to name -- other than the Koch Brothers who he said had given $500000 -- has become a powerhouse in a new generation of conservative groups.It operates on a model developed by Evangelical activists producing informative -- and politically inflammatory -- ""scorecards"" that rate lawmakers' ideological purity based on their many votes.The group organized a series of public events and town halls this summer to oppose Obamacare which the group regards as the next camel's nose under the tent of a bankrupt entitlement state.Needham thinks that Social Security needs ""fundamental"" change and that other entitlement programs are unfairly burdening Millennials.But he indicated at the Wednesday breakfast that his disdain for Obamacare did not extend to the debt ceiling vote.That could give Obama and House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) at least a smidgen of room to maneuver if and when they decide to strike an overall deal: the White House could get a ""clean"" debt ceiling vote (though of short duration) and the GOP could get a concession or two on the continuing resolution to fund the government's annual spending.",0
726,A willow not an oak. So said conservatives of Chief Justice John Roberts when he rescued the Affordable Care Act (ACA) — a.k.a. Obamacare — from being found unconstitutional.But the manner in which he did this may have made the ACA unworkable thereby putting it on a path to ultimate extinction.This plausible judgment comes from professor Thomas A. Lambert of the University of Missouri Law School writing in Regulation a quarterly publication of the libertarian Cato Institute.The crucial decision he says was four liberal justices joining Roberts’s opinion declaring that the ACA’s penalty for not complying with the mandate to purchase health insurance is actually a tax on not purchasing it. With this reasoning the court severely limited the ability of the new health-care regime to cope with its own predictable consequences.What was supposed to be constitutionally the dispositive question turned out not to be. Conservatives said that the mandate — the requirement that people engage in commerce by purchasing health insurance — exceeded Congress’s enumerated power to regulate interstate commerce. Liberals ridiculed this argument noting that since the judicial revolution wrought during the New Deal courts have given vast deference to Congress regarding that power. The ridicule stopped when five justices including Roberts agreed with the conservative argument.1 of 42 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Tom Toles on health care View Photos A collection of cartoons on the debate. Caption A collection of cartoons on the debate. Wait 1 second to continue.This did not however doom the ACA because Roberts invoked what Lambert calls “a longstanding interpretive canon that calls for the court if possible to interpret statutes in a way that preserves their constitutionality.” Roberts did this by ruling that what Congress called a “penalty” for not obeying the mandate was really a tax on noncompliance.This must Lambert thinks have momentous — and deleterious — implications for the functioning of the ACA. The problems arise from the interplay of two ACA provisions — “guaranteed issue” and “community rating.”The former forbids insurance companies from denying coverage because of a person’s preexisting health condition. The latter says Lambert requires insurers to price premiums “solely on the basis of age smoker status and geographic area without charging higher premiums to sick people or those susceptible to sickness.”The point of the penalty to enforce the mandate was to prevent healthy people — particularly healthy young people — from declining to purchase insurance or dropping their insurance which would leave an insured pool of mostly old and infirm people. This would cause the cost of insurance premiums to soar making it more and more sensible for the healthy to pay the ACA tax which is much less than the price of insurance.Roberts noted that a person earning $35000 a year would pay a $60 monthly tax and someone earning $100000 would pay $200. But the cost of a qualifying insurance policy is projected to be $400 a month. Clearly it would be sensible to pay $60 or $200 rather than $400 because if one becomes ill “guaranteed issue” assures coverage and “community rating” means that one’s illness will not result in higher insurance rates.So Lambert says the ACA’s penalties are too low to prod the healthy to purchase insurance even given ACA’s subsidies for purchasers. The ACA’s authors probably understood this perverse incentive and assumed that once Congress passed the ACA with penalties low enough to be politically palatable Congress could increase them.But Roberts’s decision limits Congress’s latitude by holding that the small size of the penalty is part of the reason it is for constitutional purposes a tax. It is not a “financial punishment” because it is not so steep that it effectively prohibits the choice of paying it. And Roberts noted “by statute it can never be more.”As Lambert says the penalty for refusing to purchase insurance counts as a tax only if it remains so small as to be largely ineffective.Unable to increase penalties substantially Congress in the context of “guaranteed issue” and “community rating” has only one way to induce healthy people to purchase insurance. This is by the hugely expensive process of increasing premium subsidies enough to make negligible the difference between the cost of insurance to purchasers and the penalty for not purchasing. Republicans will ferociously resist exacerbating the nation’s financial crisis in order to rescue the ACA.Because the penalties are constitutionally limited by the reasoning whereby Roberts declared them taxes he may have saved the ACA’s constitutionality by sacrificing its feasibility. So as the president begins his second term the signature achievement of his first term looks remarkably rickety.,1

728,"By Tom Brown MIAMI (Reuters) - Florida's leading health insurer is reaching out to hundreds of thousands of state residents touting temporary relief from what it describes as an imminent spike in premium rates due to President Barack Obama's signature healthcare reform law. ""When the new healthcare law takes effect you may be surprised how much more you could pay for health insurance"" says an advisory to consumers from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida also known as Florida Blue. ""Find out how much you'll save if you buy now"" adds the advisory which has been mailed over the past month to homes of existing policyholders and potential new clients. ""Let us help you get the best deal on health insurance right now"" the notice says. ""We can even tell you if you can get help paying for coverage from the government."" Under Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act millions of uninsured Americans will be able to buy government-subsidized health coverage on new online state insurance exchanges beginning on October 1. The cost of the new plans which require insurers to provide more benefits to consumers and bar the exclusion of people with prior illnesses is a key factor to making the enrollment effort a success. However the law also allows consumers to select from existing individual insurance policies now and extend them into 2014. While these existing policies may be cheaper in some states than those under the Obamacare reform plan many may not contain the same comprehensive benefits. Florida Blue's notice marks one of the more aggressive efforts by an insurer to tap into fears of ""sticker shock"" for the newer Obamacare plans. Republican-led Florida refused to set up its own insurance exchange leaving the job to the federal government. The enrollment stakes are big in the Sunshine State where the U.S. Census Bureau says there are about 3.8 million people without health insurance. About a quarter of Florida's population is uninsured giving it the third-highest rate in the country. Florida's insurance regulators have said the cost of new insurance plans may rise 30 to 40 percent when compared with a fictional 2013 plan modeled to include the same benefits. But rates in the state are still being finalized between insurers and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Florida estimates don't include substantial subsidies that a majority of uninsured people may qualify for. Florida Blue said the advisory is part of a direct mail advertising campaign aimed at drumming up new business for the Jacksonville Florida-based giant which reported $8.9 billion in revenues last year and covers more than 4.3 million people in its primary health business in the state. The company a leading contributor to the political action committee of Florida's Republican Governor Rick Scott is one of nine insurers that have applied to sell non-group policies on the state's new marketplace and the only one that promises to cover every county in Florida. Craig Thomas the executive responsible for marketing and strategy at Florida Blue said the consumer advisory - unlike anything seen from other health insurance companies in Florida - was part of what he termed ""an appropriate marketing program."" It primarily targets many people purchasing coverage in Florida's individual market today who will be ineligible for premium subsidies under Obamacare Thomas said. Many of those same consumers will be hit with higher rates because of benefit changes and other factors tied to next year's full implementation of the law he said. ""Their rates are generally going to go up"" said Thomas. ""New expenses are going to be reflected in next year's premiums."" HURTING ENROLLMENT Federal and consumer groups dispute the state's projections. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told reporters on a recent Florida visit that competition for customers should help keep premiums in check. An HHS spokeswoman declined to comment on the Florida Blue campaign which comes against the backdrop of a full-court press by Scott and other Republican leaders in the state to undermine Obamacare. But Ron Pollack who heads Families USA the national healthcare consumer advocacy group strongly criticized the campaign and said it could hurt enrollment in Florida for coverage under the president's reform plan. ""This letter from an insurer that has tried to appear helpful to consumers is outrageous misleading and for many totally erroneous"" Pollack told Reuters. ""People who get suckered into this appeal may very well lose many thousands of dollars in premium subsidies that become available soon if they enroll starting on October 1 in health coverage through the Affordable Care Act"" he said. Republican opponents of the reform law were the driving force behind Florida Senate Bill 1842. Signed into law by Governor Scott in May the legislation prohibits Florida's Office of Insurance Regulation from providing any real protection for consumers from unreasonably high health insurance rates. The federal government says it lacks the legal authority to regulate insurance premiums in individual states though it is trying to persuade insurers to alter higher-priced plans when it can. Sebelius who has said she was ""baffled"" by Florida's move commented earlier this month that she knew of no other state that had chosen to eliminate its own regulatory oversight leaving consumers at the mercy of health insurance companies. ""It's really unconscionable that the Florida legislature and Governor Scott would take what is in essence the insurance cop regulating insurance companies off the playing field take that cop off the beat ... It just doesn't make sense for families or small businesses. They're supposed to be on our side"" said Tampa's U.S. Representative Kathy Castor. Castor Debbie Wasserman Schultz and seven other Florida Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives sent a letter to Sebelius decrying their state's deregulation of health insurers as ""a cynical and intentional effort by Governor Scott and the Florida legislature to undermine the Affordable Care Act and make health insurance premiums more expensive on the Florida Health Insurance Marketplace."" The same law that curtails Florida's rate-setting authority requires insurers to issue notices to consumers blaming hikes in premiums on ""the impact of federal healthcare reform."" A copy of one such notice which all health insurance companies operating in the state will be required to use was made available to Reuters by the insurance commissioner's office. Thomas who spoke in a telephone interview with Reuters from Jacksonville said many Florida consumers could benefit financially from buying policies now even though the plans would expire under Obamacare with no chance of renewal. ""The benefits and rates they buy now would not be changed until the product anniversary date gets here next summer"" Thomas said. It will carry them with their current program well into next year"" he added. He and other company officials declined to comment on how Florida Blue's premiums in 2014 would compare to existing rates. (Editing by Ken Wills)",0
729,"Glenn Harlan ReynoldsThe moon landing was one of the last times the government delivered a big program ahead of schedule.As it%27s gotten bigger%2C the federal government appears to have gotten less competent.Obama within the government is a technological embarrassment.So the Obamacare website doesn't work and nobody knows when it'll be fixed. Administration officials are pointing toward late November but they've had more than three years to work on it. In about the same amount of time after John F. Kennedy's ""we choose to go to the moon"" speech we'd already put people into orbit and brought them safely to earth. It was obviously the signature effort of the Obama administration but it was a flop. Forget launching to the moon; we can't even launch a website now. What does that tell us?Well don't blame Obama too much. It certainly tells us that the government has trouble executing the things it decides to do. But it wasn't always that way. Even for Obama.The 1960s space program of course is a classic example of big government doing something successfully: Promising to put men on the moon within a decade and doing it. But there are others.Not far from me is Norris Dam the very first dam built by the Tennessee Valley Authority. It was filled in 1936 less than three years after the Tennessee Valley Authority Act passed Congress. Note that it was not less than three years after construction started but less than three years after the act creating the agency that built it passed Congress. Norris Dam worked and it's still there today more than 70 years later.The Obamacare website -- which took longer to create -- doesn't work and certainly won't be around in 70 years. And if you think about it it seems like the moon landing was one of the last times the federal government delivered a big successful program ahead of schedule. I can't think of many others since.Unlike Norris Dam the Olmsted Dam and Locks on the Ohio River were authorized by Congress in 1988 but a quarter-century later the project is only half-done. It has also overrun its budget by a factor of four.Meanwhile most of the interesting stuff being done in outer space is being done by private companies. (In fact President Obama's space policy approach which emphasizes private enterprise is one of his greatest policy successes.)As it's gotten bigger the federal government appears to have gotten less competent. Apollo was a success on its own terms but the big government policies that followed -- the War On Poverty the War On Drugs the War On Cancer -- have all been pretty much failures sometimes disastrous ones.Even Obama himself is evidence of this problem. His 2012 presidential campaign was famous for its mastery of technology building up an electronic campaign infrastructure in just a few months that helped him win the election. But of course it wasn't a government operation. Obama without the government -- a technological success. Obama within the government -- a technological embarrassment. The difference between success and failure here as even Obama-haters will have to admit wasn't Obama. It's more likely that a political campaign has clear goals and lots of freedom to improvise while a federal program is much more encumbered by law and bureaucracy.Whatever the cause it remains indisputable that the federal government isn't very good at delivering on big projects. The obvious response is to not entrust the federal government with big projects on which it can't deliver. Instead they should be left to those who can.Will our political and pundit class draw the obvious lesson here?

730,WASHINGTON — Jeffrey D. Zients a multimillionaire entrepreneur and management consultant joined the Obama White House in 2009 with a mandate to streamline the federal bureaucracy. A year later he issued a prescient warning.The government “largely has missed out” on the information technology revolution Mr. Zients said in a 2010 internal memo. “I.T. projects too often cost hundreds of millions of dollars more than they should take years longer than necessary to deploy and deliver technologies that are obsolete by the time they are completed” he wrote.These days Mr. Zients is witnessing that ineptitude up close as the emergency fix-it man charged with righting HealthCare.gov the bungled online marketplace for medical insurance. He is to become President Obama’s top economic adviser in January but first he is leading the so-called tech surge to haul HealthCare.gov into the 21st century. Ignoring friends who told him not to get mixed up in the website fiasco Mr. Zients (pronounced ZYE-ents) promises it will run “smoothly for the vast majority of users” by the end of November — a schedule considered highly optimistic.Mr. Obama’s reputation and the electoral fortunes of Democrats could hinge on the work of Mr. Zients a man who has no hands-on technology experience — although he has advised health care companies on business practices. In the universe of experts who might have been called in for rescue work Democrats close to the administration say there were others perhaps more qualified than Mr. Zients but he was the best of those Mr. Obama and an insular White House were comfortable with.,1
731,‘Tis the season of giving charity and good will — unless you happen to be a Republican and then ‘tis the season of pusillanimity churlishness and bad will.Congressional Republicans seem hell-bent on denying the most disadvantaged among us healthcare unemployment benefits and perhaps worst of all food stamps from which the House of Representatives slashed $40 billion last month. Elizabeth Drew writing in Rolling Stone calls it “The Republicans’ War on the Poor.”You can attribute these benefit cuts to plain meanness with a dose of political calculation thrown in as Drew does. But there may be another explanation than congenital cruelty: Republicans believe they are adhering to a principle that they place above every other value including compassion. That principle is the need to punish individuals whom they view as undeserving.Though we Americans love to brag about our decency and concern for others the punitive gene runs deep in our national DNA. It goes back to the Puritans who while professing charitableness and community had a hard vision of life. They subscribed to the Protestant idea that since you couldn’t know if you were one of the “elect” predestined for salvation you had to look for signs. A major one is a productive life.The sociologist Max Weber fastened on this Protestant work ethic as the basis of Western civilization’s material success. As he saw it capitalism was a by-product of the desire for grace. For the Protestants hard work was not only a potential sign of personal salvation. It became a sign of national salvation.The United States was particularly fertile ground for this. It was not only a Protestant nation it took pride in being a classless society a meritocracy — in which the secular elect would become just as important as the religious. The country’s governing principle was and still is that anyone can make it here if he or she is just willing to put in the necessary elbow grease.This may be why no country seems to worship success as much as the United States. Our success is always perceived to be earned. This is American bedrock — our primary myth remains the social mobility of the Horatio Alger stories.But if the work ethic was secularized and popularized it was also politicized. If every individual was responsible for his or her own destiny — short of natural disasters which some conservatives see as divine punishment for various cultural transgressions — there was no need for government interventions to redress inequalities.In a world where everyone is on their own help is not just wasteful; it is ungodly and un-American. If we are responsible for our success we are also responsible for our failure.It is impossible to know whether the modern Republican Party exploited self-reliance to destroy big government or sought to destroy big government as a principle of self-reliance. Whichever this is now deeply embedded in modern conservatism.When U.S. conservatives cut unemployment benefits it is because giving the unemployed money allegedly discourages them from working. When they cut food stamps it is because they claim recipients are gaming the system though there is virtually no evidence to support this. Representative Jack Kingston (R-Ga.) a Senate candidate proposed last week that any child receiving lunches through the federal school lunch program be required to work to earn the food.But Republicans wouldn’t be proposing these hardships if there weren’t a sizable contingent of Americans supporting them. Presumably on the basis that the disadvantaged aren’t really disadvantaged. They are unworthy.Slashing benefits is only cruel if you are hurting the deserving. But in the conservatives’ view the poor are never deserving. So you can hack away with a sense of righteousness. Poverty they insist is a choice.This may help explain the conservatives’ anger at anyone who purports to help the poor. Doing so violates the sense of justice for many on the right. It isn’t just that conservatives hate government for taking taxpayers’ hard-earned dollars. They hate it because it rewards indolence — where politics conjoins with sinfulness.This has a powerful appeal. And it goes a long way toward answering the liberal quandary of why so many Americans who could benefit from government programs oppose them and work against their own self-interest.The answer goes back to those Puritan roots. We are a nation of scolds and scourges. We hate the idea that someone can get something he or she didn’t earn. So what’s the matter with Kansas may just be that many Americans believe in something more important than self-interest more important than compassion. Punishment.Many Americans certainly many Republicans are more interested in making sure that the “undeserving” are not being rewarded than making sure the deserving are rewarded.Sure it is punitive. Meting out punishment however is something we love to do. Which is why one of our major political parties can subsist on it. The Republican Party is the punishment party.All this is worth remembering at this time of year. We may say we like giving. But a whole lot of us resent the taking. Or put another way it is better to give so long as no one needs to receive.PHOTO: House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) (C) is flanked by House Majority Whip Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.)

732,"By Caroline Humer (Reuters) - The hundreds of thousands of Americans whose individual insurance policies will be canceled as Obamacare takes full effect next year are experiencing a disruptive element of healthcare reform the head of health insurer Cigna said on Thursday. In the past week reports of pending plan cancellations have become a political problem for President Barack Obama who promised years ago as he was pushing to pass the healthcare law that Americans who liked their health plans could keep them. While that remains true for most people with insurance a small percentage of the 17 million Americans with individual policies are now getting notice that they will terminate next year because they do not comply with new benefits required by Obamacare. Many insurers are offering new compliant policies to replace those that are expiring but they may be significantly more expensive. Nearly half of U.S. consumers with individual health plans are also expected to qualify for tax credits to buy insurance on new state exchanges under Obamacare. ""When you are that individual who has a benefit plan and it's working for you and your family at your current life stage and you are told that you no longer have that choice that's disruptive and that's the environment that as a country we are going through right now"" Cigna Chief Executive David Cordani said in an interview. Cigna had about 232000 people in individual policies at the end of September according to company filings. Competitor WellPoint Inc which operates 14 Blue Cross Blue Shield licenses including the Anthem and Empire brands has about 1.8 million people in individual plans. Aetna Inc which bought smaller insurer Coventry earlier this year has 650000 members in these plans and will drop about 50000 members when it exits the California market at the end of this year. In defending the healthcare law on Wednesday Obama said it was not to blame for the plan cancellations and that the real fault lies with ""bad apple"" insurers who were allowed to sell cut-rate policies that offered minimal coverage for people when they needed them the most. Cordani declined to comment on Obama's remarks but noted that individual plans have been subjected to numerous new requirements under the law. States determine the minimum eligible benefits and there are federal requirements so in some states elements such as the size of the deductible could disqualify an individual plan for 2014. ""It's as simple as that"" he said. WellPoint and Aetna declined to comment on specifics about policy cancellations or about the president's comments. Cordani said that Cigna has a small individual insurance business and is not significantly impacted by needing to cancel these plans. In addition it has about 125000 employer-sponsored plans that will end on January 1 2014 because they do not comply with the law. These plans typically targeted seasonal or hourly workers he said and it was clear from when the health reform law was passed in 2010 that they were going away.

733,Rep. Paul D. Ryan the former Republican vice presidential candidate has been a tea party favorite and a bridge between House conservatives and the party leadership ever since he took the lead in crafting a plan to scale back Medicare and other social programs to reduce federal spending.But on Wednesday when Ryan (R-Wis.) stepped forward to try to bring Republican factions together behind a strategy to end the government’s latest budget stalemate some of the same conservatives who once trusted him went cold.AdvertisementThe complaint: His plan which centered on trimming back spending on government entitlement programs failed to mention the demise of Obamacare as a top Republican objective. Conservatives accused him of abandoning their cause and caving in to Democrats.“So we are going to ditch the fight over Obamacare which is extremely unpopular to fight for Medicare reform? Really Paul Ryan? And they think we are politically stupid?” wrote Daniel Horowitz on RedState.com an influential conservative website.Advertisement“This is the road to cave city” he said.The heated reaction showed how deeply divided Republicans remain in the second week of the government shutdown — with a week to go before the nation could run out of money to pay its bills.AdvertisementHouse GOP leaders have been trying to shift the focus of their standoff with the White House and Senate Democrats away from Sen. Ted Cruz’s drive to stop the president’s health law to a broader plan to cut the budget. But partly as a result the majority led by House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) can no longer explain what exactly it is fighting for.“There are a lot of ideas right now on the table” said Rep. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.). But he said Republicans hadn’t yet coalesced around one approach.AdvertisementOne way out would be a short-term agreement to raise the $16.7-trillion debt ceiling for a few weeks while both sides work on a broader budget agreement. Republicans are increasingly floating this proposal but Democrats are wary that the GOP will demand concessions.Senate Democrats are expected to vote this weekend on a proposal to suspend the debt limit through 2014.AdvertisementRepublican divisions over what they want from the White House have weakened their hand and made the stalemate harder to resolve. The party’s struggles could be seen in a new Gallup poll that put the GOP’s favorable rating at 28% the lowest measure for either political party since Gallup started asking the question in 1992 — lower even than the GOP’s standing during the last government shutdowns in 1995 and 1996.Ryan defended his approach on conservative commentator Bill Bennett’s radio show. “I don’t know that within the next two weeks we have a viable strategy for actually repealing Obamacare every piece of it” he said.AdvertisementThe conservative Heritage Action which helped launch the strategy taken by tea party favorite Cruz (R-Texas) said any action short of a fight over the Affordable Care Act would be “detrimental.”“Fundamentally we are not supportive of anything that’s going to take the focus away from the current fight over Obamacare” said Heritage’s Dan Holler. “That’s where we think the fight needs to be — that’s where the fight is.”AdvertisementAt the same time top conservatives especially those tired of the Cruz-led campaign heaped praise on Ryan as the party’s expert on fiscal issues. “Excellent piece by @RepPaulRyan on a path forward” tweeted Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) once a leader among House conservatives.But two-term Rep. Mo Brooks a Republican from Alabama called Ryan’s brief presentation before the House GOP’s conservative caucus Wednesday “very generic” and walked away undecided on whether he would sign on.Advertisement“The devil’s in the details” Brooks said. “Delaying socialized medicine — that is one way to delay one’s insolvency.”As Boehner struggled to find a cohesive strategy the White House sought to amplify Obama’s willingness to negotiate with Congress once it passes bills to end the shutdown and avert a default. The president invited every Republican in the House to meet with him Thursday at the White House. He held a similar session with Democrats on Wednesday.AdvertisementBoehner however decided to limit the White House session to a few top House Republicans. One GOP leadership aide said that a broader meeting would be little more than a “photo op.”The decision “disappointed” Obama the White House spokesman said. “The president thought it was important to talk directly with the members who forced this economic crisis on the country about how the shutdown and a failure to pay the country’s bills could devastate the economy” said White House Press Secretary Jay Carney.AdvertisementObama has refused to engage in serious talks until Republicans agree to reopen the government and raise the debt limit. “The president will talk to anyone any time and looks forward to their visit to the White House but will not pay the Republicans ransom for doing their job” Carney said.Splinters among Democrats who have publicly maintained an unusually united front also emerged Wednesday as liberals warned against budget talks that could result in steep cuts to cherished government programs.AdvertisementRep. Raul M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.) co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus has called those fears “grand bargain paranoia.” Democrats worry based on past talks aimed at a so-called grand bargain that the president might be willing to reduce Social Security benefits or increase the amount of money higher-income seniors pay toward Medicare.But Democrats appeared unified Wednesday as senators rallied on the Capitol steps and House Democrats met with Obama. “The debt ceiling needs to be lifted. They’re not getting anything for that” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) as she left the White House with her leadership team.AdvertisementThe reemergence of Ryan whose role had faded since the January day when he led rebellious House Republicans back from the brink of an earlier fiscal standoff still holds the potential to shift the debate.Ryan’s prescriptions spelled out in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal reflect Boehner’s interest in a deal that could provide what the budget chairman has called a “big down payment” on the nation’s debt.AdvertisementRyan said Wednesday that he was “totally committed to dismantling” the healthcare law. “Obamacare is an entitlement just like any other entitlement. So that as far as we’re concerned is in this conversation” he said on Bennett’s radio show. “Ultimately we have to rethink all of our nation’s healthcare laws.”lisa.mascaro@latimes.comAdvertisementmichael.memoli@latimes.comChristi Parsons and Brian Bennett in the Washington bureau contributed to this report.,0
734,"The premiums for coverage available on the health insurance exchanges created by President Barack Obama's health care reform law will vary widely from state to state according to a new Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of data published by 17 states and the District of Columbia.Retail prices for health insurance can be considerably different based in part on the cost of health care services where a person lives even within the same state the Kaiser Family Foundation reported Wednesday. Premiums also vary based on age family size and tobacco use. But under Obamacare prices cannot be based on someone's medical history and patients with preexisting condition cannot be turned away. The law also mandates a set of minimum benefits that includes hospitalizations prescription drugs and maternity care.The prices included in the report don't include health benefits provided by employers because the health insurance exchanges are intended for the uninsured and those who don't get job-based health plans.The actual premiums for the health plans on the exchanges have been a chief unknown since Obama enacted the health care law in 2010 and although complete information won't be available until the exchanges open the Kaiser Family Foundation examined detailed data published by state authorities to create a snapshot of what coverage will cost.In Baltimore a 40-year-old will be able to buy a so-called bronze health insurance plan for as little as $146 a month compared to $336 a month in Burlington Vt. not including the savings from tax credits available to people who earn up to four times the federal poverty level -- $45960 for a single person this year -- according to the report.The health insurance exchanges in all 50 states and the District of Columbia are slated to open Oct. 1 for small businesses uninsured people and for people who don't get health benefits at work to comparison shop and to learn whether they qualify for financial assistance. People who get health benefits from large employers or who are enrolled in government programs like Medicare don't need to use the exchanges. Employers provide coverage to 150 million U.S. residents according to census data and virtually all large firms are expected to continue doing so next year despite the Obama administration's one-year delay of the law's requirement that large companies cover workers or pay a penalty.The exchanges will sell four tiers of health insurance -- bronze silver gold and platinum -- indicating how generous the coverage is. Bronze plans will tend to have the lowest premiums but expose consumers to the highest possible out-of-pocket costs and platinum plans will have the highest prices but the lowest additional expenses. Those younger than 30 can purchase so-called catastrophic insurance with minimal coverage at a lower price but cannot apply federal tax credits to these plans.The Kaiser Family Foundation didn't compare the premiums on the health insurance exchange with the cost of health insurance for those who don't get health benefits at work today however. The new law's guaranteed benefits prohibition against turning down people with preexisting conditions will make health insurance on this market too different from what's currently available the report says.""These changes make direct comparisons of exchange premiums and existing individual market premiums complicated and doing so would require speculative assumptions and data that are not publicly available"" it says. Some people most likely young adults who don't qualify for financial assistance may see higher prices as a result.The variation isn't limited to bronze plans the Kaiser Family Foundation analysis reveals. ""The lowest cost exchange silver exchange plan available range in cost for a 40-year-old from $194 per month in Portland Oregon to $395 per month for a 40-year-old in Burlington Vermont before tax credits"" the report says.Under Obamacare people whose incomes range from poverty $11490 for a single person this year and 400 percent of poverty may be eligible for tax credits to buy private insurance. Sixteen states and the District of Columbia are running their own exchanges while the federal government will at least partly manage exchanges also called marketplaces in the remaining states.""Most people buying their own insurance will qualify for premium tax credits which will significantly lower the cost of their premiums"" the Kaiser Family Foundation report says. The foundation also notes that premiums released so far are lower than projected by the Congressional Budget Office.People who earn up to 133 percent of poverty or $15282 for an individual this year can enroll in Medicaid if they live in the District of Columbia or one of the 24 states that are expanding the program under the law.The Kaiser Family Foundation examined insurance company filings to state regulators in 17 states and the District of Columbia and analyzed the prices in the largest cities in each jurisdiction for people at ages 25 40 and 60. At least two health insurance companies are offering products in all of the locations included in the report. California has the largest number of companies participating in its exchange Covered California at 12 while HealthSource RI in Rhode Island and Maine's federally run marketplace each have two companies.Eligibility for tax credits via the exchanges is determined based on the maximum amount of a person's income they must spend on health insurance and the price of the second-cheapest silver-level health insurance plan where they live. In addition to the tax credits for annual premiums people who earn up to two-and-a-half times poverty can qualify for additional subsidies to cover their out-of-pocket costs like copayments and deductibles. Most legal residents of the United States must obtain coverage or face a tax penalty under the law's individual mandate.The full Kaiser Family Foundation report includes breakdowns for each example in every one of the metropolitan areas examined.",1
735,"Be careful you don't fall off the Obamacare ""cliff"" when the boss asks you to put in some overtime.Working more could ultimately mean thousands of dollars less for you under a quirk in the new health-care law going into effect this fall. This could prompt some people to cut back on their hours to avoid losing money.""Working more can actually leave you worse off"" the price-comparison site ValuePenguin.com notes in a new analysis.""It's sort of an absurd scenario"" said Jonathan Wu ValuePenguin.com's co-founder. ""It's something for people to be aware of.""In that scenario an individual or family whose annual income surpasses maximums set by the federal government—if only by $1—will totally lose subsidies available to buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.(Read more: Obamacare fraud?)The loss of those subsidies in some cases will mean that people potentially would have been better off financially if they had worked less during the year Wu said. And they then would have to work significantly more to make up for the lost subsidy.""I think they'd be surprised to see how drastic it is"" said Wu. ""I'd be kind of shocked to see if I make $100 less (in total income each year) I get all these benefits but if I make $100 more I get nothing.""""You basically don't want to fall in that hole"" said Wu adding that he believed contractors and others with more control over their incomes would be apt to adjust their hours worked to avoid the subsidy cliff.He also said that because of lower insurance premiums often offered to younger people the effect will more likely be seen by older people. But ""you will see it across all age groups"" in the seven states including New York and Vermont where insurance premiums are either barred from being affected by age or restricted from being dramatically affected he said.Under the ACA federal subsidies in the form of tax credits to buy insurance on new state health insurance exchanges will be available to millions of people who can start enrolling on those exchanges Oct. 1. The subsidies are available to people or families whose incomes total 400 percent above the federal poverty level or less and are designed to cap their insurance premiums at 9.5 percent of their total income.For a single person that FPL income maximum is $45960 per year. The maximums are adjusted upward for couples and families until maxing out at $94200 for a family of four.(Read more: Doctors skeptical confused about Obamacare)Under a scenario that ValuePenguin.com identified a couple in Ohio both age 50 would be eligible for subsidies worth $3452 to purchase a so-called silver insurance plan—a moderately priced level of benefits under the ACA's scheme—that costs $9346 annually if they made up to $62040 per year.But if they made just $1 more than that they would lose the subsidy. Wu noted that the couple then would have to earn at least $65492 to make up for the lost subsidy.In New York a family of three whose annual income totals $78120 would pay $12784 for the second-lower-priced silver plan on that state's insurance exchange. After getting a $5363 tax credit the family's net cost for the insurance would be $7421.But if the family earned even slightly more than $78120 they would have to pay the entire $12784 for the insurance because they then wouldn't qualify for the subsidy.To make up for that the family's annual income would have to reach $83483 Wu said.The stark effect of peoples' age in determining their risk from the subsidy cliff is seen in two examples from Connecticut.(Read more: This could put Obamacare in the ER)There Wu said a 27-year-old single man would pay $3636 annually for the second-cheapest silver plan—less than the $4366 cap on insurance premiums for individuals earning $45960 or less annually. That person would not be eligible for subsidies and thus would see no disincentive in working more hours.But the annual premiums for a 50-year-old Connecticut couple buying that plan would be $12468. If their combined incomes were $62040 or less they would receive $6575 in subsidies to offset the cost.However if their income was more than that they would lose the subsidies leaving them out of pocket $6575. They then would have to earn at least $68615 to make up for that lost subsidy Wu said.",1
736,Leading Republicans appear to be nerving themselves up for another round of attempted fiscal blackmail. With the end of the fiscal year looming they aren’t offering the kinds of compromises that might produce a deal and avoid a government shutdown; instead they’re drafting extremist legislation — bills that would for example cut clean-water grants by 83 percent — that has no chance of becoming law. Furthermore they’re threatening once again to block any rise in the debt ceiling a move that would damage the U.S. economy and possibly provoke a world financial crisis.Yet even as Republican politicians seem ready to go on the offensive there’s a palpable sense of anxiety even despair among conservative pundits and analysts. Better-informed people on the right seem finally to be facing up to a horrible truth: Health care reform President Obama’s signature policy achievement is probably going to work.And the good news about Obamacare is I’d argue what’s driving the Republican Party’s intensified extremism. Successful health reform wouldn’t just be a victory for a president conservatives loathe it would be an object demonstration of the falseness of right-wing ideology. So Republicans are being driven into a last desperate effort to head this thing off at the pass.Some background: Although you’d never know it from all the fulminations with prominent Republicans routinely comparing Obamacare to slavery the Affordable Care Act is based on three simple ideas. First all Americans should have access to affordable insurance even if they have pre-existing medical problems. Second people should be induced or required to buy insurance even if they’re currently healthy so that the risk pool remains reasonably favorable. Third to prevent the insurance “mandate” from being too onerous there should be subsidies to hold premiums down as a share of income.,0

738,"House Speaker John Boehner has many competing interests to satisfy as he tries to come up with a way to defund Obamacare increase defense spending cut domestic spending and make the sequester levels of funding permanent all without being responsible for shutting down the government. So far it doesn't look like he's succeeding. By the end of the day Tuesday Boehner will present a plan that attempts to fake out Senate Democrats and force any possibility of a shutdown into their court.The plan reportedly is to pass what they're calling a ""clean"" continuing resolution bill for funding the government for the next three months that includes a separate House concurrent resolution to defund Obamacare. They would create a rule to govern debate on the bill that said the House wouldn't send the funding part of the bill over to the Senate until that body voted on the Obamacare defunding part of the bill. The Senate would vote down the defunding measure so they could go onto the spending bill. That would allow Republicans to declare that Senate Democrats ""own"" Obamacare a threat that said Democrats can probably live with.The proposal has gone over like a lead balloon with the far right. Club for Growth president Chris Chocola calls the proposal a ""bad joke"" and said ""[t]rying to fool Republicans into voting to fund ObamaCare is even worse than offering a bill that deliberately funds it."" Teabagger House members are also not mollified still demanding a continuing resolution that defunds Obamacare. Eighty of them signed a letter to Boehner to that effect and an aide told The Hill that they ""are still expected to vote against any continuing resolution that does not defund ObamaCare.""But the Obamacare defunding might just be a sideshow for Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor who have their eye on another prize: maintaining the sequester level of federal spending for everything but defense. Cantor told his caucus that this would be their victory forcing the president to sign a continuing resolution that ""wipes away all the increases he and congressional Democrats made while they were in charge and returns us to a pre-2008 level of discretionary spending.” Salon's Brian Beutler outlines this part of the plan Boehner and Cantor might decide to take.The new fiscal year starts on October 1. To adhere to the debt limit deal Congress would pass a CR appropriating $1.058 trillion — $552 billion for defense $506 billion for non defense. Then sequestration would automatically reduce that to an annualized rate of $967 billion. The advantage off writing the CR this way is that if at any point Congress manages to agree on a plan to replace sequestration discretionary spending will automatically increase to the levels agreed up on in 2011. But GOP leaders keep hinting at writing the CR to reflect a maximum appropriation of $988 billion — the same amount the government is spending under sequestration right now.The sequestration measure would then kick in to make the actual spending level $967 billion for the next year. The $21 billion difference between the appropriated $988 billion and the $967 billion limit would be plowed into defense spending while cash-starved domestic programs would continue to have to function on their sequester-reduced budgets. Cute trick for Boehner if he can pull it off. But Democrats are full aware of his plans and are demanding a truly ""clean"" continuing resolution with ""no funny business"" according to an aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.If this is the path Boehner decides on he also has to get it past his own Republicans because he won't have any Democratic support. Given how devoted the extremists in his caucus are to really truly defunding Obamacare (or at least trying to) he might not get that far and he might have to shoulder responsibility for a shutdown fight anyway.",0
739,"By Kay Henderson DES MOINES Iowa (Reuters) - Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin who rallied members of the Tea Party in their failed effort to defund Obamacare lashed out on Saturday against members of the Republican Party who agreed to end the government shutdown. The 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee's comments during a speech in Des Moines come at a time of division within the party over the strategy conservative members of Congress adopted in forcing a 16-day shutdown of the federal government last month. Polls have shown voters blamed Republicans for the shutdown. Palin who was speaking to hundreds of attendees at the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition's annual fall banquet was joined by Senator Mike Lee a Republican from Utah. Lee along with fellow Tea Party movement star Senator Ted Cruz was instrumental in the ill-fated attempt to defund Obamacare the popular name for the healthcare reform law championed by President Barack Obama. Palin told the Christian conservatives in attendance it was time to ""stiffen our spines"" for the 2014 elections. ""I want to encourage you to make your voice heard to hold politicians accountable"" Palin said. The bulk of Palin's speech was focused on the nation's current political climate. She drew thunderous applause with her sharp attack on Republicans in Congress who voted in October to raise the nation's debt ceiling and reopen the government. ""They promised that they would do everything in their power to fight against socialized medicine against Obamacare but when it came time to stand and defund it they waved the white flag of surrender and they threw under the bus the good guys who did stand up and fight for us"" Palin said. Palin named Lee and Cruz as leaders in that fight. Last month Cruz also made a stop in Iowa a key state in presidential campaigns because the Iowa caucuses are the first electoral event in the nominating process. In 2010 Lee defeated three-term Republican Senator Bob Bennett in a primary on his way to winning the Senate seat. In his speech on Saturday he called on Republicans to offer up ""market-based alternatives"" that could replace Obamacare if the Republicans hope to have success at the polls in 2014. ""Frustration is not a platform. Anger is not an agenda and outrage as a habit is not even conservative"" Lee said. (Editing by Alex Dobuzinskis)",0

741,"8 years ago(CNN) - While some Republican senators are calling for Congress to defund Obamacare altogether Sen. Susan Collins of Maine used the GOP weekly address Saturday to call for an adjustment in the health care law not a rejection of the law in its entirety.Collins takes issue with the Affordable Care Act's characterization of a full-time employee as someone who works 30 hours a week.The president's health care reform which was passed by Congress in 2010 and upheld by the Supreme Court last year will require businesses that employ at least 50 full-time workers to provide health insurance or face a penalty starting in 2015. The provision was originally supposed to kick in next year but the administration delayed it to give employers more time to prepare for the change.Collins said the 30-hour mark for ""full-time"" employees will ""only cause some businesses to reluctantly reduce the hours of their workers to fewer than 30 hours per week.""She gave an example of a school system in Maine that is already ""preparing to track and cap the number of hours that substitute teachers can work to ensure that they don't work more than 29 hours a week.""""Fewer hours means less money in the teachers' paychecks and more disruption for their students"" she added.She introduced a bill ""Forty Hours is Full Time Act"" in April that seeks to modify the federal definition of a full-time employee.""Of course fixing this one flaw won't solve the countless problems caused by Obamacare. But it would help ensure that millions of American workers do not have their hours and their paychecks reduced"" she said.White House Press Secretary Jay Carney argued in a press briefing last month that there is no data to indicate businesses are not hiring full-time employees because of the 30-hour mark.""I would say broadly that if you look at the economic data the suggestion that the ACA is reducing full-time employment is belied by the facts"" he said.Read a transcript of the senator’s full remarks below:",1
742,"Krugman reminds us of the three simple ideas upon which the Affordable Care Act is based:1. All Americans even those with pre-existing conditions should have access to affordable health insurance2. All Americans even those currently healthy should be required (or induced) to buy insurance to spread the risks as broadly as possible to keep the costs reasonable3. There should be subsidiess to prevent the ""mandate"" from becoming too onerous so that the cost of premiums as a share of income can be held down.As to whether this approach can work despite the Republican predictions that it will fail we of course have the example of Romneycare in Massachusetts (based I remind people largely on a proposal from the Right-leaning Heritage Foundation). Krugman then explores whether larger starters with significant numbers of uninsured can duplicate what happened in the Bay State.The answer to this question depends in the first place on whether insurance companies are willing to offer coverage at reasonable rates. And the answer so far is a clear “yes.” In California insurers came in with bids running significantly below expectations; in New York it appears that premiums will be cut roughly in half.apologies but the latter link counts against your monthly quota from the NYTimes so you might not be able to see it.Krugman offers two paragraphs that frame the issue succinctly. In the first he writesOver all then health reform will help millions of Americans who were previously either too sick or too poor to get the coverage they needed and also offer a great deal of reassurance to millions more who currently have insurance but fear losing it; it will provide these benefits at the expense of a much smaller number of other Americans mostly the very well off. It is if you like a plan to comfort the afflicted while (slightly) afflicting the comfortable.So far the American people do not yet fully grasp that the vast majority of them will be better off with respect to medical insurance without being hit directly financially by the cost of premiums. A small number of better off Americans will wind up paying somewhat more. If the American people understand this attempting to sabotage Obamacare will have serious political implications for Republicans.There is also another problem for the GOP:And the prospect that such a plan might succeed is anathema to a party whose whole philosophy is built around doing just the opposite of taking from the “takers” and giving to the “job creators” known to the rest of us as the “rich.” Hence the brinkmanship.Krugman is very blunt about that philosophy but then we can remember a certain presidential candidate who complained about he 47% who are takers.brinkmanship - the willingness of the Republicans particularly among their tea party caucus members in the House to risk shutting down the government and crashing the economy in order to prevent the success of Obamacarewhen their own leaders have admitted that confrontations over the budget inflict substantial harm on the economy.It will not be because of fear of what is now a rapidly falling budget deficit.Nor Krugman opines will it be because they true believe that the slashing of federal spending will actually lead to increased prosperity.No Republicans may be willing to risk economic and financial crisis solely in order to deny essential health care and financial security to millions of their fellow Americans. Let’s hear it for their noble cause!Let me if I may explain just a bit what that noble cause is paraphrasing well-known words of the first (and greatest) Republican President:Government of the wealthy by the Republicans for the corporationsAnything that might threaten that paradigm is to be fought fiercely- that includes suppressing the votes of those who might vote for a different paradigm- that means fomenting fear and hatred on issues like guns in order to gin up an angry mob to vote against their own economic interests- that includes gerrymandering to minimize the impact of votes of the masses of people who either do not agree with their paradigm or who may not be able to be misled by the promotion of fear and hatredIt is the mentality of the American Colonel who said in Vietnam that in order to save the village we had to destroy it.It is the petulance of the child who if he can't have his way wants to take the ball and go home even if someone else brought the ball.If you wonder why the House Republicans have now voted almost 40 times to try to kill Obamacare it is because if it succeeds not only will they not be able to roll it back but it also undercuts any arguments about the other social programs that for half a century or more they have tried to kill - Medicare Medicaid and most of all Social Security.Panic is the right words to describe Republican actions towards Obamacare.Petulance is another appropriate description.Which is why the White House and the Democrats have to hold firm- for the health (physical and economic) of the American people- for the future (economic and political) of the United States.",0
743,"Be careful you don't fall off the Obamacare ""cliff"" when the boss asks you to put in some overtime.Working more could ultimately mean thousands of dollars less for you under a quirk in the new health-care law going into effect this fall. This could prompt some people to cut back on their hours to avoid losing money.""Working more can actually leave you worse off"" the price-comparison site ValuePenguin.com notes in a new analysis.""It's sort of an absurd scenario"" said Jonathan Wu ValuePenguin.com's co-founder. ""It's something for people to be aware of.""In that scenario an individual or family whose annual income surpasses maximums set by the federal government—if only by $1—will totally lose subsidies available to buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.(Read more: Obamacare fraud?)The loss of those subsidies in some cases will mean that people potentially would have been better off financially if they had worked less during the year Wu said. And they then would have to work significantly more to make up for the lost subsidy.""I think they'd be surprised to see how drastic it is"" said Wu. ""I'd be kind of shocked to see if I make $100 less (in total income each year) I get all these benefits but if I make $100 more I get nothing.""""You basically don't want to fall in that hole"" said Wu adding that he believed contractors and others with more control over their incomes would be apt to adjust their hours worked to avoid the subsidy cliff.He also said that because of lower insurance premiums often offered to younger people the effect will more likely be seen by older people. But ""you will see it across all age groups"" in the seven states including New York and Vermont where insurance premiums are either barred from being affected by age or restricted from being dramatically affected he said.Under the ACA federal subsidies in the form of tax credits to buy insurance on new state health insurance exchanges will be available to millions of people who can start enrolling on those exchanges Oct. 1. The subsidies are available to people or families whose incomes total 400 percent above the federal poverty level or less and are designed to cap their insurance premiums at 9.5 percent of their total income.For a single person that FPL income maximum is $45960 per year. The maximums are adjusted upward for couples and families until maxing out at $94200 for a family of four.(Read more: Doctors skeptical confused about Obamacare)Under a scenario that ValuePenguin.com identified a couple in Ohio both age 50 would be eligible for subsidies worth $3452 to purchase a so-called silver insurance plan—a moderately priced level of benefits under the ACA's scheme—that costs $9346 annually if they made up to $62040 per year.But if they made just $1 more than that they would lose the subsidy. Wu noted that the couple then would have to earn at least $65492 to make up for the lost subsidy.In New York a family of three whose annual income totals $78120 would pay $12784 for the second-lower-priced silver plan on that state's insurance exchange. After getting a $5363 tax credit the family's net cost for the insurance would be $7421.But if the family earned even slightly more than $78120 they would have to pay the entire $12784 for the insurance because they then wouldn't qualify for the subsidy.To make up for that the family's annual income would have to reach $83483 Wu said.The stark effect of peoples' age in determining their risk from the subsidy cliff is seen in two examples from Connecticut.(Read more: This could put Obamacare in the ER)There Wu said a 27-year-old single man would pay $3636 annually for the second-cheapest silver plan—less than the $4366 cap on insurance premiums for individuals earning $45960 or less annually. That person would not be eligible for subsidies and thus would see no disincentive in working more hours.But the annual premiums for a 50-year-old Connecticut couple buying that plan would be $12468. If their combined incomes were $62040 or less they would receive $6575 in subsidies to offset the cost.However if their income was more than that they would lose the subsidies leaving them out of pocket $6575. They then would have to earn at least $68615 to make up for that lost subsidy Wu said.",1

745,It is stunning that President Obama himself said “this growing inequality is not just morally wrong” but “bad economics” as if he had nothing to do with it. In his recent “economic pivot” which started with his speech at Knox College in Illinois on July 24 no one has mentioned that since Obama took office in 2009 he has created an economy of renters and part-time jobs while the number of billionaires in the United States has increased by more than 23 percent. The hypocrisy is remarkable. How can the president get away with railing against an economy of his own making?Obama’s ability to remain so oblivious to reality is also convenient when one looks at how Obamacare’s implementation is unfolding. In an underreported jaw-dropping exposure Joel Gehrke of the Washington Examiner details how the National Treasury Employees Union — that’s right the union that represents the IRS — is “urging members to write their congressional representatives in opposition to receiving coverage” through Obamacare. In other words Obama’s tool of choice for enforcing Obamacare and imposing it on the rest of us the IRS wants no part of Obamacare for themselves.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe union’s campaign follows House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp’s introduction of a bill that would remove lawmakers and federal employees from the current federal health benefits program and move them into the Obamacare insurance exchanges. Congressman Camp offered this bill according to his spokeswoman because “If the Obamacare exchanges are good enough for hardworking Americans and small businesses . . . they should be good enough for . . . federal employees.” Hopefully Republican members of Congress can seize on this idea and go agency by agency legislating that all federal employees be subject to the Obamacare exchanges. Would President Obama veto that bill? Would Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid even let it come to the floor for a vote? Anyway shout out to Congressman Camp.Similarly the president’s hypocrisy extends to the administration’s efforts to sell Obamacare. The National Review’s Eliana Johnson reports that Obamacare call centers in California are not offering health insurance benefits to their employees. And not only are the very people who are supposed to be selling Americans on the benefits of Obamacare not going to get those benefits themselves but at least half of the call-center jobs are only part-time jobs not full-time positions as originally advertised. Again the glaring hypocrisy shines through.,1

747,WASHINGTON — President Obama offered a vigorous lengthy defense of his healthcare law Friday dismissing Republican attempts to block it as an “ideological fixation.”In a preview of the message Democrats will carry into the 2014 midterm elections the president acknowledged that the Affordable Care Act may have flaws that will need to be fixed but emphasized that it has already brought substantial benefits to Americans with insurance and will soon help the 30 million who are without it.He asserted that the GOP wanted only to scrap the law not find a solution for the uninsured. “There’s not even a pretense now that they’re going to replace it with something better” he said.But Obama also said he did not believe Republicans would shut down the federal government in a standoff over the heathcare law even though many have threatened to do just that. The federal budget expires on Sept. 30 and Obama and Congress will have to reach agreement by then to keep the government running.Advertisement“I can tell you that the American people would have difficulty understanding why we would weaken our economy shut down our government shut down vital services … because Republicans have determined that they don’t want to see these folks get healthcare” he said. “I have confidence that common sense in the end will prevail.”Obama also called on House Republicans to pass immigration reform saying the bipartisan Senate bill would pass if it were brought to the floor. “The problem is internal Republican caucus politics” he said.He said Republicans should embrace reform because reports have shown that it would bolster the economy bringing new buyers to the housing market and new foreign workers for high-tech firms. He also noted that it would secure the border with “unprecedented resources.”“I think that the speaker [of the House] and others have said they need to do something. And I’d urge when they get back [to the Capitol] to do something. Put forward a bill that has an opportunity to actually pass” he said. “It may not be precisely what’s in the Senate bill. My preference would be for them to go ahead and call the Senate bill but if they’ve got some additional ideas I think the Senate’s happy to consider them.”AdvertisementThe president’s defense of his top domestic priorities came in an hourlong White House news conference a day before he was scheduled to head to Martha’s Vineyard for a vacation.Obama also defended his unilateral decision to delay a requirement that large employers provide insurance or pay a fine a key part of the Affordable Care Act. He characterized it as “a technical change” that he should have been able to work out with Congress.“In a normal political environment it would have been easier for me to simply call up the speaker and say ‘You know what? This is a tweak that doesn’t go to the essence of the law’” Obama said.That remark irritated Republicans.Advertisement“We were all scratching our heads when he claimed that he couldn’t get Congress to help him delay the mandate because Republicans in Congress tried to delay the mandates only to have the president issue a veto threat” said Don Stewart a spokesman for Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.Republicans want to overturn Obama’s healthcare law said Brendan Buck a spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) “because it is driving up costs decreasing access and destroying American jobs.”“We should enact a step-by-step common-sense approach that starts with lowering costs” Buck said.Obama suggested that there would be other problems with the healthcare law besides his decision to delay the employer mandate but he said that none would be reason to abandon his top domestic achievement.Advertisement“There is no doubt that in implementing the Affordable Care Act — a program of this significance — there are going to be some glitches. No doubt about it. There are going to be things where we say ‘You know what? We should have thought of that earlier or this would work a little bit better or this needs an adjustment’” the president said. He said the same was true for Social Security Medicare new cars and Apple iPads.“Our goal is to actually deliver high-quality affordable healthcare for people and to reform the system so costs start going down and people start getting a better bang for the buck” he said. “And I make no apologies for that.”christi.parsons@latimes.comAdvertisementFollow Politics Now on Twitter and Facebookchristi.parsons@latimes.comTwitter: @cparsons,0
748,Before the dust settled on the news that the Obama Administration was delaying the intrusive employer mandate until 2015 a new 606-page regulation was issued on Friday by the Department of Health and Human Services stating it would now rely on self-reported income and employment verification in the state-run exchanges under ObamaCare. In other words a welcome mat for fraud.This is another startling development which is becoming part of a larger theme as ObamaCare is rolled out to the public. It is clear that the Affordable Care Act is unworkable. For those like myself who opposed it from the start we saw the writing on the wall early on as President Obama’s signature health care legislation was rammed through the halls of Congress. If only then-Speaker Pelosi had insisted that her party read the legislation before passing it maybe some of this would have come to light earlier on. While the eventual passage of the legislation was certain under Democrat control of Congress maybe some Democrats now sounding the alarm about the devastating impact of the legislation would have done so sooner if they had read it while it was still a bill not only after it became law.As of now ObamaCare is $1 trillion over budget; I say “as of now” because it’s almost certain that with the elimination of the anti-fraud measures the cost will further skyrocket and there are examples to back up this theory.In January the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services began an effort to remove ineligible people from the state’s Medicaid rolls. The initial audit concluded that of the first 20500 recipients screened it was recommended 13709 be removed from eligibility. The Chicago Tribune reports that “since 2000 Illinois Medicaid rolls have doubled from fewer than 1.4 million people to nearly 2.8 million or more than 1 in 5 Illinoisans.” In part because of the rising Medicaid rolls the state’s backlog of unpaid bills is expected to grow to $21 billion by fiscal year 2018.States are fascinating laboratories of democracy that can provide brilliant blueprints for other states and the federal government to follow. However states can also serve as flashing red lights when plans go wrong. Illinois is a great example of how a lack of anti-fraud measures can drain a state’s coffers. As President Obama’s home state he would be wise to take notice.President Reagan famously said “trust but verify.” In light of the notion that the U.S. health care system makes up one-eighth of the economy it’s my hope that this administration will grasp hold of this sensible advice.,1

753,WASHINGTON — Sixteen Senate Democrats met with President Obama on Wednesday to urge that he right his foundering healthcare website warning of a “crisis of confidence” if he doesn’t act quickly.The president’s team acknowledged struggling with how to present its message to the public but some senators left the meeting more concerned that there were no immediate fixes forthcoming more than a month after healthcare.gov went live.With reelection battles looming fellow Democrats have been left to explain the website failures while hoping that the benefits of the Affordable Care Act are just around the corner.The frustration was on full display Wednesday as 15 Senate Democrats up for reelection and the senator in charge of their coordinated campaigns urged Obama to get the troubled launch behind him and his party.Advertisement“It’s absolutely unacceptable in this day and age that the administration can’t deliver on the promises it made to all Americans because of technical problems with a website” said Sen. Mark Begich (D-Alaska). “Alaskans should be appreciating the critical benefits of the Affordable Care Act but there is an understandable crisis in confidence because the administration has yet to get it off the ground.”PHOTOS: The battle over ObamacareOne Senate aide who asked for anonymity to discuss the private conversation said it was clear the White House knows it has a “messaging problem” but not that it has “any immediate fixes to it which was disconcerting.”Obama advisors are fighting a crisis of faith among Democrats as they try to muscle the marketplaces through the rough patch and into widespread use. Already 11 Senate Democrats have signaled their support for extending the enrollment deadline a delay that administration officials fear could lead to an unraveling of the larger policy.AdvertisementWhite House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough has personally led efforts to reassure balky Democrats traveling to Capitol Hill and routinely talking with those up for reelection in 2014.But nervousness remains.“I am very frustrated with the rollout of the exchanges. The dysfunction and delays are unacceptable” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said after the meeting. “I remain deeply convinced that this is a ‘show me’ moment. This will not be resolved until Americans can day after day sign onto the health marketplace review their options and complete their applications.”Another Senate Democratic aide who also was not authorized to comment publicly about the private conversation described the meeting as “civil.”Advertisement“The White House understands the situation folks going into reelection are in” the aide said. “It’s still a concern.”The chaos surrounding the rocky startup has given ammunition to critics and forced Obama to answer tough questions about his plan instead of touring the country drawing crowds for healthcare recruiters. Among the questions is whether he described the program accurately over the last three years when he said people could keep their old plans if they desired. But plans that don’t meet the new Obamacare standards are grandfathered in only if they were purchased before the law was signed in 2010.House Republicans stoked concerns about the grandfather clause Wednesday by announcing the House would vote next week on the “Keep Your Health Plan Act” which would allow insurance plans being offered today to continue into next year.The bill’s author Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.) calls it a “voluntary escape hatch” for people who want to keep their old coverage.AdvertisementPHOTOS: 2013’s memorable political momentsAfter the White House meeting Obama traveled to Dallas for a Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee fundraiser and to promote healthcare enrollment. Texas is one of 36 states dependent on the federal website because it has declined to create its own exchange.Speaking to a crowd at Temple Emanu-El in Dallas Obama thanked a group of volunteers for promoting Obamacare even though state Republican leaders aren’t doing much to help implement the law.Texas GOP Gov. Rick Perry has refused federal money to expand Medicaid to cover more low-income families. And the state is considering new requirements for recruiters hired under federal grants to help people sign up for Obamacare. A quarter of the state’s population is uninsured the biggest share in the country. That amounts to about 6 million Texans.Advertisement“This task is especially challenging in the great Lone Star State” Obama told the crowd. “There’s no state that actually needs this more than Texas.”In a statement Perry accused the president of coming to Texas “in a desperate attempt to salvage his ill-conceived and unpopular program from a Titanic fate by preaching expansion of the same Medicaid system he himself admits is broken.”Earlier in the day Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius testified before the Senate Finance Committee where even Democratic champions of the healthcare law were upset by the administration’s past failure to keep them informed of potential problems.“You’ve got to tell us what’s going on candidly fully” said Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) chairman of the committee and a chief architect of the law. “The more you don’t tell us the greater the problem is going to be.”Advertisementchristi.parsons@latimes.comTwitter: @cparsonslisa.mascaro@latimes.comTwitter: @lisamascaroinDCAdvertisementmichael.memoli@latimes.comTwitter: @mikememoli,0
754,"Right Wing Republicans have so maligned the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) that they actually began to believe their own lying and misinforming rhetoric. Fortunately all the data suggest that Obamacare is actually working. Americans will now have brochures with actual plans and options to choose from. They can now compare reality with the lies they heard.Anyone wondering why Right Wing Republicans are in overdrive to shut the government down lest Obamacare is defunded realizes the eyes of many Americans are about to be opened. The millions that will see not a giveaway but help in getting access to affordable health insurance screenings and health care for the first time in years are also voters. They are voters that will wonder how a politician could be so convincingly evil to have wanted them denied something many needed for their health care or financial survival.Kentucky Republican Senator Mitch McConnell is adamant that Obamacare be defunded. But Kentucky citizens are yearning for health insurance.The crush of people don't greet Diaz-Dempsey with tea party dogma or amateur constitutional scholarship. No one is there to complain about the individual mandate or heckle about death panels. They have questions. They wonder if they could get coverage despite having a pre-existing medical condition how much it will cost them. They ask if Indiana has a similar program or if this was only for Kentucky. Could they just enroll their child? They talk about their sons and daughters neighbors going without health care and ask about the subsidies. The vast majority are relieved to learn about the health exchange. Linda Parrish 47 showed up at the table and gushed to Diaz-Dempsey: ""This is what I've been waiting on."" Parrish has health insurance but her best friend doesn't.It is not all roses in Kentucky. The tea party has been calling people telling them not to sign up because they falsely claim there are no real health insurance exchanges. Many low income workers are against it because they were lied to about what the costs would be.Christopher McClure hobbles through the doors his inner thigh hurting from what he suspects are a pair of spider bites. He is not employed and does not have health insurance. His wife Michelle 29 works as an assistant manager at a pizza chain making $12000 a year. She also has no insurance and would qualify for the Medicaid expansion. But she's against Obamacare convinced that it will wipe out her meager earnings. “Next enrollment season"" she says ""they’re going to sock it to me.”The McClures under Obamacare would be fully subsidized. They are so misinformed that they have no clue that Obamacare is that one leg on the stool that removes a financial burden that is materially affecting their access to real financial independence. It makes sense to remove the health care anchor from people’s neck giving them the wherewithal to go seek a job or make their own job.The reelection of President Obama which makes it impossible to kill Obamacare before implementation is the best thing that has happened to the uninsured the poor and the working middle class.

755,The president defended his health care law at the White House Thursday the day after House Republicans voted again to repeal it. (The Washington Post)The president defended his health care law at the White House Thursday the day after House Republicans voted again to repeal it. (The Washington Post)Transforming the nation’s health-care system stands as Barack Obama’s most crucial piece of unfinished business with much of his presidential legacy riding on whether it is deemed to have succeeded or failed.While other presidents have managed to overcome intense opposition to major new social initiatives Obama faces a degree of difficulty with health care that has no historic parallel.So there was a certain urgency in the speech that Obama gave Thursday the morning after the Republican-led House voted for the 38th and 39th times to dismantle all or part of the Affordable Care Act.“There are still a lot of folks — in this town at least — who are rooting for this law to fail. Some of them seem to think this law is about me. It’s not” he said.The process of implementing the law promises to be “many orders of magnitude more complicated” than establishing such programs as Social Security and Medicare said David Blumenthal president of the Commonwealth Fund an organization that produces research on health and public policy issues.Blumenthal the Obama administration’s former coordinator of health information technology also wrote a book on how 20th century presidents dealt with health-care policy.He noted that both Social Security and Medicare are national programs that basically consist of paying bills and making payments to those who are eligible.The new health-care law seeks to establish new health-insurance marketplaces and transform how care is delivered while giving states more leeway in determining how that will be done.Obama must also implement the new law against a united opposition party that is determined to throw as many obstacles as it can in his path.“Obamacare is a disaster” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said in a speech on the Senate floor shortly after the president’s remarks. “Mr. President the plan is already failing.”Some Republican lawmakers who routinely help their constituents with concerns about Social Security and Medicare have even served notice that they do not plan to assist those who come to them for aid in navigating the new health-care system.“All we can do is pass them back to the Obama administration. The ball’s in their court. They’re responsible for it” Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) told the Hill newspaper last month.The question of who is to blame for the fact that the bill passed without a single Republican vote is likely to remain a matter of dispute between the parties for years to come.If the president ever had any real hope that Republicans would embrace the new law after the Supreme Court upheld its constitutionality and he won reelection he has since given that up.But current and former administration officials say Obama and his team have been surprised at how steadfast the opposition has remained.“It used to be that you had a fight and it was over and you moved on” said Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Jonathan Gruber who consulted with the administration and congressional Democrats in putting together the law.The drumbeat of House votes against the law is little more than political theater but the decision by nearly half the nation’s states to reject federal money to expand their Medicaid programs — a crucial element of achieving near-universal health coverage — has the potential to be far more damaging.In some states nearly everyone will have some kind of health coverage under the new law.In others a perverse result is likely: Many people who earn up to the poverty level will remain uninsured while those who make more will receive government subsidies to purchase policies in the newly established marketplaces known as exchanges.Administration officials say that as the benefits of the new law become more apparent opposing it will become more difficult for Republicans.They note that the Democrats went through much the same evolution before and after the establishment of the Medicare prescription drug program in 2003 under President George W. Bush.After initially denouncing the drug program and vowing to repeal it Democratic lawmakers ultimately embraced it and even devoted town hall meetings to helping constituents sign up for it.“We know the American people think the bill should be implemented and if there are problems along the way we need to address them” said White House communications director Jennifer Palmieri. “Our goal is to implement it well. We do think the further along we get as people get more and more benefits the less attractive it should be for people to fight it.”But some of those who support the new system say that will not happen without a big push from the president himself. Thursday’s event at the White House for instance highlighted an often-overlooked aspect of the law that has already taken effect: its requirement that insurance companies spend 80 percent of the premiums they receive on providing health care rather than taking the payments as profit or using them to pay for overhead.”If he had one shortcoming during the passage of the law it was failing to be out there personally as much as he should have been” Blumenthal said. “His legacy is on the line and there is probably no point in holding any of his political capital back. He is all-in for making this work.”,1
756,The Affordable Care Act the most sweeping health care program created in a half century is expected to extend coverage to 25 million Americans over the next decade according to the most recent government estimates. But that will still leave a projected 31 million people without insurance by 2023. Those left out include undocumented workers and poor people living in the 21 states such as Virginia that have so far declined to expand Medicaid under the statute commonly called Obamacare.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“The law will cut the number of the uninsured in half” said Matthew Buettgens of the Urban Institute. “This is an important development but it certainly isn’t the definition of universal.”As a result while hospitals and other providers gear up to handle an influx of Americans who will be newly insured as of Jan. 1 many of the nation’s 1000 free clinics which cater to the uninsured and are financed mostly by private donations are redoubling efforts to help those bypassed by the law. The trend shows both the limits of the law and the way it is affecting nearly every corner of the health-care system sometimes in little-noticed ways.Some of the free clinics are planning to step up their focus on undocumented workers who won’t be permitted to buy insurance on the new online marketplaces and are expected to become a larger share of the uninsured. Other clinics seeking to fill what they see as a major gap in the law are considering offering free dental care.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAndre Sokol a 59-year-old unemployed carpenter is an example of someone who won’t be helped by the law and will continue to rely on the Arlington clinic which at an given time provides care to about 1600 people. He lost his health-care benefits when he left his job in the construction industry several years ago to care for his longtime girlfriend who was diagnosed with ALS and his mother who was battling dementia. Two years ago the women died within two months of each other. Sokol had no job no income and no place to live.In January Sokol had quadruple bypass surgery at Virginia Hospital Center which absorbed the costs. He didn’t qualify for Medicaid because Virginia doesn’t allow single men no matter how poor on Medicaid unless they’re disabled. The state has one of the strictest eligibility standards in the country. That would change if the state expanded its program under the health law.At the same time Sokol’s income is too low to allow him to get federal subsidies to help pay for a private policy on the exchange. (The law assumed people with incomes below 100 percent of the poverty level or about $11500 would be covered by Medicaid but many states balked at enlarging their programs after the Supreme Court said the expansions were optional.) Arlington Free Clinic officials said about half of their patients are in the same situation: They are below the poverty line but aren’t eligible either for Medicaid or subsidies to buy insurance.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementAfter Sokol had surgery the Arlington clinic agreed to take him on as a patient as part of an agreement with Virginia Hospital Center. That agreement is one way people can become patients at the clinic; other patients come in by way of the lottery or via referrals from homeless and domestic-abuse shelters.“Most of our members would love to go out of business and close their doors if there was a program that ended uninsurance” Nicole Lamoureux Busby executive director of the National Association of Free and Charitable Clinics said. “But this isn’t universal health care. We’re not planning to see a dramatic decrease in our patients.”Busby said that many of the clinics she works with are facing an additional hurdle with the health law: Convincing private donors that they will still play a crucial role after millions gain coverage.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“So many listen to the news and hear a 24-second sound bite that says everyone is getting coverage” she said. “The donors may think we don’t need their funds.”An analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation predicted that the uninsured rate in Arlington County would fall from 12.4 to 7.4 percent after the health law is fully implemented in 2022. The foundation estimated that 14000 people would remain without insurance down from the 24000 people currently lacking coverage.The Arlington Free Clinic which was founded in 1994 is staffed by doctors who volunteer their time when they aren’t at their regular jobs. To be eligible for the clinic individuals must be over 18 live in Arlington County and earn less than 200 percent of the poverty line or about $23000 for an individual. They must also have been in the United States for at least a year.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementOn a recent Tuesday the line for the lottery went around the block. It included a wide range of patients including young children and the middle-aged who spoke English Spanish Arabic and Mandarin and other languages.“I need a doctor for a lot of things” said Ebtsam Ibrahim a 46-year-old Egyptian woman and mother of four.

758,"As of now Americans are required to obtain health insurance by March 31 or will face a penalty under the individual mandate. Some have suggested the penalty could be delayed given the problems with the Web site might prevent people who otherwise want insurance from obtaining it.The White House on Wednesday announced it would give Americans six weeks longer than previously thought -- until March 31 -- to enroll before facing a penalty but also said the change had nothing to do with the Web site problems.""Extending this period will give consumers critical time in which to become familiar with the website and choose a plan that is best for them"" the letter states. ""Individuals should not be penalized for lack of coverage if they are unable to purchase health insurance due to technical problems.""The letter doesn’t state how long the senators would like to extend open enrollment only that it should be beyond March 31. One of the signers Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.) called for a two-month delay in remarks on Thursday. Separately another Democratic senator Joe Manchin (W.Va.) has called for a one-year delay in the individual mandate.The signatories to the letter are Shaheen and Sens. Mark Begich (D-Alaska) Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) Mary Landrieu (D-La.) Hagan (D-N.C.) Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) Mark Udall (D-Colo.) Tom Udall (D-N.M.) Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) and Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.).Begich Pryor Landrieu and Hagan are all top GOP targets in red states in 2014 and Bennet is likely to be targeted in 2016. (Shaheen and Mark Udall face reelection in swing states in 2014 but aren't considered among Republicans' top targets.)Feinstein stands out as a long-time liberal senator from California. Tom Udall is considered largely safe for reelection in New Mexico next year and Heinrich was just elected in 2012 in the same state.Here's the text of Shaheen's letter:Dear Secretary Sebelius:When fully implemented the Affordable Care Act represents a bold step forward in reforming our nation’s health care system. It has the potential to improve the quality of care we all receive and provides the opportunity for millions of Americans to purchase quality affordable health insurance.The newly created federal and state health insurance marketplaces are intended to allow consumers the opportunity to compare health insurance options and find a plan that fits their needs and their budgets. For three years we have been eagerly waiting for the launch of these marketplaces. However now that the marketplaces are open we have become discouraged and frustrated with the problems and interactions that are occurring with the Affordable Care Act’s federally-administered website healthcare.gov.As long as these substantial technology glitches persist we are losing valuable time to educate and enroll people in insurance plans. Our constituents are frustrated and we fear that the longer the website is not functional opportunities for people to log on learn about their insurance choices and enroll will be lost.Given the existing problems with healthcare.gov and other state-run marketplace websites that depend on the federally-administered website we urge you to consider extending open enrollment beyond the current end date of March 31 2014. Extending this period will give consumers critical time in which to become familiar with the website and choose a plan that is best for them. Individuals should not be penalized for lack of coverage if they are unable to purchase health insurance due to technical problems.The Affordable Care Act has already had a significant impact on the lives of millions of Americans; seniors are now paying less for their prescription drugs critical preventive care services are available for free and important work is being done to improve the quality of care we receive. Americans will now have the opportunity to receive tax credits to purchase quality health insurance and starting in January 2014 insurance companies will no longer be able to deny health coverage because of a pre-existing condition or drop coverage if someone is sick.We appreciate your efforts to fully implement this law and look forward to working with you to accomplish that goal. Thank you for considering our requests to extend the open enrollment period if the healthcare.gov substantial technology glitches continue.",0
759,Margaret Davis of West L.A. voted for President Obama and appreciates the ideas behind the Affordable Care Act. She agrees that everyone should have access to healthcare and no one should be denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions.But here’s the problem:She knows firsthand as the new law of the land rolls clumsily into being that it’s not working out to everyone’s advantage.“I’m a 55-year-old woman in excellent health and have a catastrophic health plan” she wrote recently to Obama and California Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer. “I am completely happy with my plan. I received notice that the plan is being canceled and that to stay with a “comparable” plan my premiums would increase 88% or $200 extra per month. To add insult to injury the plan is INFERIOR to my existing plan.”AdvertisementIf you guessed that she got no response from any of those elected officials you win a box of cough drops.But public officials didn’t throw a complete shutout at Davis. She wrote to U.S. Rep. Karen Bass (D-Los Angeles) when she didn’t hear from the others and one of Bass’ staffers called Davis to say she’ll be looking into the specifics of her case.“Any time you do a huge policy change like healthcare there’s going to be all sorts of problems and glitches that need to be worked out” Bass told me Tuesday from Washington where she said there were new calls for allowing people to keep the policies they have as President Obama had repeatedly promised they’d be able to do.President Clinton has urged such a move and Feinstein’s office backed the idea Tuesday. She noted in a statement that her office had received 30832 contacts from Californians “many of whom are very distressed by cancellations of their insurance policies and who are facing increased out-of-pocket expenses.”Advertisement“The Affordable Care Act is a good law but it’s not perfect” the Feinstein statement said.No not by a longshot beginning with the federal website debacle and highlighted by Obama’s now-laughable promises of a smooth transition. But Bass worries that the problems will further embolden critics who were determined from the beginning to do a grave dance on healthcare reform.Hundreds of people attended a town hall conference hosted by Bass on Sunday in West L.A. She said some attendees were in the same situation as Davis and not very happy about it; others were confused by their options. Bass said many were assisted as they enrolled in new plans through the state exchange Covered California.“But overall people were like Margaret” said Bass who called Davis on Tuesday to discuss her case. “They really want this to work and they’re just trying to figure it out.”AdvertisementWhich hasn’t been all that easy for Davis an accountant and software consultant who couldn’t believe “how botched up” the healthcare.gov website was among other problems.And would anyone be shocked if insurance companies were trying to take advantage of all the confusion?Davis lives with her husband and two teenage sons but chose not to be covered by her husband’s healthcare plan which would have added $600 per month to the cost. All she wanted from her own plan was the peace of mind that came with knowing she wouldn’t go broke if she were seriously ill or injured.She paid Kaiser $224 a month with a $5000 deductible.AdvertisementUnder the new Kaiser plan her premium would rise to $420.46 a month. The plan carries a lower deductible of $4500 after which she would then pay 40% of the cost of care up to a cap of $6350.Though Davis appreciates the goal that all policies must meet minimal standards of coverage she doesn’t anticipate needing either the maternity or mental health care that would be part of her new plan.“I had a feeling my cost would go up” said Davis who makes just enough money to be ineligible for a government subsidy “but I was floored when I saw that it was an 87.7% increase.”Davis checked the federal and state websites for a better option but couldn’t find one so she called an insurance broker.AdvertisementSteve Jakowchik found Davis a deal at Anthem Blue Cross that essentially splits the difference between her current Kaiser plan and the replacement plan. Davis told me she’s inclined to go with the Blue Cross deal unless there’s a reprieve and people are allowed to keep existing policies.Jakowchik meanwhile told me that among the roughly 100 clients he’s assisting about 30 are getting plans that are more comprehensive cheaper or both. The other clients are paying anywhere from a little bit more to a lot more for plans that are inferior to what they had better than what they had or about the same.The most striking change he’s seeing Jakowchik said is among clients who can get pretty good deals but only if they give up access to the doctors and hospitals they now use. Because his practice is on the Westside he’s hearing from clients who aren’t happy about losing Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and UCLA Medical Center as hospital options.“I just ran into one of these today” said Jakowchik who told me about a Marina del Rey family that has to decide between a big premium increase and access to Cedars or much lower premiums but a choice between hospitals in Torrance or the San Fernando Valley.AdvertisementIn six months a year or maybe longer it’s possible that the rocky transition will be behind us and the most well-intended goals of healthcare reform will be met.But as the signature initiative of the Obama presidency you’d think this would have been managed with a little more attention to detail.steve.lopez@latimes.com,1
760,On Monday former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin urged Americans to light up Capitol Hill switchboards to urge senators to live up to their campaign promises and support Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Mike Lee (R-UT) in their effort to defund Obamacare.“Remember we elected these senators precisely for moments like this. If they can’t do anything with the power we’ve given them through their elected office then perhaps it’s time for them to retire and let someone else have a go” Palin said. “Opposition to Obamacare carried us to victory in 2010. And 2014 is just around the corner.”On Saturday Palin wrote an exclusive op-ed for Breitbart News backing Lee and Cruz. In her Facebook post on Monday the day the Obamacare fight started in the Senate Palin said it was even more important for Americans living in red states–like Alaska Arkansas Louisiana and North Carolina–represented by Democrats to “politely” let their senators know there will be consequences at the ballot box if they vote procedurally to shut down debate in the Senate:Please call your senators and politely ask them to stand with Senator Cruz. This is especially important if your senator is a Democrat up for re-election in a red state in 2014. That would be Senators Mark Begich (D-AK) Mark Pryor (D-AR) Mary Landrieu (D-LA) and Kay Hagan (D-NC). Remind them politely that we are watching their votes very carefully and even a procedural vote that shuts down this debate will be regarded as a vote for Obamacare and there will be consequences for them at the ballot box next year. The same goes for Republicans up for re-election. We definitely expect them to stand shoulder to shoulder with Senator Cruz through thick and thin.The House passed a short-term resolution to fund the government except for Obamacare on Friday. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) is attempting to insert an amendment to that bill that funds Obamacare before sending the bill back to the House. On Monday Cruz asked that there be a 60-vote threshold for amendments on the House bill being taken up in the Senate.Palin reiterated “We shouldn’t preemptively surrender the fight to those who rammed through this outrageously burdensome and unaffordable ploy for government control of health care even though some are trying to convince us that the fight is futile.”“Just because a fight isn’t easy doesn’t mean it’s not worth fighting” she said.Palin then included information about where Americans could find the contact information for their senators:,1
761,"President Obama said Thursday he was “sorry” Americans are losing health insurance plans he repeatedly said they could keep and vowed to work with those who are finding themselves in a “tough situation” as a result.His remarks came as a bipartisan bill was introduced in the Senate to delay the implementation of the individual mandate of ObamaCare by one year meaning Americans would avoid a $95 penalty for not having health insurance that is scheduled to kick in next year.Referring to those who are losing their health insurance plans Obama told NBC News ""I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me. We've got to work hard to make sure that they know we hear them and we are going to do everything we can to deal with folks who find themselves in a tough position as a consequence of this.”The White House while defending the health care law and vowing to fix the problems with the website has not explicitly ruled out the possibility of delaying the individual mandate.House Speaker John Boehner responded to Obama's apology late Thursday saying ""an apology is certainly in order but what Americans want to hear is that the president is going to keep his promise.""More On This...Thursday's bill was introduced by Senators Joe Manchin D-W.Va. and Mark Kirk R-Ill. who said since the Affordable Care Act was passed there have been “many identifiable problems exposed in the law that need to be addressed.”“We need to start working together to fix this law and make it work so that all Americans have access to affordable and reliable health care coverage” Manchin said in a statement. “We can start with a one-year delay of the individual mandate to eliminate penalty fees if individuals choose to not enroll for a health care plan in 2014.""This common sense proposal simply allows Americans to take more time to browse and explore their options making 2014 a true transition year.”The legislation acknowledges there are many positive components of the Affordable Care Act that will lead to health care becoming more affordable for all Americans and these reforms must “continue to be implemented.”“Nevertheless it is important to recognize when a new program is not meeting the high standards that the American people expect” the bill reads. “So far the federal healthcare exchanges have failed and we must deliver a better product.”The bill also says that delaying the entire implementation of ObamaCare would not be “responsible” but Congress should take action to make “commonsense reforms” to the law.“Healthcare should not be a burden on consumers which is why we must delay the penalty for individuals” Kirk said in a statement. “Last July American businesses were given more time to provide employees health coverage. If a delay is good enough for businesses it should be good enough for all Americans.”",0
762,Wednesday night House Leadership withdrew legislation to fund the government through December in response to growing conservative criticism that the measure didn’t strip funding for ObamaCare. Congress must pass legislation to authorize continued government spending before September 30 or the government will shut down. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor had unveiled a plan that would split the ObamaCare funding from the underlying government spending but conservatives balked at the plan. Any action on spending now has been pushed to next week.Conservatives led by Sens. Ted Cruz and Mike Lee have argued that any measure to extend government spending authority should also include language to defund ObamaCare. On October 1 the health care exchanges authorized by ObamaCare where individuals can presumably shop for health insurance are set to open. On January 1 all Americans are mandated to have health insurance. On that date as well large subsidies and tax credits to supplement those insurance premiums will begin. Unless the law is uprooted now it will likely remain.Cantor’s plan envisioned the House passing a “clean” resolution to continue government spending one which absorbed the sequester cuts. It also would include a separate resolution that defunded all aspects of ObamaCare. Under Cantor’s plan the Senate would receive the “clean” resolution until it had voted on funding ObamaCare. The Senate would have to definitively vote on funding ObamaCare before it could vote to keep the government open.Conservatives rebelled arguing that the split resolutions offered nothing more than a symbolic vote against ObamaCare and removed all leverage against the unpopular law. Democrats in control of the Senate could vote down the ObamaCare defunding and then quickly authorize legislation to keep the government functioning.The issue is however far more complicated. Funding ObamaCare requires about $13 billion in annual appropriations that is subject to Congressional authorization. More than $70 billion a year however is funded by mandatory spending that isn’t subject to Congressional authorization. In other words Congress could eliminate all spending for ObamaCare but 70% of the program would march on.That said everything in life is done on the margins. Eliminating just a fraction of the overall spending on ObamaCare could upend the whole program. That is the hope of conservatives. And that hope cause GOP Leadership to blink.,1
763,As Detroit enters the federal bankruptcy process the city is proposing a controversial plan for paring some of the $5.7 billion it owes in retiree health costs: pushing many of those too young to qualify for Medicare out of city-run coverage and into the new insurance markets that will soon be operating under the Obama health care law.Officials say the plan would be part of a broader effort to save Detroit tens of millions of dollars in health costs each year a major element in a restructuring package that must be approved by a bankruptcy judge. It is being watched closely by municipal leaders around the nation many of whom complain of mounting unsustainable prices for the health care promised to retired city workers.Similar proposals that could shift public sector retirees into the new insurance markets called exchanges are already being planned or contemplated in places like Chicago; Sheboygan County Wis.; and Stockton Calif. While large employers that eliminate health benefits for full-time workers can be penalized under the health care law retirees are a different matter.“There’s fear and panic about what this means” said Michael Underwood 62 who retired from the Chicago Police Department after 30 years and has diabetes and Parkinson’s disease. Mr. Underwood who says he began working for the city when employees did not pay into future Medicare coverage is part of a group suing Chicago over its plan to phase many retirees out of city coverage during the next three and a half years. “I was promised health care for myself and my wife for life” he said.,0
764,"With just five days to go before Americans can begin signing up for medical coverage under the law the president poked fun at his Republican opponents saying: ""The closer we get the more desperate they get.""",0
765,"The sequester brings a lot of big damaging cuts to government programs and services. The problem is if Republicans get anything close to their way—and remember it's Democrats they're bargaining with so there's a good chance Republicans do get much of what they want— the solution could be as bad as the problem of sequestration. Social Security and Medicaid aren't sequestered. But cutting those programs has been on the Republican wish list for a long time and will be one of their demands.The question is how hard Democrats will fight to protect the programs that seniors rely on and that give non-seniors the promise of being able to retire without living in abject poverty.""The president has made one of his bottom lines that significant revenues have to be on the table"" said Chuck Loveless the director of legislation for AFSCME a major public services employees union. ""If he sticks to his guns on that I'm not worried but chained CPI is on his shortlist. We oppose that and it is a significant cut to social security.""It should go without saying that if Democrats agree to cut Social Security benefits even at the insistence of Republicans come 2014 and 2016 Republicans will wage campaign attacks against Democrats for having cut Social Security. But with Republicans so insistent and a few Democrats wobbly on the issue New York Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler says that ""If you go in and decide to fix sequestration how much longer can you exempt entitlements. It's difficult to do if you want to get bipartisan agreement.""This is the fight. Can Republicans protect tax subsidies for oil companies by cutting Social Security benefits for seniors? Are Democrats going to make that deal? If Americans don't want Social Security cut—and they don't even if politicians are calling it ""chained CPI"" and pretending it's not really a cut—that needs to be crystal clear to Congress and the president.Tell Congress it's time to end tax loopholes for corporations and the wealthy.",1
766,A big Freudian slip from House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan as he unveils his plan to repeal Obamacare and replace Medicare with a voucher system:This to us is something that we're not going to give up on because we're not going to give up on destroying the health care system for the American people.Thanks Paul. Now tell us something we didn't already know.Please click here to sign the petition from Daily Kos and the Democratic Congressional Campaign committee telling Paul Ryan that turning Medicare into a voucher program is not an option.,0
767,"For a brief piece of background I am a family practice physician in a multi-specialty group of about 60 doctors mostly primary care.I think most people would agree that the American healthcare system has a lot of flaws. One of the biggest flaws is our fee-for-service system in general. It doesn't make any sense but I get paid the same to see someone for an ear infection as I do to see someone with high blood pressure high cholesterol and diabetes. Someone comes for an appointment and based on the level of detail I obtain in the history the level of detail needed in physical examination and the complexity of medical decision-making that determines the fee for the visit. So as you can imagine an ear infection or sore throat requires a LOT less work than managing three or more chronic problems and the medications labs monitoring tests etc. that go along with them. But again you are paid the same to see the ear infection patient as you are to see the person with uncontrolled diabetes high BP and high cholesterol.On the surface that makes no sense at all but the thinking is that it probably costs too much for the ear infection too little for the diabetes/BP/cholesterol patient but it all evens out in the long run. The rules for 'coding' a level of service for an appointment govern the fees and they are relatively simple as otherwise it would just be too complicated to have a different fee structure for every diagnosis. Anyway the idea is that it all comes out in the wash. That might be true in a simple world but of course we live in a complex world with a lot of moving parts.As you can see the fee-for-service environment does not really incentivize physicians to focus their efforts on chronic disease management. I'm not implying that physicians are not trying to do a good job or are just in it to make as much money as possible but let's face it: if you make the same amount per patient and you can see 30 patients with ear infections or 15 diabetic/hypertensive/hyperlipidemic patients which would you choose? How would you set up your schedule?Everyone agrees that prevention is the most cost-effective way to keep people healthy. Vaccines for example are arguably the single most cost-effective thing in all of medicine (get your flu vaccine if you have not already done so by the way!). Preventative care is now covered without a co-pay because of the ACA. That is awesome. However better care/control of chronic disease doesn't pay well as discussed above. But better control of diabetes of BP of cholesterol of COPD of asthma of heart failure will save lots and lots and lots of money in the long run because complications of all these diseases are expensive. It costs a LOT to be in the hospital to have a heart bypass to have dialysis etc. A rough estimate is that a well-controlled diabetic costs the system an average of $4000 per year to take care of but an uncontrolled diabetic will cost $16000 or more. So why would we pay doctors the same for an ear infection as we would to take care of serious chronic disease?Part of the answer unfortunately is that people switch insurances and by the time they develop more significant complications they are on Medicare anyway so UHC Humana Anthem don't need to worry about paying for dialysis. In the long run though it saves us all money if we do a better job of taking care of chronic illness. So it makes sense to try to incentivize doctors to improve our chronic disease management instead of incentivizing doctors to just see as many patients as possible in the day.So enough background. Here's the good stuff. The ACA provides funding and guidance for a new way to approach health care. The Comprehensive Primary Care initiative is a program that involves about 500 practices across the country in several geographic areas. Southwest Ohio/N. KY New Jersey Arkansas Colorado New York Oregon and Oklahoma have participating practices. Practices were selected based on a number of factors including past willingness to participate in such things as NCQA quality recognition and patient-centered medical home (PCMH) certification. You can read more here: http://innovation.cms.gov/...Basically CMS (center for Medicare and Medicaid services) provides funding outside of the fee-for-service environment for practices to do a better job of chronic disease management. There is/was a detailed application process and multiple milestones you have to meet but a lot of it boils down to CMS providing additional monies for practices to use as they see fit in order to help improve the care for their patients particularly (although not exclusively) those with higher risk chronic illness.The whole thing is actually really interesting. While there are quite a lot of specifics there are also a lot of areas open to interpretation. CMS is partnering with multiple private insurance carriers to provide a monthly fee (outside of any appointment or fee-for-service interaction) to physician practices in order to help those practices invest in infrastructure which will help improve patient care. The amount per patient per month is based on risk assessment. Basically the more diagnoses and the more complicated a patient is the higher the monthly fee. A well-controlled diabetic would have a lower fee than a diabetic with chronic kidney disease heart disease and neuropathy. So right off the bat you can see how this is a paradigm shift from the traditional fee-for-service environment. You may actually be paid more to take care of a more complicated person and try to keep them out of the hospital.However and this is a BIG part the money from this CPC initiative can NOT be paid to physicians as compensation. It is to be used to improve infrastructure. This is actually pretty cool because instead of just paying doctors more and saying ""hey if we pay you more you'll do a better job right?"" CMS is saying ""we will give you money to use as you see fit (within the structure of our program and its milestones) to improve patient care which should improve outcomes decrease severe complication rates improve patient satisfaction and eventually decrease overall costs through an investment up front.""If you hadn't already guessed my group has several practices involved in the CPCI program and we are excited about it. I don't know what the other 490-some practices across the country are doing but we have used the money to hire more staff including what we call Care Coordinators for each office an RN who can reach out to patients before during and after appointments to see how we can better coordinate care. We try to have labs drawn before folks come for appointments so we can have already reviewed the results before walking in the room. This allows for more efficient care. If someone's cholesterol is not to goal for example we can increase the dose of their cholesterol medication while sitting with them and explaining why an LDL goal of under 70 is the target. This works a lot better than a medical assistant calling someone and playing phone tag three days after their appointment to try to make sure they know that the new dose is 40 mg instead of 20. Anyway the Care Coordinator can help reach out to people who might need help paying for meds and see what assistance programs might help someone. She can help someone who was recently in the hospital understand their new medication regimen and help set up their follow up. If someone doesn't go for the colonoscopy or mammogram that we ordered she can call them and find out why and/or encourage them to go (and maybe mention that preventative care is covered 100% now!). She can review their chart ahead of time and put in a reminder for the doctor that the patient is due for a pneumonia vaccine or a shingles vaccine. This is all part of the team-based approach to care which is helping to improve patient outcomes. Our practice would not really been able to afford a Care Coordinator without the CPCI monies. Our group has also decided to hire a diabetes educator. Insurance is often squirrelly about paying for diabetes education despite study after study clearly showing the benefits. Now we will be able to offer diabetes eduction free of charge to all of our patients. This is pretty great all around. The doctors get more help the patients get more individualized attention and care outcomes improve which specifically means someone didn't have a stroke. Someone didn't lose their vision because of diabetes. Someone had a precancerous colon polyp removed instead of being diagnosed with metastatic cancer a couple years later. Someone's grandmother didn't lose her foot. Oh and all that stuff also saves money.That's the other piece of the CPCI which is a multi-year venture: ""shared savings."" You can calculate how much a population of patients is likely to cost over say three years based on how sick they are. If people get their blood pressure cholesterol blood sugar asthma under better control they will cost less to take care of because they will have fewer ER visits fewer hospitalizations fewer procedures. Sure they might take more medications get more frequent lab tests maybe more frequent (outpatient) doctor appointments but this leads to an overall reduction of the cost of care. So for the additional work to do a better job of taking care of patients practices in each region get a chance to share in the $$ saved by providing more efficient care. This will be calculated and distributed equally among the 75 or so practices in each region.There's of course a lot more to the story but this diary is already rather lengthy. I'm excited about the program though. It really is a win-win. It has a lot of the things that us progressives like: government-initiated innovation. Science-based (or to use the medical buzzword evidence-based) care. Regulations on how the money can be used with the greater good in mind. Short term investment for long term success (I didn't mention that the money is eventually phased out with the hope that the infrastructure improvements will lead to overall better reimbursements and a focus on ""pay-for-performance"" or better pay for better quality care). Using government dollars to help those who need it most (ie sicker patients). Shared benefits in the long run for all of us. If we are all healthier we cost less to the healthcare system. We are more productive workers. We have fewer people on disability. We end up putting more $$ back into the economy and indirectly increase government revenue (if you can work more and make more money because you are healthier you end up paying more taxes and of course can purchase more goods and services).Anyway it's a relatively small part of the ACA and unless you go to a practice involved in the CPCI you likely would never hear about it. But in the long run the idea is that the extra $$ will help to transform how we provide care therefore leading to a sea change in primary care across the country. If you get better outcomes improve patient satisfaction AND save money while practicing a certain way every practice is going to want to adopt these methods. Over the next few years the 500 practices will be sharing (HIPAA-compliant) data successes and failures to try to come up with ""best practices"" we can all use to keep people healthier longer. Because everyone benefits from that and that is really what the Affordable Care Act is about.",0
768,WASHINGTON — Healthcare for the nation’s poor once viewed as especially vulnerable in this era of budget cutting has emerged as a surprisingly secure government entitlement with as much political clout as the Medicare and Social Security retirement programs.Even as President Obama and congressional Republicans gear up for a new budget battle Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program which together provide coverage to more than 1 in 5 Americans and almost 1 in 3 Californians over the course of a year appear off-limits despite their huge price tag.AdvertisementThe president protected Medicaid in 2011 when Congress and the White House slashed $1.2 trillion in federal spending including on Medicare — the healthcare plan for seniors and disabled people — as part of a deal to raise the nation’s debt limit.Medicaid was spared again last month in the budget compromise that raised tax rates on high-income households — a deal that included even more Medicare cuts.AdvertisementNow with Obama banking on a dramatic Medicaid expansion next year under his landmark healthcare law the White House is drawing another bright line around the program. The president explicitly defended Medicaid in his inaugural address and top aides have amplified his words since.“Medicaid cuts from this president from this administration are not on the table” Gene Sperling the head of the National Economic Council at the White House declared in a speech Thursday to a healthcare conference explicitly ruling out even cuts that the administration previously had considered.Advertisement“We’ve made a tough choice” to wall off Medicaid from cuts he said making the budgetary trade-off explicit: “It means we will have to look harder for Medicare savings.”A major reason for the White House position is the key role that Medicaid plays in Obama’s health reform effort. The president’s law is slated to provide nearly $1 trillion in new federal aid to states over the next decade to help them open Medicaid to all low-income Americans for the first time starting in 2014. That is central to the law’s program for expanding insurance coverage to an estimated 30 million people by 2022.AdvertisementPreserving Medicaid funding became even more crucial to the Obama administration after the Supreme Court ruled last summer that states were not required to expand their Medicaid coverage. Administration officials are working hard to convince states to expand and do not want any federal funding cuts that could discourage governors from implementing the law.“There is a big irony” said Ron Pollack executive director of Washington-based Families USA a leading Medicaid advocate. “The fact that the Supreme Court undermined the Medicaid expansion is now resulting in greater support and a deeper commitment to making sure the program is not cut back.”AdvertisementPaying for Medicaid remains a major challenge for states. The program has been jointly funded by states and the federal government since it was created. And many states including California Illinois and New York have had to make painful cutbacks in recent years to balance their budgets by reducing physician fees and paring benefits such as dental care.At the same time Republicans are working to slash Medicaid spending to balance the federal budget. They advocate turning the program into a block grant to states which they say would be more efficient and also put a limit on future federal spending.AdvertisementCutting Medicaid was a centerpiece of budget plans pushed by Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) the House Budget Committee chairman. Ryan’s running mate on the GOP presidential ticket Mitt Romney advocated similar cuts.House Republicans are gearing up for another run at trimming Medicaid as they prepare a budget blueprint that they say would balance the budget in 10 years without raising taxes a goal that would likely require trillions of dollars in new cuts.Advertisement“The need for reform is that much more urgent” said Rep. Todd Rokita (R-Ind.) who sponsored legislation last year backed by 48 GOP lawmakers to cap federal Medicaid spending which would have effectively cut approximately $2 trillion over the next decade. “It is a matter of saving these things for future generations.”But congressional Republicans who tried unsuccessfully in the 1990s to scale back Medicaid will likely have an even harder time now.AdvertisementEnrollment in Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program which was created in 1997 to expand government-subsidized coverage for children has surged by more than 70% since 2000 as states expanded their safety nets after businesses laid off workers or eliminated health benefits.That has meant Medicaid a program established in 1965 to help Americans on welfare is increasingly essential to millions of working families who cannot afford health insurance and to elderly and disabled Americans in need of long-term care. Medicaid is the single largest payer for nursing homes in the country.Advertisement“This is now a middle-class entitlement that touches far more Americans than many people realize” said Colleen M. Grogan a Medicaid authority at the University of Chicago. Half of all Americans in 2011 either received Medicaid or had a friend or family member who received it according to a national survey by the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation.Romney and other conservatives criticized this as a debilitating dependency during the 2012 presidential campaign. But many state leaders — Republican and Democratic — have come to rely on Medicaid despite its flaws to protect their most vulnerable residents.AdvertisementMedicaid also draws important support from influential hospital and physician groups which have rallied behind the program even as many criticize it for paying too little. Without Medicaid many medical providers would have to care for even more patients unable to pay their bills.Just last month a coalition of medical societies including several from conservative states helped defeat an attempt by congressional Republicans to cut federal aid intended to increase Medicaid fees paid to primary care physicians.AdvertisementSimilar lobbying in state capitals has also convinced several Republican governors to drop opposition to expanding Medicaid under the healthcare law. Most recently Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer announced last month that she would take the assistance after an intense lobbying effort by hospitals and businesses which argued that without the additional aid healthcare providers would be swamped by uninsured patients.Medicaid’s political clout will only increase in the coming years as close to 20 million more Americans come to depend on the program under the Affordable Care Act Grogan predicted. In some states as much as a quarter of the population could soon be on Medicaid.AdvertisementFederal spending on the program which topped $262 billion last year is expected to surpass $581 billion by 2021 according to estimates by independent actuaries at the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.Obama’s healthcare law is creating other challenges for many states which are scrambling to get ready for the historic Medicaid expansion while also trying to ensure their programs pay for healthcare more efficiently.Advertisement“We’re a long way from seeing many of these issues resolved” said Diana Dooley California’s health and human services secretary who oversees one of the most cash-strapped Medicaid programs in the country. “But I’m encouraged that there seems to be a recognition of the importance of the Medicaid program. The conversations are going in the right direction.”noam.levey@latimes.com,0
769,Back to previous pageSen. Menendez contacted top officials in friend’s Medicare disputeSen. Robert Menendez raised concerns with top federal health-care officials twice in recent years about their finding that a Florida eye doctor — a close friend and major campaign donor — had overbilled the government by $8.9 million for care at his clinic Menendez aides said Wednesday.Menendez (D-N.J.) initially contacted federal officials in 2009 about the government’s audit of Salomon Melgen complaining to the director overseeing Medicare payments that it was unfair to penalize the doctor because the billing rules were ambiguous the aides said.Last year in a meeting with the acting administrator of the agency in charge of Medicare and Medicaid Menendez again questioned whether federal auditors had been fair in their assessment of Melgen’s billing for eye injections to treat macular degeneration the senator’s aides said.The agency had ordered Melgen to repay the $8.9 million and at the time of both conversations Melgen was disputing the agency’s conclusion. His appeal continues to this day.Menendez’s office provided this account of his contacts with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services after The Washington Post asked about the role he had played in the long-standing dispute between Melgen and the agency over his billing practices.Menendez who became chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this month is under scrutiny because of his close relationship with Melgen. The doctor donated more than $700000 last year to Menendez’s reelection campaign and other Senate Democrats. And when Melgen needed help with a port security contract in the Dominican Republic last year Menendez urged U.S. officials to press the country to carry out the multimillion-dollar agreement.Menendez is facing a Senate ethics inquiry about two free trips he took in 2010 on Melgen’s private plane to the doctor’s seaside mansion in the Dominican Republic. Menendez acknowledged this month that he had not properly disclosed the trips. He wrote a personal check for $58500 to reimburse Melgen.Meanwhile a federal investigation of what law enforcement officials say are allegations of health-care fraud by Melgen escalated last week when FBI agents and health-care investigators raided medical offices in West Palm Beach where he runs Vitreo-Retinal Consultants. The teams spent nearly 24 hours searching the premises and removing dozens of boxes containing billing and medical records and computer files.Federal investigators and health-care auditors have had concerns about Melgen’s billing practices at various times over the past decade two former federal officials said. In part they have examined the volume of eye injections surgeries and laser treatments performed at his West Palm Beach clinic.But a Menendez aide said Wednesday that the senator did not know Melgen was under formal investigation for possible fraud until the well-publicized raid last week.“Senator Menendez was never aware of and has not intervened in any Medicare fraud investigation on behalf of Vitreo Retinal Consultants” his office said in a statement.The senator’s conversation with federal officials about Melgen’s case was unrelated to the current investigation Menendez aides said.“On a separate issue regarding Medicare reimbursement he has in the past raised concerns with CMS about conflicting guidelines and ambiguity in CMS rules that are difficult for providers to understand and can lead to judgments after the fact” the statement said. “His interest was in making sure providers were not penalized if CMS clarified or changed the rules of the game retroactively.”Alan Reider Melgen’s attorney said Wednesday that his client has returned the government money in dispute but is contesting the CMS audit finding so he can reclaim the money. Reider said Melgen believes he was following Medicare guidelines. Reider added that Melgen was not aware that his practice was under investigation until federal agents arrived at his clinic last week.At issue in the reimbursement dispute is Melgen’s multiple use of individual vials for eye injections to treat macular degeneration. Federal auditors have said Melgen often billed the government three to four times for injections from a single vial according to two federal officials and lawyers familiar with the case.The government’s Medicare program reimburses providers $2000 for each vial so Melgen was billing $6000 to $8000 for each vial.Melgen’s attorneys said the doctor was properly billing for treating four patients with medical injections albeit from one vial.After CMS ruled in 2008 that Melgen would have to repay the government he and his legal representatives contacted Menendez’s office arguing that the finding was unfair the senator’s aides said. Menendez’s staff members had several conversations with agency officials to learn more about the billing rules and the details of Melgen’s case in particular the aides said.In July 2009 Menendez called Jonathan Blum the Medicare director at CMS to express concern the aides said. Menendez brought up Melgen’s case they said in the context of broader concerns about the guidelines.Then in June 2012 Menendez raised Melgen’s case again at a meeting with CMS Acting Administrator Marilyn Tavenner aides recounted. They said the primary subject of the meeting was the implementation of President Obama’s health-care overhaul.The aides said Menendez never urged the CMS to take specific action on Melgen’s case.Blum and Tavenner declined to comment through a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services.Melgen frequently cited his connection to Menendez according to two former federal officials and doctors in South Florida.When federal health-care fraud investigators were questioning him several years ago about his billing practices he invoked the senator’s name the former officials said.“He used Menendez’s name all the time. He would say “Menendez is a good friend of mine and he knows I never did anything wrong’ ” said a former senior federal official familiar with the investigation.In Florida it was more threatening several doctors in the South Florida region recounted. After one local eye surgeon criticized Melgen’s treatment methods in discussions with other Florida doctors Melgen warned that he had important friends in the Senate including Menendez said two doctors familiar with the exchange. They said Melgen cautioned that his Washington friends could arrange an intensive federal audit of the surgeon’s practice.Reider the attorney said he had no knowledge of any comments Melgen may have made mentioning his friendship to Menendez.Melgen came to the attention of fraud investigators amid complaints from other local eye doctors alleging that his treatments were often unnecessary a waste of money and sometimes harmful to patients’ eyesight the two former federal officials and several doctors said.At the same time investigators considered him an “outlier” compared with his peers because of the volume of his billing and the rate at which he administered eye injections and performed procedures on government-insured patients the former officials said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is still ongoing.Melgen “was somebody who consistently showed up on the radar and was being looked at quite a bit” said a former senior health-care fraud investigator. “The sheer volume itself is going to keep him on the radar.’’When federal investigators interviewed Melgen he tried to exert pressure on them by mentioning the names of Menendez and other influential politicians the former fraud investigator said. “We thought it was odd because Menendez was in New Jersey and this guy was in Florida’’ the official said.A second former federal official recounted that Menendez’s name came up repeatedly when Melgen was interviewed by investigators from the Justice Department and the inspector general’s office at the Department of Health and Human Services.“He was using Menendez more as a character reference” the official said. “He thought he was untouchable.”The federal interest in Melgen stretches back 10 years when investigators interviewed Philip Rosenfeld a nationally known retina specialist about the volume of treatments Melgen was performing said several eye doctors in South Florida.These doctors said Rosenfeld who pioneered the use of Avastin injections for macular degeneration to stem eyesight loss had long been troubled by Melgen’s methods.FBI agents recently interviewed Rosenfeld again this time two days before they raided Melgen’s clinic the doctors said.Reached at his home in Key Biscayne Rosenfeld declined to comment.Doctors in south Florida said that they have been fearful of criticizing Melgen publicly and that his Washington connections may be protecting him.In 2010 Melgen scolded eye surgeon Randy Katz for publicly criticizing the quality of his care. According to two fellow doctors Melgen cited his Senate connections and told Katz that he could face a Medicare investigation.Katz did not respond to requests for comment. Melgen’s attorney declined to discuss his client’s conversations with Katz or allegations that his client had threatened other doctors.Soon after the encounter according to a copy of a letter obtained by The Post Katz wrote to Palm Beach doctors in praise of Melgen.“It has come to my attention that certain statements I made have been misunderstood as criticisms of Dr. Melgen” Katz wrote in the open letter. “To be clear I know Dr. Salomon Melgen to be a capable andhighly-skilled vitreo-retinal surgeon. . . . If you hear any suggestion that I have said otherwise you should disregard that suggestion as being false.”Alice Crites contributed to this report.Read more from Washington Post Politics:Exclusive resort at center of Menendez allegationsThe Fix: What we know (and don’t know) about the Menendez allegationsNew Jersey Democrats watch and wait on Menendez,0
770,It would have been even more controversial than Obamacare it probably wouldn't have got through Congress but if it had it would have had the huge advantage of simplicity and clarity.,1
771,If health insurance prices triple do we still have to call Obamacare the “Affordable Care Act”?A report released yesterday by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce reveals the devastating reality many Americans will face when Obamacare is in full force next year. While the majority of Americans will likely see their healthcare premiums increase no one will swallow the cost burden more than young Americans.Previous studies have reported that youth healthcare premiums could increase as much as 45 percent but the the House Committee report concluded that young Americans could see an increase as much as 203 percent.“Recent college graduates with entry-level jobs who are struggling to pay off student loan debt could see their premiums increase on average between 145 and 189 percent” the report said. “Some studies estimate young adults could experience premium increases as high as 203 percent. Any increase let alone tripling current costs could break the bank for young adults who have just started out on their own.”The current average payment for health care premiums among young Americans is $648 but will increase to $1872 under the Obamacare legislation. The graph below breaks down the average increases in healthcare premiums for young Americans in major cities:According to the report young Americans are disproportionately affected by Obamacare for three reasons:Guaranteed Issue and Community Rating: In other words price controls. Obamacare mandates that all Americans pay healthcare premiums regardless of anticipated medical expenses. Young Americans must subsidize retirees who use healthcare far more often to level the insurance price disparity between younger and older Americans. Essential Health Benefits: Obamacare mandates certain health servives be covered by health insurance. These include coverage for preventive and wellness services chronic disease management rehabilitative and habilitative services and many more. In short the more categories you are forced to cover the more expensive your premium will be. No more affordable catastrophic plans. Taxes and Fees on Plans Drugs and Medical Devices: The total cost of new taxes and fees on drug manufacturers device manufacturers and health care plans is $165 billion. This will ultimately be passed on to the consumer in higher premiums.Families will also see a significant increase in their healthcare premiums. One of the studies in the report found that a family could see the costs of their premiums rise to $7186 in the next decade.With a stagnant economy unprecedented levels of unemployment (youth unemployment currently 17.6 percent) and average household expenses on the rise (gas food energy etc) there are very few people that can afford $800-$4000 more to pay for the rise in healthcare premiums.Remember when President Obama said “if you like your healthcare plan you can keep your healthcare plan”? Or that Obamacare would “bring down premiums by $2500 for the typical family.” Me too.,1
772,Republicans’ efforts raise the same perplexing question posed by The Missourian: What drives Tea Party Republicans and their financial backers? What calculation persuades them that repealing the health care law is worth the risk? Indeed whose interests do they represent?Nearly 6 in 10 Americans disapprove of trying to stop the law by cutting its financing. Even among those who don’t like the law less than half want their representatives in Congress to try to make it fail.It is tempting to discard the Tea Party activists driving the Republican Party as crazy — as some commentators have — motivated by fear and willing to believe that default won’t cause much harm and might even act as a purgative to free the economy of a bloated government.“They listen to nobody but themselves” the Harvard political scientist Theda Skocpol told me. “They are convinced of their rectitude and convinced that they alone are qualified to save America from the dire threat of Obama and his polices. They have worked themselves into a dangerous place.”Their relationship with reality can take peculiar turns. Reflexive opponents of “government” they can exhibit little sense of what the government actually does.And yet the argument that half the Republican Party has simply lost its mind has to be an unsatisfactory answer especially considering the sophistication of some of the deep-pocketed backers of the Tea Party insurgency.There is a plausible alternative to irrationality. Flawed though it may turn out to be Obamacare as the Affordable Care Act is popularly known could fundamentally change the relationship between working Americans and their government. This could pose an existential threat to the small-government credo that has defined the G.O.P. for four decades.,0
773,"Jayne O'DonnellUSA TODAYQuestionable Medicaid reports coming from states including Illinois%2C Texas and MichiganWoman due in February fears she%27ll be without insurance coverage when her baby is born.More complete Medicaid files going from HHS to states this weekThe federal health care exchange is incorrectly determining that some people are eligible for Medicaid when they clearly are not leaving them with little chance to get the subsidized insurance they are entitled to as the Dec. 23 deadline for enrollment approaches.State and industry officials haven't quantified the problem yet but the National Association of State Medicaid Directors may release information next week after following up on reports from around the country says Executive Director Matt Salo.Here's what happens: When consumers applying for insurance put their income information into subsidy calculators on HealthCare.gov — the exchange handling insurance sales for 36 states — it tells them how much financial assistance they qualify for or that they are eligible for Medicaid. If it's the latter consumers aren't able to obtain subsidies toward the insurance although they could buy full-priced plans.If the Medicaid determination is wrong consumers should file an appeal with the federal marketplace says Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman Joanne Peters but she says she does not have an estimate on how long that would take.Brokers are reporting that some of their clients are in insurance limbo as they wait for the error to be corrected by HHS or their states so they can reapply.Jessica Waltman top lobbyist for the National Association of Health Underwriters says she's heard a number of reports from around the country of people making as much as $80000 a year being told they qualify for Medicaid on HealthCare.gov.""I have heard on multiple occasions from brokers in various states over the past eight weeks that they have had wacky Medicaid determinations with people who clearly make way too much money for Medicaid"" she says.HealthCare.gov is ""working smoothly for the vast majority of users"" says Peters but she noted some people may have technical difficulties or complicated family or tax situations that require extra assistance.HHS has added more call center employees and in-person assistants for people who need extra help she says.But insurance brokers say that when people call the HealthCare.gov ""800"" number to explain that they can't possibly be eligible for Medicaid they are told they are eligible if the site says so.""It's a very very unfortunate state of affairs"" says Waltman.HHS said it will begin sending Medicaid application files to states this week given that HealthCare.gov's mechanism to transfer accounts to state Medicaid offices still isn't working. The data received up until now haven't given states enough information to determine Medicaid eligibility says Salo but he hopes that as promised the new files will.""Claims from some states about our process for testing the Medicaid eligibility and enrollment systems are inaccurate"" says Peters. ""We are eager to work with states to ensure their systems are functioning properly and to extend Medicaid coverage to those who are eligible through the generous Medicaid funding made possible by the Affordable Care Act.""HHS is working ""extremely hard"" to make sure people will have coverage no matter what on Jan. 1 says Salo. While states support that goal ""some want more assurances that people enrolled in Medicaid are actually eligible"" he says.HHS has told states they won't be penalized if they enroll people in Medicaid who HHS erroneously said were eligible says Salo.That's little consolation for consumers who can't buy subsidized insurance on the exchange because of apparent mistakes.Jacob Hawkins of Plano Texas makes about $50000 a year as a self-employed pool builder yet his family of three was deemed eligible for Medicaid. His wife Holly is due to have their second child in February and is worried she won't have insurance in time. She filed an appeal of the Medicaid determination but doubts it will be approved before the Dec. 23 deadline.""I'm frustrated mad and there's no one to help"" says Hawkins.Being married with a $50000 income will get you a decline from Medicaid even with a pregnant wife says Hawkins' broker Connie Louanne Trebing. "" I know because I just had a couple declined in a similar situation"" she says.Some of the files of those supposedly eligible for Medicaid in Texas include people who don't live in Texas and who are already signed up for Medicaid says Stephanie Goodman spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission.Illinois expects about 19000 files shortly from HHS. Illinois state spokesman Mike Claffey says he doesn't know how many may have problems but Chicago broker Jordan Wishner says seven of them will be from his office and definitely will be wrong.He has three clients of his own and an agent in his office has another four who are clearly above 138% of the federal poverty limit ($32499 for a family of four) yet are being told they are eligible for Medicaid which blocks their efforts to buy subsidized insurance.""What am I supposed to do with the clients that are being told they qualify for Medicaid when they actually do not?"" asks Wishner who owns The Health Insurance Shoppe a retail insurance store. ""Send in an appeal with 16 days left? Seriously?""With this much uncertainty ""it's frustrating that there is no place for a broker to get help with errant cases and try to avert problems"" says Waltman.State exchanges and insurance companies have dedicated customer service support for insurance agents and brokers who try to correct problems ""before they escalate"" says Waltman. On the federal exchange brokers call the same help line as consumers.""We do not want this woman giving birth and not having coverage"" says Waltman referring to Hawkins. ""This is absolutely what the law was trying to prevent from ever happening again.""Insurance shopping? Tell us about it at healthinsurance@usatoday.com",1
774,In a poll released Tuesday one day after President Obama slammed Republicans for what he dishonestly described as a “government shutdown” Rasmussen has found that when it comes to cutting health care costs a majority of 51% favor “having a partial government shutdown until Democrats and Republicans agree on what spending for the health care law to cut.”An even higher number of 53% favor a partial government shutdown until “Democrats and Republicans can agree on what [general] spending to cut.” Only 37% oppose.For obvious reasons the media refuse to make clear that it is not the GOP proposing any kind of government shutdown partial or otherwise. The GOP’s plan is to kill the ObamaCare debacle with a bill that funds everything but the president’s job-killing health care plan. It is up to the president and Democrat-led Senate then to decide if this wildly unpopular drag on our economy is worth shutting down the government.Both the media and the president are eager for this showdown; both relish the idea of replaying the 1990s when the media and the Clinton White House worked together to bludgeon then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich over a similar gambit.This poll though shows that this tactic might not work as well this time. Just for starters people are much more concerned about the deficit today than they were in the mid-nineties; and there was no boondoggle like ObamaCare hanging out there as a prize in a shutdown showdown.Make no mistake the media will ignore this poll. The results do not fit the media’s pro-ObamaCare Narrative and only interferes with the reality they are attempting to manufacture that says a shutdown can only mean disaster for the GOP.But to those interested in reality this poll should be food for thought.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC,1
775,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Just two weeks after President Barack Obama saw his Democratic Party put up an unyielding front against Republicans his coalition is showing signs of stress.From health care to spying to pending budget deals many congressional Democrats are challenging the administration and pushing for measures that the White House has not embraced.Some Democrats are seeking to extend the enrollment period for new health care exchanges. Others want to place restraints on National Security Administration surveillance capabilities. Still others are standing tough against any budget deal that uses long-term reductions in major benefit programs to offset immediate cuts in defense.Though focused on disparate issues the Democrats' anxieties are connected by timing and stand out all the more when contrasted with the remarkable unity the party displayed during the recent showdown over the partial government shutdown and the confrontation over raising the nation's borrowing limit.""That moment was always going to be fleeting"" said Matt Bennett who worked in the Clinton White House and who regularly consults with Obama aides. ""The White House every White House understands that these folks driven either by principle or the demands of the politics of their state have to put daylight between themselves and the president on occasion.""Obama and the Democrats emerged from the debt and shutdown clash with what they wanted: a reopened government a higher debt ceiling and a Republican Party reeling in the depths of public opinion polls.But within days attention turned to the problem-riddled launch of the 3-year-old health care law's enrollment stage and revelations that the U.S. had been secretly monitoring the communications of as many as 35 allied leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel. And with new budget talks underway Democratic Party liberals reiterated demands that Obama not agree to changes that reduce Social Security or Medicare benefits even in the improbable event Republicans agree to increase budget revenues.Story continuesThe fraying on the Democratic Party edges is hardly unraveling Obama's support and it pales when compared to the upheaval within the Republican Party as it distances itself from the tactics of tea party conservatives. But the pushback from Democrats comes as Obama is trying to draw renewed attention to his agenda including passage of an immigration overhaul his jobs initiatives and the benefits of his health care law.The computer troubles that befell the start of health insurance sign-ups have caused the greatest anxiety. Republicans pounced on the difficulties as evidence of deeper flaws in the law. But Democrats even as they defended the policy also demanded answers in the face of questions from their constituents.""The fact is that the administration really failed these Americans"" Rep. Allyson Schwartz D-Pa. told Medicare chief Marilyn Tavenner at a hearing this week. ""So going forward there can be just no more excuses.""In the Senate 10 Democrats signed on to a letter seeking an unspecified extension of the enrollment period which ends March 31. ""As you continue to fix problems with the website and the enrollment process it is critical that the administration be open to modifications that provide greater flexibility for the American people seeking to access health insurance"" Sen. Jeanne Shaheen D-N.H. wrote.Another Democratic senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia has called for a one-year delay in the requirement that virtually all Americans have health insurance or pay a fine.On Thursday White House chief of staff Denis McDonough Tavenner and the White House's designated troubleshooter for the health care website Jeffrey Zients met privately with Senate Democrats.Officials said some of the lawmakers spoke critically of the website's widely publicized problems and sought reassurances they would soon be fixed.In response Zients said there already have been some improvements and individuals are now able to sign up in larger numbers than was the case a month ago. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity saying they were not authorized to discuss events at a private meeting.And in an interview on CNN Vice President Joe Biden apologized for the problems. ""There's no excuse"" he said ""We just have to fix it.""Democrats who have talked to White House officials in recent days describe them as rattled by the health care blunders. But they say they are confident that the troubled website used for enrollment will be corrected and fully operational by the end of November.The spying revelations also have created some tensions between the administration and Democrats. Sen. Dianne Feinstein chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and until now a staunch supporter of the NSA's surveillance called for a ""total review of all intelligence programs"" following the Merkel reports.She said that when it came to the NSA collecting intelligence on the leaders of allies such as France Spain Mexico and Germany ""Let me state unequivocally: I am totally opposed.""In the House Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois a Democratic member of the House intelligence committee complained that the intelligence committees had been kept out of the loop about the collection of data on foreign leaders.""Why did we not know that heads of state were being eavesdropped on spied on?"" she asked Obama administration intelligence officials on Tuesday. ""We are the Intelligence Committee. And we did not -- we didn't know that. And now all of us all of us are dealing with a problem in our international relations. There will be changes.""With Congress renewing budget talks Wednesday liberals have been outspoken in their insistence that Democrats vigorously resist efforts to reduce long-term deficits with savings in Social Security or Medicare. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont an independent who usually votes with Democrats has been the most outspoken saying he fears a budget deal will contain a proposal in Obama's budget to reduce cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security and other benefit programs.Obama however has proposed that remedy only if Republicans agree to raise tax revenue a bargain that GOP lawmakers involved in the discussions made clear they would reject. Moreover leaders from both parties as well as White House officials have signaled that in budget talks they are looking for a small budget deal not the type of ""grand bargain"" that would embrace such a revenue-for-benefit-cuts deal.Still many liberals warn that such cuts aren't palatable even if coupled with additional revenues.""The idea the notion that we're going to solve this problem or it's going to be OK if we were able to raise revenue and cut this thing back at the same time it just isn't going to fly outside of Washington"" said Jim Dean chairman of the liberal advocacy group Democracy for America.___Follow Jim Kuhnhenn at http://twitter.com/jkuhnhenn___AP Special Correspondent David Espo contributed to this report.",0

778,CNN has blamed Christians for the problem of Americans without health insurance calling it “The Obamacare ‘scandal’ you haven’t heard about.” In an article on CNN.com’s Belief Blog CNN writer John Blake says that while famous pastors “preach in states where crosses and church steeples dot the skyline” they do nothing about “the poor who can’t get the health insurance they would receive if they lived elsewhere.”That refers in turn to the decision of twenty-five states not to participate in Obamacare’s expanded Medicaid funding. The states were allowed to opt out following last year’s controversial Supreme Court decision on Obamacare which upheld the law as a whole but struck down the mandatory state participation in Medicaid expansion citing the protection provided to state powers under the Tenth Amendment.Some Republican states took the funding anyway which provides health insurance subsidies for households with incomes up to 138% of the poverty level. Though the federal government will initially cover almost all of the cost many Republican governors are wary of potential future costs and are also worried about the effect on the federal budget itself. Many are also opposed to participating in the Obamacare program on principle.CNN seems to think that the choice to opt out of Obamacare is somehow the responsibility of well-known pastors such as Joel Osteen and T.D. Jakes who declined to comment for Blake’s article. One minister Rev. Phil Wages said he would not preach that states should accept Medicaid funding because he does not believe that care for the poor is the primary responsibility of the government according to Christian teachings.Beyond that most churches are non-profit organizations whose tax-exempt status might be threatened if they became involved in political causes. Blake recognizes that but strongly suggests that churches have a duty regardless. (Curiously he does not suggest that churches should preach against Obamacare because of the millions of families that are losing their health insurance plans contrary to the president’s promises.)Blake covers different perspectives on the question of speaking out. But the premise of CNN’s article is that churches are to blame for Obamacare’s failures–not the federal government not the Democrats who passed it and not President Barack Obama himself. The thinly-veiled implication–a repeated theme in leftist critiques–is that Christians are hypocrites who care about personal salvation but not about good works.,1
779,"Some Americans could see their insurance bills double next year as the health care overhaul law expands coverage to millions of people.The nation's big health insurers say they expect premiums — or the cost for insurance coverage — to rise from 20 to 100 percent for millions of people due to changes that will occur when key provisions of the Affordable Care Act roll out in January 2014.Mark Bertolini CEO of Aetna Inc. one of the nation's largest insurers calls the price hikes ""premium rate shock.""""We've done all the math we've shared it with all the regulators we've shared it with all the people in Washington that need to see it and I think it's a big concern"" Bertolini said during the company's annual meeting with investors in December.To be sure there will be no across-the-board rate hikes for everyone and there's no reliable national data on how many people could see increases. But the biggest price hikes are expected to hit a group that represents a relatively small slice of the insured population. That includes some of the roughly 14 million people who buy their own insurance as opposed to being covered under employer-sponsored plans and to a lesser extent some employees of smaller companies.The price increases are a downside of President Barack Obama's health care law which is expected to expand coverage to nearly 30 million uninsured people. The massive law calls for a number of changes that could cause premiums for people who don't have coverage through a big employer to rise next year — at a time when health care costs already are expected to grow by 5 percent or more:— Changes to how insurers set premiums according to age and gender could cause some premiums to rise as much as 50 percent according to America's Health Insurance Plans or AHIP an industry trade group that's funded by insurers.— A new tax on premiums could raise prices as much as 2.3 percent in 2014 and more in subsequent years according to a study commissioned by AHIP. Policyholders with plans that end in 2014 probably have already seen an impact from this.Story continues— Requirements that insurance plans in many cases cover more health care or pay a greater share of a patient's bill than they do now also could add to premiums depending on the extent of a person's current coverage according AHIP.The Obama administration says the law balances added costs in several ways including tax credits that will bring down what many consumers will pay for insurance.""The health care law will bring down costs and save money for young people and families"" said Erin Shields Britt a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services. ""It's misleading to look at one provision of the law alone. Taken together the law will reduce costs.""WHERE 'RATE SHOCK' MAY STRIKEThe impact of some cost hikes will be wide ranging. The new premium tax for instance will affect individual insurance some employer-sponsored coverage and Medicare Advantage policies which are privately-run versions of the government's Medicare program for the elderly and disabled.Other price hikes will vary due to factors like a person's current coverage and age. Young people who currently have low-cost coverage may see some of the biggest hikes.In many states insurers charge a 60-year-old customer $5 in premiums for every $1 they collect from a 24-year-old. The logic behind that is that older people use health care more and generate more expensive claims than younger customers so insurers need to collect more to help pay their bills.But the overhaul will narrow that ratio to 3-to-1. That alone could cause the premium for a 24-year-old who pays $1200 annually to jump to $1800 according to AHIP. Meanwhile the 60-year-old who currently pays $6000 will see a 10 percent drop in price.Gender also can be a factor in whether premiums go up or down. The law will prohibit insurers from setting different rates based on gender — something they currently do because women generally use more health care. That means premiums for some men could rise while they fall for women.Prices also may change depending on a person's current coverage. Many policies on the individual market (coverage not sold through employers) exclude maternity coverage but that will be considered an essential health benefit under the overhaul. That could mean higher prices for some.Vikki Swanson 49 of Newport Beach Calif. resents that the added benefit may lead to higher costs for her. ""I had a hysterectomy I have no need for maternity coverage but I have to now pay for it"" she said.As a self-employed accountant and financial analyst Swanson has paid for her insurance coverage on the individual market for about 13 years. She watched her monthly premium climb from around $136 in 2001 to more than $600 before she could find cheaper coverage. She's frustrated that the overhaul may add to her bill.""I have to pay not only my own premium but I have to subsidize everybody else"" she said.CUSHIONING THE BLOWWhile insurers forecast instant premiums hikes starting next January the overhaul also is expected to tame health care costs for many.Starting next year the law will require insurers to cover everyone who applies. That means health care costs could fall dramatically for people who have been unable to find coverage due to a chronic condition like diabetes or high blood pressure.There also will be tax credits or subsidies given to people with incomes that fall within 400 percent of the federal poverty level. For 2013 400 percent of the poverty level for all states except Alaska and Hawaii would be $94200. These credits won't lower premiums but they can ease the insurance bill depending on a person's income.The credits should help the 20-something customers that insurers warn will see big premium hikes said Linda Blumberg an economist with the Health Policy Center of the Urban Institute a nonpartisan policy research organization. She noted that people in that age range are more likely to be either working for an employer that doesn't offer coverage or earning low wages that would entitle them to a sizeable credit.""While these folks are potentially facing some premium increases due to all these reforms they also are the ones most likely to get the financial help from the exchanges"" she said.There are other changes that will benefit young and poor people. Some may qualify for coverage under the state-federal Medicaid program for the poor and disabled which will expand in many states next year.Additionally people under age 30 who face big premium hikes will be able to buy plans that charge low premiums and just provide coverage for big or catastrophic costs. Those plans also will be available to people required to pay more than 8 percent of their income for coverage.Plus people who are age 26 and under are eligible to receive coverage under a parent's plan thanks to another overhaul provision that already started.In addition to those changes insurers will have to compete for business on the exchanges which could restrain price hikes said Larry Levitt a private health insurance expert with the Kaiser Family Foundation which analyzes health policy issues. He noted for instance that some are already creating narrow networks of low-cost providers to help keep costs in check.""Plans are very focused on trying to get these premiums down"" he said.But Robert Laszewski an industry consultant and former insurance executive said that theory assumes there is no competition in the marketplace now. He noted that a small company may get quotes from as many as 10 insurers competing for business when it tries to find coverage through a broker.""I haven't had one person in the industry remark to me 'Gosh I wonder what the other guy's charging'"" he said. ""They're worried that all this stuff is so expensive they're not going to get the pricing right.""",1
780,WASHINGTON -- President Obama can’t yet claim to have turned a corner but he does seem to have stopped a politically damaging slide in public approval for himself and his new healthcare law new polling data indicate.After seven months of steady decline public approval of Obama’s job performance has ticked upward according to a new Pew Research Center survey. The poll finds 45% of Americans approve of Obama’s work and 49% disapprove.That’s the highest approval and closest margin since mid-summer when the president’s ratings first turned negative. Obama’s low point came last month as the administration struggled to fix the HealthCare.gov website and placate Americans who had discovered contrary to his promise that their insurance policies were being canceled.The problems of the last year – including the stalemate or defeat of major legislation on gun control and immigration the standoff over the budget and the bungled rollout of the Affordable Care Act – have all taken a toll on how the public sees Obama. The percentage of those who say he is “not able to get things done” has risen steadily from a little more than one-third in the spring to just over half in the latest survey which was conducted Tuesday through Sunday for USA Today.AdvertisementBut several factors continue to buoy the president most notably the deep unpopularity of his opponents.Only 21% of those surveyed said they approve of the job Republican leaders in Congress are doing with 72% disapproving. Those numbers are essentially unchanged from the low point the GOP hit during the government shutdown in October.Feelings about the Republican Party as a whole are also negative with 35% having a favorable view and 59% an unfavorable one.By contrast the public divides almost evenly on the Democratic Party 47% to 48%. Their view of congressional Democratic leaders is better than their view of the GOP but still worse than their feelings about the president – 34% approve and 58% disapprove.AdvertisementAmericans divide sharply when asked if they have confidence in Obama on healthcare policy with 50% saying they have a “great deal” or “some” confidence and 48% saying they have “little” or none. But their view of the GOP on that issue is much more one-sided with only 32% expressing even “some” confidence and 66% having little or none.Obama also can continue to draw on positive feelings the public has about him. His ratings on several key attributes although lower than they have been during much of his presidency remain positive. For example just over half of Americans view Obama as “trustworthy” down from roughly 6 in 10 during most of his presidency. That’s the lowest rating of Obama’s presidency but still positive.Similarly 58% say Obama “cares about people like me” – a number that is down just slightly from the level he has seen during most of his tenure.More than 3 out of 4 say he “stands up for what he believes in.”AdvertisementIn addition to doubting his ability to get things done however the public divides evenly on Obama’s leadership skills. Half of Americans see him as a strong leader compared with 48% who do not.As has consistently been true since the healthcare law passed a majority of Americans disapprove of it with just over half in the current survey disapproving of Obamacare. But those numbers are no worse than they were in September before the law’s problem-plagued introduction.And the percentage who say that elected officials who oppose the law should do what they can to make it fail rather than try to fix it has gone down. Just 1 in 5 Americans takes that view. Among self-identified Republicans however 40% say elected officials should try to make the law fail. And among Republicans who identify with the tea party 60% want lawmakers to do what they can to make the law fail.Among self-identified Democrats and independents majorities either approve of the law or want lawmakers to find ways to make it work as well as possible.AdvertisementAsked to assess several reasons that might have played a role in the healthcare law’s problems a majority of Americans said each one had played a major role: poor management by the administration flaws in the law the complexity of the health insurance system and opposition from politicians who tried to undermine it.Democrats and Republicans both cited the complexity of the health insurance system as a reason for the law’s problems. But a predictable partisan divide surfaced on the three other reasons with nearly three-quarters of self-identified Democrats citing sabotage by opposition lawmakers as a major reason while 8 in 10 Republicans cited mismanagement and flaws in the law.The percentage of people who say the law has had a negative effect on the country has gone up but the percentage who expect it to continue to be a negative in the future has declined. Americans are now closely divided on their expectations of the law’s future impact with 39% saying they expect it will be mostly positive and 45% expecting mostly negative.The slow but steady improvement of the economy may have helped Obama. The percentage of Americans rating their personal financial situation as “poor” -- 19% -- is the lowest since before the economic crash in 2008. One in 4 says his or her personal conditions are “fair” or “good.”AdvertisementJust under half of Americans say they have a “great deal” or a “fair amount” of confidence that Obama will “do the right thing” on the economy. By contrast just over one-third feel that way about Republican leaders in Congress.Americans divide almost evenly on the question of whether Obama’s presidency so far has been a success (46%) or a failure (48%). That number closely mirrors the ratings that President George W. Bush received at roughly this point in his presidency. In Bush’s case the public’s view of his presidency continued to sour throughout his second term. Whether Obama can steady his presidency at its current level or rebound remains to be seen.The survey was based on telephone interviews with 2001 American adults. The margin of error for the full sample is plus or minus 2.6 percentage points.Follow Politics Now on Twitter and FacebookAdvertisementdavid.lauter@latimes.comTwitter @DavidLauter,1
781,"8 years ago(CNN) - While some Republican senators are calling for Congress to defund Obamacare altogether Sen. Susan Collins of Maine used the GOP weekly address Saturday to call for an adjustment in the health care law not a rejection of the law in its entirety.Collins takes issue with the Affordable Care Act's characterization of a full-time employee as someone who works 30 hours a week.The president's health care reform which was passed by Congress in 2010 and upheld by the Supreme Court last year will require businesses that employ at least 50 full-time workers to provide health insurance or face a penalty starting in 2015. The provision was originally supposed to kick in next year but the administration delayed it to give employers more time to prepare for the change.Collins said the 30-hour mark for ""full-time"" employees will ""only cause some businesses to reluctantly reduce the hours of their workers to fewer than 30 hours per week.""She gave an example of a school system in Maine that is already ""preparing to track and cap the number of hours that substitute teachers can work to ensure that they don't work more than 29 hours a week.""""Fewer hours means less money in the teachers' paychecks and more disruption for their students"" she added.She introduced a bill ""Forty Hours is Full Time Act"" in April that seeks to modify the federal definition of a full-time employee.""Of course fixing this one flaw won't solve the countless problems caused by Obamacare. But it would help ensure that millions of American workers do not have their hours and their paychecks reduced"" she said.White House Press Secretary Jay Carney argued in a press briefing last month that there is no data to indicate businesses are not hiring full-time employees because of the 30-hour mark.""I would say broadly that if you look at the economic data the suggestion that the ACA is reducing full-time employment is belied by the facts"" he said.Read a transcript of the senator’s full remarks below:",1
782,"The Obama administration on Friday appeared to rule out giving unions a special deal to offer their workers extra ObamaCare subsidies but left the door open to other changes after a private White House meeting with labor leaders who are concerned over the law.Earlier in the day AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka had urged the White House to act within a week to address labor unions’ concerns over ObamaCare.The sit-down with President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden came amid concerns from Republicans that Obama might be preparing to offer the unions a special deal to assuage their concerns.But on Friday night the White House said the Treasury Department had issued a letter ""making clear that it does not see a legal way for individuals in multi-employer group health plans to receive individual market tax credits as well as the favorable tax treatment associated with employer-provided health insurance at the same time.""However the White House did not specify exactly what it might do instead if anything. It said only it would work with various plans to create ""new high-quality affordable options"" for everyone.Later spokesmen for ranking House member Orrin Hatch of Utah and Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp of Michigan issued a joint statement saying“There has been far too much special treatment for politically-favored friends of ObamaCare. But when it comes to employers and taxpayers picking up the health care tab for labor unions – it appears that is a price that is simply too high.""Perhaps even this Administration recognizes that there are limits to them stretching the law to reward their friends.”The AFL-CIO just passed a resolution blasting ObamaCare as “highly disruptive” and the administration has been trying to convince the unions to lower the volume on their complaints about the law’s implementation.The Republican National Committee asked Friday whether the president would “cave” to the unions.Trumka was coy after emerging from the meeting with Obama and Biden.He called the meeting a ""problem-solving session"" but declined to specify exactly what type of fixes were discussed.“We’re going to try to get it done in the next week” he said. Asked if that meant a new regulation or Congress-approved law he said: “A solution.”The meeting comes days after the AFL-CIO approved a resolution warning the law would drive up the cost of union-sponsored health plans and encourage some employers to drop coverage.Unions want members to be eligible for the same federal subsidies available to low-income workers in the new health exchanges. The White House has resisted that remedy saying the law doesn't allow it.Capitol Hill Republicans though are now pursuing legislation that would prevent the administration from offering extra subsidies to union workers.Sen. John Thune R-S.D. on Monday introduced the ""Union Bailout Prevention Act"" which would stop the granting of subsidies to offset premium costs for the multi-employer plans held by many union members. Separately the House voted on Thursday to stop all subsidies until the administration launches a system to verify recipients are eligible.Unions argue that workers without additional subsidies will switch to less-expensive major-insurer plans creating a withering effect on the so-called Taft-Hartley plans.Thune and others argue the plans are already government-subsidized and the workers’ contributions are already tax-exempt.“A deal such as this by the administration for the union would be illegal” Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch and Michigan Rep. Dave Camp said in a letter Tuesday to the Treasury Department. “Giving union workers exchange subsidies in addition to the income-tax exclusion would be double dipping.”The Associated Press contributed to this report",1
783,Under the Gang of 8’s backroom immigration deal with Senators Schumer Corker and Hoeven formerly illegal immigrants who are amnestied will be eligible to work but will not be eligible for ObamaCare. Employers who would be required to pay as much as a $3000 penalty for most employees who receive an ObamaCare healthcare “exchange” subsidy would not have to pay the penalty if they hire amnestied immigrants.Consequently employers would have a significant incentive to hire or retain amnestied immigrants rather than current citizens including those who have recently achieved citizenship via the current naturalization process.The issue is really an “interaction effect” of the immigration proposal and ObamaCare itself.Beginning in January businesses with 50 or more full-time employees that do not currently offer healthcare benefits that are considered “acceptable” by the Obama administration must pay a penalty if at least one of their workers obtains insurance on a new government-run “exchange.” The penalty can be as much as $3000 per employee.Many employers have been preparing to cope with the new regulations by slashing the hours of full-timers to part-time status. Since “full-time” in the language of ObamaCare is averaging 30 hours per week employers will in general receive the penalty if they have 50 or more employees who are working an average of 30 hours per week.If the immigration bill becomes law many employers could receive incentives of hundreds of thousands of dollars to hire amnestied immigrants over American citizens. In addition these newly legalized immigrants could work “full-time” an advantage for companies and businesses as well while employers could lay off or diminish to “part-time” status American workers.Philip Klein of the Washington Examiner explains that he spoke with Alex Conant of Sen. Marco Rubio’s staff in April about the wrinkle and was told that this was an issue that could be addressed during the legislative process.“[T]he scenario you raise illustrates both the absurdity of ObamaCare and why we have insisted on a lengthy process to review this legislation before any votes are taken” Conant emailed Klein. “We always expected there might be a need for amendments to fix technical problems and we’ll be interested in seeing what sort of amendments might be offered to improve this part of the legislation without giving ObamaCare to illegals- something Sen. Rubio has always said he will not support.”However as Klein said a couple of weeks ago the issue has not been addressed and in fact the Schumer-Corker-Hoeven deal carries out what appears to be a major complication for American workers. Klein said that Conant did not respond to further requests for comment on this issue.As for Conant’s comment in April about Rubio insisting on a “lengthy process to review this legislation before votes are taken” that seems to have gone with the wind as well.,1
784,One Guatemalan father in Kansas has called a hotline every night to find out where HHS is holding his two daughters. After weeks he still has no answer.,1
785,But even if the chances of success are small the more the White House presses the issue the more it isolates the ideologues from the pragmatists and the more it separates the right wing from business donors.As Paul Taylor who follows immigration for Pew Research puts it: “It’s better politics if the president wins but it’s still good politics if he loses.”Rebalance foreign policy.For years the administration has talked of “rebalancing” our military strategy to address an increasingly assertive China. The Pentagon liberated from Iraq and drawing down in Afghanistan has taken some modest steps in this direction deploying more of the Navy to Asia devoting more resources to China’s space and cyber threats. But our rivalry with China is not and should never be primarily military. We need to compete on the fields of economics and diplomacy. Unfortunately the civilian custodians of our foreign policy have been bogged down in the Middle East a region that matters a lot but not as much as it did when we were more dependent on imported oil.In the Middle East Obama is now pretty much where he wants to be — jaw-jaw not war-war as Churchill liked to say — and that is clearly where the American people prefer him to be. Talks (hopeful) are underway to rid Syria of chemical weapons and (less hopeful) to find a diplomatic end to that country’s civil war. There is fitful progress in the talks aimed at testing whether Iran’s new president has the will and the authority to put a verifiable lid on that country’s nuclear program. Talks are taking place on the eternal conundrum of Israel’s coexistence with the Palestinians. Success at any of those tables would be a blessing to humanity and a great lift for the president.But while diplomats are patiently tending these negotiations there is time to pay attention to unfinished Asia business. The biggest item awaiting some Washington juice is the Trans-Pacific Partnership an immense stalled Asian free-trade agreement that would do more to counter burgeoning China than any number of battleships.Like most free-trade agreements it has opposition from critics who fear it would insufficiently protect labor consumers the environment and intellectual property. It’s time for the administration to cut some deals crack some heads and open up those Asian markets.Forget the Grand Bargain. Go for little bargains.The idea of a grand fiscal bargain — a megadeal that wins bipartisan support on the whole complex of spending taxes and entitlements — was all the rage a year ago but it has passed its sell-by date. Not only has it proven politically unattainable as long as the House is in thrall to a band of least-government ideologues it has also been overtaken by reality. Even relatively conservative economists concede that the deficit — a very sustainable 4 percent of gross domestic product — is not the problem at least not in the foreseeable future. There is a distant problem for Social Security and Medicare as my baby-boom generation retires and it would be nice to address it before young Americans find the cupboard bare. But the immediate and urgent problems are sluggish growth and too few jobs.,0
786,Last week House Republicans voted for the 40th time to repeal Obamacare. Like the previous 39 votes this action will have no effect whatsoever. But it was a stand-in for what Republicans really want to do: repeal reality and the laws of arithmetic in particular. The sad truth is that the modern G.O.P. is lost in fantasy unable to participate in actual governing.Just to be clear I’m not talking about policy substance. I may believe that Republicans have their priorities all wrong but that’s not the issue here. Instead I’m talking about their apparent inability to accept very basic reality constraints like the fact that you can’t cut overall spending without cutting spending on particular programs or the fact that voting to repeal legislation doesn’t change the law when the other party controls the Senate and the White House.Am I exaggerating? Consider what went down in Congress last week.First House leaders had to cancel planned voting on a transportation bill because not enough representatives were willing to vote for the bill’s steep spending cuts. Now just a few months ago House Republicans approved an extreme austerity budget mandating severe overall cuts in federal spending — and each specific bill will have to involve large cuts in order to meet that target. But it turned out that a significant number of representatives while willing to vote for huge spending cuts as long as there weren’t any specifics balked at the details. Don’t cut you don’t cut me cut that fellow behind the tree.Then House leaders announced plans to hold a vote on doubling the amount of cuts from the food stamp program — a demand that is likely to sink the already struggling effort to agree with the Senate on a farm bill.,0
787,WASHINGTON — House Republicans united Wednesday around a plan to use the threat of a government shutdown as leverage to repeal President Obama’s healthcare law confident the American people are on their side.House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) yielded to his right flank by agreeing to attach the healthcare law repeal to a must-pass bill to keep the government funded past Sept. 30. A vote is expected Friday on a bill that would allow the government to stay open for the next few months.AdvertisementThe measure is all but certain to pass the Republican-led House but faces rejection in the Senate where the Democratic majority has shown little interest in undoing Obama’s signature domestic achievement.Without a resolution by Oct. 1 the start of the new federal fiscal year the government will run out of money to keep federal workers on the job and provide basic services.AdvertisementBoehner and his leadership team had tried to avoid a prolonged battle over government funding but the speaker saw no other option after the most conservative House members revolted last week.“Every member in this room is for defunding Obamacare” Boehner told his colleagues in a private meeting in the Capitol basement according to a source in the room. “We’re going to send it over to the Senate so our conservative allies over there can continue the fight.”AdvertisementTop Republicans worry the party will be blamed if government services are interrupted much the way the party suffered during the last shutdowns in the mid-1990s. They were hoping to hold off the fight over repealing the healthcare law until next month when Obama may be forced to bargain in exchange for the administration’s request to raise the debt limit to borrow money to avoid defaulting on the nation’s bills.But many rank-and-file Republicans believe stopping the healthcare law is their constituents’ top priority.Advertisement“We’re doing what the American people are asking us to do” said third-term Rep. Marlin Stutzman (R-Ind.). “I think now is the time. You take the best opportunity that you have.”Rep. Tom Graves (R-Ga.) among those leading the fight said “I think over the next 12 days there’s going to be a strong argument from the American people saying this is the path forward.”AdvertisementPolls show more Americans oppose the law the Affordable Care Act than support it even as the online health insurance marketplaces are set to open Oct. 1. Obama on Wednesday asked the Business Roundtable an organization of top business leaders to use its influence to encourage lawmakers to “not promise apocalypse every three months.”“I think this is the time for us to say once and for all we can’t afford these kinds of plays” Obama said. “I know the American people are tired of it. I’m tired of it and I suspect you’re tired of it too.”AdvertisementA similar message was sent to Capitol Hill from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce which warned that it was “not in the best interest of the U.S. business community or the American people to risk even a brief government shutdown.”The fight to keep the government running is the first in series of choke points this fall that Republicans intend to use to pressure Obama since they have failed repeatedly to stop the healthcare law.AdvertisementBy mid-October Congress will be asked to raise the debt limit and Republican leaders are gearing up to demand a one-year delay of the healthcare law as part of any deal with the White House. The funding bill if approved would keep the government open through Dec. 15.How Congress will handle the Sept. 30 deadline for a government funding resolution remains an open question.AdvertisementSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) will probably ask Democrats to strip the healthcare law repeal from the resolution but Republicans in the Senate will be under enormous pressure to prevent that.Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) a potential presidential contender who has been a vocal opponent of the healthcare law and other conservative senators are being urged by their House colleagues to mount a round-the-clock filibuster if needed to thwart Democrats.AdvertisementThe senator however did not appear to promise heroics as he acknowledged Reid probably had enough votes. But Cruz’s spokesman said “all options remain on the table.”Intensifying the threat of a shutdown Boehner does not appear to have a backup plan if the Senate sends the funding bill back to the House without the healthcare law repeal.AdvertisementMany House Republicans appear unprepared for that scenario which could unfold late next week. Others such as Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.) insisted they would not vote for a bill that did not kill the healthcare law.“This is the line in the sand” he said.AdvertisementBoehner may need to rely on Democrats to help pass the bill which he has been increasingly reluctant to do because it could threaten his already shaky hold over his Republican majority.lisa.mascaro@latimes.comAdvertisementChristi Parsons in the Washington bureau contributed to this report.,1

789,Now what should be done? On Monday President Obama both criticized and defended the Web site. While he conveyed an all-hands-on-deck attitude and his commitment to solving the problems he did not give sufficient specifics.But there are five things we can do now to right the ship of Obamacare.The president should create a new position: an independent chief executive of the federal exchange. On Tuesday the White House announced that the economic adviser Jeffrey D. Zients will oversee the “tech surge” in the short term. Mr. Zients is a great manager and was a health care industry consultant but he is also about to take on an important job as director of the National Economic Council. We need someone who can not just begin the repair process but also run and refine the exchange’s operations for at least the next two years.This C.E.O. should meet one on one with the president every week to ensure he or she has full authority to carry out the job. The candidate should have management experience knowledge of how both the government and health insurance industry work and at least some familiarity with IT systems. Obviously this is a tall order but there are such people. And the administration needs to hire one immediately while Mr. Zients works to put out the fires.Second the system needs to borrow from other exchanges. While the federal exchange has been a fiasco many state exchanges have been working well since they launched earlier this month. One of the assignments for the students in my health policy class at the University of Pennsylvania this semester was to window-shop for insurance policies on the California exchange. They found the site easy to use and said there were many choices and the prices were competitive even before subsidies. These students are the key demographic — young and healthy — that the sites need if they are going to succeed. Mr. Zients and the new C.E.O. should be looking carefully at the California Kentucky Massachusetts Maryland New York and any other successful state-run exchanges and seeing which aspects can be adopted into the federal exchange without reinventing it wholesale.Next the administration needs to be candid with the public. Given the disappointing rollout of the Web site Americans are justifiably suspicious. Starting now the administration needs to initiate a concerted effort to win back the public’s trust. There should be twice-weekly briefings that feature honest and complete descriptions of both the problems and solutions that the tech team is working on — in all the gory detail. We need to hear from those “best and brightest” experts whom President Obama has enlisted in the tech surge. Transparency is the only way to convince the American people that the situation is under control.,1
790,Mr. Obama has been adamant that he will not link any other budget issues to the debt ceiling increase while Congressional Republicans are demanding he compromise with them to raise the ceiling. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said Wednesday in a letter to Speaker John A. Boehner that the debt limit would be reached “no later than” Oct. 17.While Mr. Obama’s ratings sag he can take some solace in the standing of the Republican opposition in Congress. Nearly three-quarters of Americans disapprove of Congressional Republicans. More of the public supports Mr. Obama than Republicans to make the right decisions on the deficit health care and the economy.“I would blame the Republicans for a shutdown” said Barbara Nemeth 70 an independent in Port Richey Fla. “It’s not their job to stalemate the government. It’s their job to work cooperatively and compromise. That has been traditionally the American democratic way. They are acting like a bunch of overgrown spoiled brats.”But there is little doubt that the president is being hurt by questions over his health overhaul. Only one in five Americans say they expect to be positively affected by the law.The survey also suggests that Republicans could pay a political price going into next year’s midterm elections if there is a government shutdown. Eight in 10 Americans find it unacceptable for either the president or members of Congress to shut down the government to achieve their goals during budget negotiations. And while half the country sees Mr. Obama as working with Republicans only one in four Americans see Congressional Republicans as working with the president to get things done.A plurality say they would blame Congressional Republicans if a shutdown occurred.“It’s bad on both sides” said Gerald Muller 86 an independent from Austin Tex. “President Obama is not checking with experts. He’s a man who has been working alone and he’s isolated himself and now he has no one to turn to or he won’t turn to them. He has a lot of learning to do in my opinion. And the Republicans have their own agenda. They are kind of stubborn and don’t seem willing to compromise.”,1
791,Wednesday night House Leadership withdrew legislation to fund the government through December in response to growing conservative criticism that the measure didn’t strip funding for ObamaCare. Congress must pass legislation to authorize continued government spending before September 30 or the government will shut down. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor had unveiled a plan that would split the ObamaCare funding from the underlying government spending but conservatives balked at the plan. Any action on spending now has been pushed to next week.Conservatives led by Sens. Ted Cruz and Mike Lee have argued that any measure to extend government spending authority should also include language to defund ObamaCare. On October 1 the health care exchanges authorized by ObamaCare where individuals can presumably shop for health insurance are set to open. On January 1 all Americans are mandated to have health insurance. On that date as well large subsidies and tax credits to supplement those insurance premiums will begin. Unless the law is uprooted now it will likely remain.Cantor’s plan envisioned the House passing a “clean” resolution to continue government spending one which absorbed the sequester cuts. It also would include a separate resolution that defunded all aspects of ObamaCare. Under Cantor’s plan the Senate would receive the “clean” resolution until it had voted on funding ObamaCare. The Senate would have to definitively vote on funding ObamaCare before it could vote to keep the government open.Conservatives rebelled arguing that the split resolutions offered nothing more than a symbolic vote against ObamaCare and removed all leverage against the unpopular law. Democrats in control of the Senate could vote down the ObamaCare defunding and then quickly authorize legislation to keep the government functioning.The issue is however far more complicated. Funding ObamaCare requires about $13 billion in annual appropriations that is subject to Congressional authorization. More than $70 billion a year however is funded by mandatory spending that isn’t subject to Congressional authorization. In other words Congress could eliminate all spending for ObamaCare but 70% of the program would march on.That said everything in life is done on the margins. Eliminating just a fraction of the overall spending on ObamaCare could upend the whole program. That is the hope of conservatives. And that hope cause GOP Leadership to blink.,0
792,Responding to an email Drew Altman the president and C.E.O. of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation wrote of the A.C.A.:“I think the bottom line here is that the ‘winners’ greatly outnumber the ‘losers’ in general and in the individual market in Obamacare but the media and political math is different from the actual math. A significant minority of ‘losers’ or self-perceived losers and a few high profile bad outcomes (possibly NH) are more than enough to cause real political problems.”According to Robert J. Blendon a professor at Harvard’s School of Public Health the New Hampshire type of problem is more endemic:“This is the next big political story. The president promised people they could keep their doctor and implicitly their hospital. A number of state exchanges are like New Hampshire in that they are offering what are called narrow network plans. Some of these plans exclude coverage at children’s hospitals as well which means some parents with sick children will have to change their source of care. This too is not what was promised.”In the state of Washington the Seattle Children’s Hospital was initially left off the list of approved care providers by five of the seven insurers operating in Kings County through the state exchange Healthplanfinder. The hospital was forced to sue state officials in order to gain eligibility.Obama and his party's elected officials not only have the elections of 2014 and 2016 to worry about but also the future prospects of the liberal agenda writ large which had appeared to be slowly gaining momentum before the Obamacare portal snafu.The degree of political damage inflicted so far is reflected in this RealClearPolitics graph (Figure 1) of voter responses to the question: “If the election for the U.S. House of Representatives were being held today would you vote for the Republican candidate or for the Democratic candidate in your district?”The graph shows a collapse in Democratic voting intention. In effect all the gains Democrats made during the period Republicans shut down the government and demanded an end to Obamacare have been lost since Obamacare was actually launched.More granular analysis of Democratic losses in recent weeks can be found by comparing two Quinnipiac polls the first released on Oct. 1 2013 when Democrats had a nine point 43-34 advantage on the generic voting question; and the second released on Nov. 13 when the Democratic lead was erased and the parties were tied at 39-39.The biggest drops were among self-identified independents who went from slightly favoring Democrats 32-30 to decisively Republican 37-26; men an 11-point shift; voters making less than $50000 11 points; and young voters 18-29 who showed the largest shift of all 24 points. The dropoff among lower income and young voters strikes at the heart of the Obama coalition. Voters 65 and over who had backed Republicans by large margins in 2010 but who favored Democrats 43-37 in the October poll were back in the Republican fold 41-38 by November.“The redistributive arithmetic of Obamacare’s architecture could never add up” Steven Hayward a visiting scholar in conservative thought and policy at the University of Colorado wrote in Forbes magazine: “The wonder is that Obama’s political team didn’t see this coming and prepare a pre-emptive strategy for dealing with the inevitable exposure of the duplicity at the heart of Obamacare’s logic.”,1
793,President Barack Obama was signed up for largely symbolic health insurance coverage over the weekend the White House said Monday. He chose one of the cheapest plans “as a show of support” for the millions of Americans his administration is trying to steer towards the new online exchanges.All presidents and their immediate families get coverage through the military. As Commander-in-Chief any president has a personal physician and he and his family get full care at the White House Medical Unit and the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda Md.Obama didn’t wait until the last possible minute a White House official says. Monday’s the last day to enroll on the federal exchange and on most of the state exchanges as well as Washington D.C.’s exchange.“Over the weekend and in advance of today's deadline the president enrolled in a health care plan made available by the Affordable Care Act on the D.C. marketplace” the official said.Obama who is on vacation in Hawaii had a staffer do the heavy lifting for him a White House official says. He had to be enrolled in person in no small part because his personal information is not readily available in the variety of government databases HealthCare.gov uses to verify identities.“The act of the president signing up for insurance coverage through the DC exchange is symbolic since the president's health care will continue to be provided by the military” the official added.“But he was pleased to participate in a plan as a show of support for these marketplaces which are providing quality affordable health care options to more than a million people. The president selected a bronze plan.” Bronze plans have the lowest premiums and tend to have higher deductlbles.Obama doesn’t qualify for a federal subsidy to help pay premiums both because of his income and because he is already covered.,0
794,"Doctor Walker is ready for you.Doctor Walker is ready for you.Scott Walkers #1 #2 and #3 top concerns have always been the same: Scott Walker.In elected office nearly his entire adult life he has used each office he's held exclusively as a stepping stone to his next elected office. Well known for rewarding donors and continually inflicting as much damage as possible as possible on those he identifies as enemies Walker has amassed a zealous following among the most ideological Republican voters by resorting to the most petty politics imaginable.Sitting in the Wisconsin State Legislature he leapt on the opportunity to become Milwaukee County Executive in a recall election (yes you read that right) when residents of Milwaukee County became angry at a pension deal that mainly benefitted the County Exec and several long-serving members of the Board of Supervisors. RW hate radio and the Republican-loving Milwaukee corporate media fanned the flames and paved the way for Walker. The rest is history. Walker won the recall.As Milwaukee County Executive Walker began to travel the state (at county taxpayer expense of course) to increase his name recognition. His next office naturally would be state-wide since he was already at the top of the heap in the Milwaukee area. He cut taxes for business pummeled Milwaukee County labor unions squeezed public services to near extinction shifted money out of building maintenance privatized as many jobs as he could (ultimately costing the county millions in lawsuits) was relentless in reducing social programs and made use of his Milwaukee County staff and facilities for political purposes including the installation and use of a secret router and private email accounts to circumvent public records laws.In short he didn't manage his public duties as much as use elected office for politicking for his next job. Poor bashing union bashing and dog whistle blowing are very attractive to Republican voters and tossing in a blind hatred of taxes appeals to far too many independents and low information voters.The governors seat was hardly even warm from the heat of his butt when he unveiled the most horrific legislation possible. Taking nearly a billion dollars out of public schools slashing state shared revenue to local governments virtually abolishing unions for every public employee in the entire state whose union didn't endorse him in the election slashing programs for the disabled extreme reductions in state public assistance and health programs along with of course massive tax reductions (to business) led tens of thousands of normally politically sleepy Wisconsinites to surround the State Capitol for weeks.He knew something would happen so he made sure to activate the Wisconsin National Guard. His attempt to use them as his palace guard or goon squad fell flat due to the good leadership of the Guard. I doubt he imagined the full extent of public pushback at his extremism. No doubt he and his staff had to order super sized containers of Poop-B-Gone to get the stains out of their underwear that first week but Walker just loved the attention of the media as could be seen at his 2-3 pressers he held every day.He became a national Republican Super Star and loved every minute of it. I'm surprised he could control the drool of anticipation at his next political office. Forget running for Herb Kohls Senate seat; he was becoming popular enough to run for President! He knew exactly how to lure extremist Republican primary voters and doubled down on the crazy laws he signed into office no matter how many times the courts smacked down those laws as Unconstitutional.Campaign donors loved him and funneled plenty of payola into his coffers to enable him to put out tons of ads during the protests to promote his ""concerns for the taxpayer"" and bash protesters. A hundred million dollars flowed into his hands through the end of the recall election and that doesn't even count the ads run by Koch-funded groups like Americans for (the Koch Brothers) Prosperity and similar astroturfs.Republicans love Scott Walker.",0
795,"Americans who buy their own health insurance next year won't have to get coverage through their state-based exchange.Many insurers will offer individual policies outside the Obamacare exchanges in 2014. Consumers can avoid the exchanges by buying plans directly from insurers or through brokers.But should they?First anyone earning less than 400% of the poverty line will be eligible for federal subsidies toward exchange-based plans so going off the exchange would likely not make sense.But those who make too much to qualify for subsidies should look both on and off the exchanges for a plan that best fits their needs experts say.The off-exchange policies are required to have many of the same Obamacare protections as plans sold on the exchanges like maternity and mental health benefits plus insurers can't exclude enrollees because of pre-existing conditions. Only a handful of current individual policies that meet strict guidelines will be grandfathered in.So why might one want to go off the exchange?#1: Possible better coverage: Some insurers may opt to offer richer policies or continue grandfathered plans off the exchange to hold onto long-time customers. These policies may have more comprehensive doctors' networks or lower drug co-pays ... with a higher premium to boot said Dan Mendelson chief executive of Avalere Health an advisory company for insurers. But they could be more attractive to current customers than the exchange policies which may be more restrictive in order to keep premiums under control.Share your story: Will you just pay the Obamacare penalty?But some insurers intend to sell the same plans -- with the same premiums -- both on and off the exchange. Those companies are betting on other advantages to make their plans attractive.#2: Less paperwork: The off-exchange policies may also attract enrollees who won't want the additional work of going through the exchange which involves gathering pay stubs or W2 forms settling up an account and waiting for income and citizenship status to be verified by federal agencies.""You don't necessarily need to go through the extra steps of applying for an exchange policy if you are not subsidy eligible"" said Bruce Allen marketing director at Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina which is selling policies both on and off the exchange there. ""We can get you enrolled in minutes.""#3: Less government involvement: Some consumers have also told Blue Cross that they intend to go off the exchange because they don't want anything to do with Obamacare either because they oppose it politically or they equate it with government assistance programs such as Medicaid.Related: I'm signing up for ObamacareBut shopping off the exchange has its challenges. One thing that will be tougher for consumers opting to buy insurance off the exchange is comparing plans and premiums. The exchanges will have websites where consumers can browse through the various plans being offered. But policies available outside the exchange will be sold primarily through independent agents or insurance companies which could make it harder for consumers to weigh their options.""Compared to the exchanges the off-the-exchange market for consumers will continue to be the Wild West in regards to shopping and comparing benefits and prices"" said Kevin Lucia senior research fellow at Georgetown's Center on Health Insurance Reforms.",0

797,Sen. Ted Cruz's (R-Tex.) marathon speech modeled on an old-fashioned filibuster against Obamacare touches on green eggs and ham Ashton Kutcher poker and several other topics. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)Sen. Ted Cruz's (R-Tex.) marathon speech modeled on an old-fashioned filibuster against Obamacare touches on green eggs and ham Ashton Kutcher poker and several other topics. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) escalated his conflict with fellow Republicans Tuesday when he stepped up his attacks on President Obama’s health-care law complicating House GOP efforts to pass a funding bill that would avert a government shutdown next week.Launching a marathon speech modeled on old-fashioned filibusters Cruz also informed his Senate GOP colleagues that he would try to stretch the debate well into the weekend according to senators who attended private huddles Tuesday. With Senate passage all but certain including funds for the health law senior Republicans had hoped to allow the measure to advance quickly to give House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) more time to respond with a different version of the legislation.Instead the freshman senator took the floor Tuesday afternoon promising to speak “until I am no longer able to stand.” His effort to block the legislation had almost no chance of success as the series of votes advancing it are locked in and most of his fellow Republicans have abandoned him in the effort.The Cruz talkathon was the latest example of the increasingly stark division among Republicans both on Capitol Hill and nationally. The Texas newcomer just 42 and nine months into office is carrying the banner for conservatives urging a take-no-prisoners approach in confronting the president even if it means shuttering the government.“A great many Texans a great many Americans feel they do not have a voice and so I hope to play some very small role in providing the voice” Cruz declared.As Sen. Ted Cruz's marathon speech against Obamacare modeled on an old-fashioned filibuster goes late into the night he takes a moment to read his kids some bedtime stories. (The Washington Post)But the move angered senior Republicans who complained that Cruz and the junior senators pushing this strategy did not understand the wounds the GOP suffered during the mid-1990s shutdown battles with President Bill Clinton. Back then the party controlled both the House and Senate a luxury when compared to its tenuous majority in the House today.“I just don’t believe anybody benefits from shutting the government down and certainly Republicans don’t. We learned that in 1995” said Sen. Orrin Hatch (Utah) the dean of the GOP caucus. “We’re in the minority. We have to find a way of standing up for our principles without immolating ourselves in front of everybody in a way when we don’t have the votes to do it.”Some suggested that this was the latest example of a party adrift both on policy and strategic thinking. “We haven’t had much of a strategy on anything to this point. Everybody’s shooting from the hip” said Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.).Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) originally preferred a different approach that would have required Democrats to vote for the health-care funds while GOP senators could have symbolically opposed.Cruz played a leading role along with outside conservative groups in pushing House Republicans to take a harder line. House Republicans relented and on Friday passed a bill exactly as Cruz wanted.“We don’t need fake fights. We don’t need fake votes. We need real change. We need a better economy. We need more jobs” Cruz said early Tuesday afternoon rejecting the original Boehner-McConnell plan.Throughout the afternoon and evening a half-dozen colleagues joined Cruz on the floor among them Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) two 2016 presidential aspirants. Cruz could yield to colleagues for long-form questions but could not leave the floor or sit.In the opening hours Cruz discussed an unusual mix of subjects ranging from opposition to the health-care law; the unemployment rate among African American teenagers; how his father Rafael Cruz used to make green eggs and ham for breakfast; a recent acceptance speech by actor Ashton Kutcher at an awards show; and the restaurants Denny’s Benihana and White Castle.Later in the evening Cruz read Twitter messages he was receiving from supporters and “bedtime stories” to his two young daughters who he said were in Texas watching with his wife. He quoted from “King Solomon’s Wise Words” from the Book of Proverbs and read the Dr. Seuss classic “Green Eggs and Ham” noting that it was one of his favorite children’s books.When he yielded briefly to take questions the other senators would give extended remarks on their opposition to the health-care law and then ask Cruz questions that set up the Texas senator to continue his remarks.By holding the floor Cruz and his allies launched what looked to most Americans like a traditional filibuster fixed in the popular imagination by Jimmy Stewart’s performance in “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.”But even if Cruz were physically capable of speaking for more than 24 hours — the longest filibuster in U.S. history is 24 hours 18 minutes by Sen. Strom Thurmond (S.C.) and other Southern senators opposed to civil rights laws — there are parliamentary procedures in place dictating that Cruz will have to yield the floor by Wednesday afternoon at the latest.At that point the Senate is scheduled to hold a key procedural test vote that is near certain to pass with bipartisan support. McConnell had hoped that he could get Cruz and his band of allies to relent so that the Senate could pass something by Friday. He even convened an extra meeting in addition to the weekly Tuesday policy luncheon at which several senators said Cruz was encouraged to drop some of his delaying tactics or Boehner would not get the legislation until late Sunday or early Monday.Cruz told the group that he would use every tool possible to drag out the vote.“My own view is that it would be to the advantage of our colleagues in the House who are in the majority to shorten the process and if the majority leader were to ask us to shorten the process I would not object” McConnell told reporters after the two meetings.“If the House doesn’t get what we send over there until Monday they’re in a pretty tough spot” McConnell said later. “My own view is the House having passed a bill that I really like and that I support . . . I hate to put them in a tough spot.”If Cruz holds firm Boehner will have just hours to decide his next move. He might try to quickly pass a new version of the funding legislation with some conservative sweeteners but Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) warned that such a move done just hours before Monday’s stroke-of-midnight deadline would guarantee a federal government shutdown. There would simply not be enough time to get through the Senate’s messy parliamentary hurdles to avoid at least a temporary shutdown.Cruz who began speaking at 2:41 p.m. was quickly joined by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) who was the original architect of the strategy to defund Obama’s health-care law or shut down the government. Their filibuster is the culmination of a strategy they began developing in the summer when Lee first elected in 2010 started looking for allies to defund the law by using annual spending bills for federal agencies as potential leverage.Lee and Cruz launched a commercial campaign that targeted fellow Republicans with ads designed to pressure GOP senators to support the pair’s shutdown strategy. Senior colleagues have rejected the approach and instead have grown more angry.,1
798,Back to previous pageCruz ends anti-Obamacare talkathon after 21 hoursSen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) ended his marathon talking attack on President Obama’s health-care law Wednesday after 21 hours and 19 minutes — a feat of stamina that seems likely to complicate House GOP efforts to pass a funding bill aimed at averting a looming government shutdown.The freshman senator ceded the floor — and got his first opportunity for a bathroom break — at noon after running up against a deadline imposed by Senate procedural rules. A little over an hour later the Senate voted to choke off the first filibuster hurdle on its own version of the funding bill which is the first step toward allowing Democrats to include funding for the health-care law that had previously been stripped out by the House.Both houses of Congress must reach agreement on funding legislation by Monday night to avoid most federal agencies closing on Tuesday.( Read a transcript of Cruz’s remarks on Tuesday. )Meanwhile a similarly contentious debate is simmering over raising the federal debt ceiling with Treasury Secretary Jack Lew warning Wednesday that the nation will exhaust its emergency borrowing capacity no later than Oct. 17.Despite urging from some of his colleagues not to stage the talkathon Cruz took the floor Tuesday afternoon promising to speak against the health-care law “until I am no longer able to stand.”To most Americans it looked like a traditional filibuster fixed in the popular imagination by Jimmy Stewart’s performance in “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.” But parliamentary procedures already in place meant that Cruz eventually would have to yield the floor.Cruz’s controversial strategy shrank the window available for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) and his colleagues to respond with a different version of the legislation.(INTERACTIVE: Longest filibusters of all time )By 5 a.m. the length of Cruz’s marathon discourse had surpassed lengthy filibusters by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) in March and the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) in 1964. He earned a lead spot on all three network morning news shows acknowledging that he was “a little bit” tired but still looking remarkably fresh. The television anchors dubbed Cruz’s effort a “talkathon” even as they explained to viewers that his effort would not derail the legislative process.The senator still wearing the dark suit and light blue tie he had donned the previous day kept his composure throughout his marathon presentation.The Cruz talkathon was the latest example of the increasingly stark division among Republicans both on Capitol Hill and nationally. The Texas newcomer just 42 and nine months into his first term in office is carrying the banner for conservatives who urge a take-no-prisoners approach in confronting the president even if it means shuttering the government.But the move angered senior Republicans who complained that Cruz and the other junior senators pushing this strategy did not understand the wounds the GOP suffered during the mid-1990s shutdown battles with President Bill Clinton.

We don’t need fake votes. We need real change. We need a better economy. We need more jobs” Cruz said early Tuesday afternoon rejecting the original Boehner-McConnell plan.All through the night and well into the morning Cruz’s oratory touched on a broad mix of subjects and sources including lyrics from a song by country music star Toby Keith; quotations from the popular reality television show “Duck Dynasty;” recollections of how his father Rafael Cruz used to make green eggs and ham for breakfast; and a recent acceptance speech by actor Ashton Kutcher at an awards show.At one point Tuesday night Cruz opted to read bedtime stories to his two young daughters who he said were home in Texas watching television with his wife. Cruz first read King Solomon’s Wise Words from the Book of Proverbs and then the Dr. Seuss classic “Green Eggs and Ham” which he said was one of his favorite children’s books.Several times Cruz read supportive messages sent to his office via Twitter.Cruz was permitted to yield to colleagues for long-form questions but could not leave the floor or sit while his effort was under way.Several like-minded Senate conservatives took turns giving him respite Tuesday evening including Paul and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) two 2016 presidential aspirants. Rubio returned to the Senate floor Wednesday morning along with Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.).Cruz’s most frequent partner has been Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) who at times phrased “questions” that stretched for almost an hour and included detailed critiques of Supreme Court decisions and a series of recollections from his younger years all designed to draw attention to his concerns about the health-care law.The extended discourse by Cruz and Lee is the culmination of a strategy they began developing in the summer when Lee first elected in 2010 started looking for allies to defund the health-care law by using annual spending bills for federal agencies as potential leverage.Lee and Cruz launched a commercial campaign that targeted fellow Republicans with ads designed to pressure GOP senators to support the pair’s shutdown strategy. Senior colleagues have rejected the approach and instead have grown more angry.A series of junior Democratic senators presided over the Senate chamber through the night as Cruz talked on and on and on. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) passed the time scanning her iPad. Reporters spotted Sen. Chris Murphy (Conn.) returning to the U.S. Capitol shortly before 11 p.m. with a Red Bull in hand.“There’s no point to this other than advancing the career of one or two senators” Murphy said as he wrapped up his two-hour shift around 1 a.m.As dawn neared Cruz began leaning more on the podium at his desk which was surrounded by binders and stacks of paper.

799,Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer gives a thumbs-up to hundreds of supporters as she touts her Medicaid expansion plan during a May 15 rally at the Arizona Capitol in Phoenix. (Ross D. Franklin/Associated Press)Republican fissures over the expansion of Medicaid a critical piece of the 2010 health-care law designed to provide coverage to millions of uninsured Americans continue to deepen with battles in Arizona and elsewhere showing just how bitter the divisions have become.Despite expressing distaste for the new law some GOP governors have endorsed an expansion of Medicaid and three — Jan Brewer of Arizona John Kasich of Ohio and Rick Snyder of Michigan — are trying to persuade their Republican-controlled legislatures to go along. The governors are unwilling to turn down Washington’s offer to spend millions if not billions in their states to add people to the state-federal program for the poor. But they face staunch opposition from many GOP legislators who oppose the health-care law and worry that their states will be stuck with the cost of adding Medicaid recipients.In one of the most explosive of the internal Republican battles Brewer a firebrand tea party favorite who once wagged her finger at President Obama has declared a “moratorium” on all other legislation until her Medicaid plan which would add 300000 Arizonans to the program is approved. She has backed up her threat by vetoing five unrelated bills.In Ohio and Michigan the governors are pressing for last-minute compromises before their legislatures adjourn this summer. The Florida legislature which has adjourned rejected Republican Gov. Rick Scott’s plan to expand Medicaid.These conflicts over the health-care law illustrate a larger divide within the Republican Party over an array of issues including immigration and automatic budget cuts.The Medicaid expansion is one of the two main ways the health-care law would provide coverage to the uninsured. The other is through health insurance exchanges which will sell policies to individuals whose incomes are too high for Medicaid; many of those people will receive subsidies to buy the health plans.Medicaid eligibility varies from state to state and depends on income and other factors. The health-care law in an effort to make eligibility uniform mandated that anyone earning up to 138 percent of the poverty level or $15856 in 2013 dollars be eligible for the program. But last June the Supreme Court while upholding most of the health-care law ruled that states could refuse to expand their Medicaid programs. That set the stage for bitter debates — ones ruled as much by ideology and politics as by financial realities — that have been occurring in state capitals nationwide.Under the law the federal government will pay 100 percent of the cost of newly eligible Medicaid recipients for the first three years beginning in January. After that the federal contribution will taper leveling off at 90 percent for 2020 and beyond.Twenty-three states and the District have agreed to the Medicaid expansion. Nineteen states have decided against the expansion and eight are debating it according to Avalere Health a consulting firm. States that decline to expand Medicaid now can still sign up in later years.The debate over Medicaid has been emotional and vitriolic in many states. In Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) was heckled during a recent speech for opposing an expansion. In Montana chaos erupted after a lawmaker accidentally voted against expanding the program causing the measure to fail. Medicaid advocates in some states frustrated by inaction from their elected leaders are working to put the matter to voters in the form of ballot initiatives.The hostility is evident in Arizona where authorities are investigating a threatening phone call and e-mails directed at lawmakers who support expanding the program. Opponents of the expansion have condemned the alleged threats.Brewer’s support for the expansion has stunned longtime backers who have come to relish her gritty confrontational persona. These supporters were gleeful last year when photos showed her defiantly pointing a finger at the president on a tarmac in Phoenix during what she later described as a tense conversation about her characterization of Obama in her memoir “Scorpions for Breakfast.”Now her former fans label her a traitor and deride her Medicaid proposal as “Obrewercare.”“It’s typical of these politicians” said Dara Vanesian chairman for the Navajo County Republican Committee. “This is not truly about the individual or rights or what’s best for Arizona. This is Brewer looking at dollars that are supposedly going to come from the federal government.”Brewer may win despite the opposition. Her measure has passed the Republican-controlled state Senate. There is stronger opposition in the House which has a larger and more conservative Republican majority. State Rep. John Kavanagh (R) chairman of the House Appropriations Committee said the committee plans to strip the Medicaid expansion from the budget.He acknowledged that his members are feeling the heat after Brewer’s vetoes. Still he added conservative lawmakers would be hard-pressed to vote yes on the Medicaid expansion after years of railing against the health-care law and federal spending.“For the last five years almost every one of us Republicans have been bashing Obamacare and vilifying the federal government for irresponsible government spending” Kavanagh said. “I have never seen a more toxic vote for Republicans than to vote yes on this expansion.”Matthew Benson a spokesman for Brewer said the governor is confident that the Medicaid proposal will ultimately pass the House. Despite the vocal opposition from within her party he said she has the support of many traditionally conservative groups including 14 of the state’s 15 sheriffs and the Arizona Chamber of Commerce.“We recognize that the ‘Obamacare’ title is what makes this controversial” Benson said. “If it weren’t for that aspect of it this plan would have gotten done months ago.”Brewer who joined the unsuccessful lawsuit last year to strike down the health-care law has tried to walk a blurry line on the issue. She has maintained her opposition to the legislation and insisted that her Medicaid proposal is not the same as Obama’s.Her office has argued that the Medicaid plan will spur growth by providing money to hospitals and pumping $2 billion into the Arizona economy. And she has said she will pull the plug if it appears that the federal government will not come through on its promise to fully or mostly fund the expansion.“When I introduced my Medicaid restoration plan in January I knew it wasn’t going to be easy” Brewer said at a rally in Tucson. “I knew the road was going to be tough. And I knew there were going to be opponents. But let me tell you something else. I don’t think the opponents realize how hard we are going to fight.”Arizona was the last state to join Medicaid signing on in 1982 17 years after the program was created. Today it covers many childless adults who earn up to $11490 the federal poverty level for that demographic and a more generous amount than most states.,1
800,"President Obama in a heavily partisan speech defending his signature health care law claimed Thursday ""there's no widespread evidence"" it is hurting jobs -- despite widespread reports that businesses are cutting back worker hours in order to avoid extra costs tied to the law.The charge that ObamaCare is driving Americans into part-time work is one of the central claims that opponents make in arguing for the law to be defunded or delayed. Sen. Ted Cruz R-Texas reiterated the claim during his 21-hour floor speech against ObamaCare this week.But the president while promoting the law to a friendly audience in suburban Washington brushed off the argument.""Most of the stories you'll hear about how ObamaCare just can't work they're just not based on fact"" Obama said.He continued: ""They said this would be a disaster in terms of jobs. There's no widespread evidence that the Affordable Care Act is hurting jobs. ... Reforming health care's going to help the economy over the long-term.""More On This...The claim flies in the face of what union leaders have been telling the White House and Democratic lawmakers for months.In a widely noted letter to Democratic leaders over the summer the heads of the Teamsters and other unions argued that ""perverse incentives"" were hurting jobs.Unless the law is changed they wrote ""the ACA will shatter not only our hard-earned health benefits but destroy the foundation of the 40-hour workweek that is the backbone of the American middle-class.""They and employers across the country point to provisions of the law that would require businesses with 50 or more full-time workers to provide health insurance to those workers. The argument is that businesses are scrambling then to make more workers qualify as part-time by reducing their hours to fewer than 30 a week.""Numerous employers have begun to cut workers' hours to avoid this obligation and many of them are doing so openly"" the union leaders wrote.The Obama administration in a surprise move delayed the employer mandate by a year. But that hasn't stopped businesses from cutting hours.Investor's Business Daily has compiled a list of more than 300 employers that have cut worker hours or staffing levels many as recently as this month.Among them was SeaWorld in Florida cutting back part-time hours from 32 to 28 per week.The Washington Free Beacon reported Wednesday on a South Carolina cleaning business claiming it will hire only part-time workers in order to stay under the 50-worker threshold.Obama was promoting the law in Maryland in advance of the Oct. 1 launch of the so-called insurance ""exchanges."" These are regulated marketplaces where Americans will be able to shop for approved insurance plans -- enrollment begins Tuesday.Obama tried to counter ""misinformation"" about the law and noted: ""If you already have health care you don't have to do anything.""",1
801,"next Image 1 of 2prev Image 2 of 2Millions of health insurance plans have been cancelled after ObamaCare went into effect and President Obama backed away Monday from his previous oft-repeated statement that “if you like your plan you can keep your plan.”But he may want to glance at his own website WhiteHouse.gov which still states: ""For Americans with insurance coverage who like what they have they can keep it. Nothing in this act or anywhere in the bill forces anyone to change the insurance they have period.""That appears in a section of the WhiteHouse.gov website labeled ""health reform details."" The exact same language also appears in the Department of Health and Human Services' online description of the law.But that web description is very different from what Obama said Monday to top backers of Organizing for Action his permanent campaign arm.“What we said was ‘You could keep it [your plan] if it hasn’t changed since the law was passed’” Obama said.Critics say the conflicting language is dishonest.More On This...“Even though millions of Americans are getting cancellation notices in the mail because of the President’s health care law the White House website still promises that Americans can keep the care they like"" Senator John Barrasso R-Wyo. who is also an orthopedic surgeon said in a statement to FoxNews.com.""If the President was being honest he would finally tell the American people that his law won’t allow them to keep their coverage premiums won’t be cheaper than a cell phone bill and the website won’t be as easy to use as Amazon. It’s time for the White House to tell the truth – instead of doubling down on dishonesty” Barrasso added.A Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman said on Monday that she would check on the issue but did not comment as of Tuesday.White House spokesman Eric Schultz reached by FoxNews.com did not say whether the administration stood by the website's wording but he instead referred to statements by spokesman Jay Carney from Tuesday.Carney in his remarks Tuesday defended all the President’s statements.""Look the [grandfathering] provision within the Affordable Care Act was the manifestation of the President’s promise that if you had a plan that you liked you could keep it” Carney said before putting the blame on insurers.""If you had a plan and your insurance company didn’t cancel it you could keep it"" Carney said.However the insurance company cancellations were largely due to a rule issued by the Department of Health and Human services which disqualified plans that have changed at all since the law passed from being “grandfathered” in and exempted from the regulations.“When the rule was issued Secretary Sebelius and others spoke to the press about it specifically about the fact that… if insurance companies changed their plans or canceled their plans they would give up the opportunity to grandfather those plans in” Carney said.Yet critics point out that the website reads: “Nothing in this act or anywhere in the bill forces anyone to change the insurance they have period.”A Republican Senate health policy staffer told FoxNews.com he thought the wording on the website was inaccurate and surprising.""It does surprise me because the Obama team owes their success in no small part to social media and web savvy. And they know that any narrative is subject to a quick check via Google.""The staffer added ""the President's defenders will say he was just trying to simplify a complicated public policy into terms that people can understand... But I think there's a difference between trying to simplify things and fundamentally changing the meaning.""Most Americans are happy with their existing plans he noted.""Polls have repeatedly shown that 85% of Americans who have coverage are satisfied with it"" he said. Two Quinnipiac polls from 2009 before ObamaCare passed put the number at between 85 and 88%.Some in Congress say they're trying to do something to help people keep their plans.""Millions of Americans are slated to lose the individual health insurance they already like and own"" Re. Thomas Massie R-Ky. told FoxNews.com.""I recently joined Congressman Ron DeSantis to introduce the 'If You Like Your Health Care Plan You Can Keep It Act of 2013' to make good on the President’s promise"" he added.Asked on Tuesday whether such a plan would be considered by the President Jay Carney did not answer directly.Asked whether the President would take back his ""if you like your health plan you can keep it"" comments from the past if he could Carney replied:""Well the President as awesomely powerful as the office is can't go back in time.

802,As he tried to reframe the national discussion about healthcare reform on Wednesday President Obama uttered an outright fib: “This debate has never been about right or left” he said of the ceaseless fighting over his healthcare plan.Oh yes it has. And is.Faced with a blizzard of bad PR as a result of a faltering website that had been designed as the main portal for those seeking insurance under the plan Obama went to Boston to park himself in the place where Republicans and Democrats passed a state health program that served as a model for the national one.His intent was multi-pronged: By location he sent the reminder that in places where all parties worked to pass and improve healthcare reform the program has succeeded. (And he pointed out that was accomplished under a Republican governor Mitt Romney the man he defeated in 2012). By topic he accented the popular aspects of healthcare reform as if to remind people that there was a reason that politicians have tried to pull off insurance reform for decades.AdvertisementBut in trying to re-argue the case for a program passed several years ago — and not sold well in the interim — Obama faces an intractable question: Is anyone listening?Recent polling shows that views of healthcare reform have frozen in place and along partisan lines.According to a survey taken by the Pew Research Center in mid-October about 4 in 10 Americans approved of the healthcare law and 5 in 10 disapproved.But among Democrats 75% approved. Among Republicans 85% disapproved. And their views have apparently hardened; apart from a slight increase in disapproval among Republicans hardly any group changed their tune from a September Pew poll.AdvertisementRepublicans have noted time and again that the national plan was passed by Democrats against GOP objections making it different at the outset from the bipartisan Massachusetts measure. Nonetheless the president’s remarks Wednesday appeared intended to reach over the squabbling right-left divide to reassure Americans that what was passed wasn’t as life-altering as its opponents have made it out to be and in fact had some popular components.“A true patients’ bill of rights” he called it. “No more discrimination against kids with preexisting conditions. No more dropping your policy when you get sick and need it most. No more lifetime limits or restricted annual limits. Most plans now have to cover free preventive care like mammograms and birth control. Young people can stay on their parents’ plans until they are 26. All this is in place right now. It is working right now.”He implored those who are uninsured and want to sign up for coverage or those whose existing insurance is being replaced to have patience as the kinks are worked out of the system. He repeatedly said that he was confident those groups would find affordable plans -- once they can gain access to the system that is.He also nodded to the blast of criticism from people whose bargain-basement plans have been canceled because they did not comport with the new minimum coverage requirements for health insurance. He called the insurers who had sold those plans “bad apple” insurers. And he altered his often-uttered statement as the law was proposed and since that Americans who were happy with their insurance could keep it. Now what you can keep he said is “health insurance that works” as defined by the law.Advertisement“If you’re getting one of these letters just shop around in the new marketplace” he said. “That’s what it’s there for.... You’re going to get a better deal.”The danger in Obama’s remarks nearly a full month after the rocky debut of the insurance marketplaces that were supposed to benefit the most needy is that they came after a considerable chunk of the country has either gone to their partisan corners or thrown their hands up in frustration or disgust. A calm rendering of the facts as he saw them might have at least minimized some of the partisan tension but Obama did not pass up the opportunity to dig at the other side.He spoke of governors including some Republican executives who have worked to put the healthcare law into place and chastised those who had worked to block it.“Some are so locked into politics that they won’t lift a finger to help their own people” he said with an edge of bitterness. “If they put as much energy into making it work as they do to attacking the law Americans would be better off.”AdvertisementAnd he said anyone defending the broken system that the law was meant to replace “should have to explain themselves ... because I don’t think we should go back to discriminating against kids with preexisting conditions. I don’t think we should go back to dropping people because they get sick or they make a mistake on their application.”Selling the healthcare law has always been a stiff challenge in some ways giving rise to the same fears that are summoned by discussions about changing Social Security and Medicare. People are always worried that they will lose what they have imperfect as it is. When putting a plan in place whose most visible beneficiaries are people in the minority — the uninsured and the uninsurable — squawks are predictable.At this point however Obama alone owns Obamacare for better or worse.cathleen.decker@latimes.comTwitter: @cathleendecker,0
803,Though the Obama administration said that individuals making under $45960 would get Obamacare subsidies low-income young people in most of America’s big cities who relied on that promise are discovering they will be ineligible for them.According to a CNN report though young people are now required to purchase insurance under Obamacare or pay a fine “many low-income younger Americans won’t get any subsidy at all” because as the Obama administration claims the “cost of insurance is lower than the government initially expected.”In April Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius “told a congressional subcommittee that any individual making under that $45960 threshold–or four times the poverty level of $11490 for an individual–would qualify for ‘an upfront tax subsidy.'”According to CNN “subsidies are based on a formula set by law applying to individuals with annual incomes of one to four times the poverty level–or $11490 to $45960.” And to calculate the subsidies “the government sets a maximum amount that low-income customers will have to pay for insurance as a percentage of their income. That cap is then subtracted from the cost of a mid-level insurance plan in the individual’s region and the difference is their subsidy.”And though insurance companies are required to “knock that amount off the price of premiums before the customer pays” the subsidy is “zero” if the baseline plan insurance plans are cheap enough. That means many low-income younger Americans who are forced to buy insurance are discovering to the surprise of many that they will have to do so without the subsidies they were promised as CNN noted:,1
804,Throughout the Obama administration our dangerously incurious acquiescent media have been collectively caught off guard by every White House scandal from Benghazi to the IRS to “you can keep your insurance.” Each and every time the media ignored conservatives who warned in advance of what was happening. But the next unexploded scandal — a nuclear bomb in ObamaCare — is an opportunity for the media to redeem itself.Thursday Forbes reported that the Obama administration knew in 2010 that by the time the dust settles 93 million Americans will lose their insurance due to ObamaCare. This time instead of being caught off guard and surprised by something that is an open secret maybe the media can get ahead of this story before it is too late — if it isn’t already:Section 1251 of the Affordable Care Act contains what’s called a “grandfather” provision that in theory allows people to keep their existing plans if they like them. But subsequent regulations from the Obama administration interpreted that provision so narrowly as to prevent most plans from gaining this protection.“The Departments’ mid-range estimate is that 66 percent of small employer plans and 45 percent of large employer plans will relinquish their grandfather status by the end of 2013” wrote the administration on page 34552 of the Register. All in all more than half of employer-sponsored plans will lose their “grandfather status” and get canceled. According to the Congressional Budget Office 156 million Americans–more than half the population–was covered by employer-sponsored insurance in 2013.Another 25 million people according to the CBO have “nongroup and other” forms of insurance; that is to say they participate in the market for individually-purchased insurance. In this market the administration projected that “40 to 67 percent” of individually-purchased plans would lose their Obamacare-sanctioned “grandfather status” and get canceled solely due to the fact that there is a high turnover of participants and insurance arrangements in this market. (Plans purchased after March 23 2010 do not benefit from the “grandfather” clause.) The real turnover rate would be higher because plans can lose their grandfather status for a number of other reasons.How many people are exposed to these problems? 60 percent of Americans have private-sector health insurance–precisely the number that Jay Carney dismissed. As to the number of people facing cancellations 51 percent of the employer-based market plus 53.5 percent of the non-group market (the middle of the administration’s range) amounts to 93 million Americans.Dear Media: This is science math and law. How about digging in a little bit on this one? Because it is coming and we all know it.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC,1
805,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Faced with a trio of controversies President Barack Obama is trying to halt a perception spreading among both White House opponents and allies that he has been passive and disengaged as unexpected developments consume his second term.The new strategy underscored in a flurry of new White House actions signals an Obama team anxious to regain control amid controversies that have emboldened Republicans and threatened to plunge the president's second term into a steady stream of congressional investigations.On Wednesday Obama released a trove of documents related to the Benghazi attacks amid pressure from Republicans. He asked Congress to revive a media shield law that would protect journalists from having to reveal information a step seen as a response to the Justice Department's widely criticized subpoenas of phone records from reporters and editors at The Associated Press. And he forced the resignation of the top official at the Internal Revenue Service after the agency targeted conservative political groups.""Americans have a right to be angry about it and I am angry about it"" Obama said of the IRS actions. ""I will not tolerate this kind of behavior at any agency but especially at the IRS given the power that it has and the reach that it has into all of our lives.""The president seeking to have a more robust profile on the controversies also said he would take questions from reporters Thursday at a previously scheduled news conference with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. And Obama is expected to nominate a new acting IRS commissioner this week to replace Steven Miller who resigned Wednesday.The president addressed the IRS controversy on Monday but his measured words left many unsatisfied particularly given that he had waited three days to address the developments. He also repeatedly asserted that he was waiting to find out if the reports were accurate even though top IRS officials had already acknowledged the controversial actions.Story continuesAdding to the narrative of a passive president were White House efforts to distance Obama from the IRS scandal as well as revelations that the Justice Department had secretly obtained work and personal phone records of AP journalists. In both cases the White House insisted the president had no prior knowledge of the events and learned about the matters as the general public did — from news reports.Obama's cautious response combined with his lack of awareness about controversies brewing within his administration opened him to criticism from hisRepublican foes.""If Obama really learned about the latest IRS and AP secret subpoena scandals in the news who exactly is running the ship at the White House?"" Republican National Committee spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski said.But in a worrisome sign for the White House some Democrats also criticized the president for not being more aggressive in responding to trouble within the government.Robert Gibbs Obama's former White House press secretary said the president should have appointed a bipartisan commission of former IRS officials to look into the issue of targeting political organizations. And Gibbs gently chided his former boss for using passive language when he first addressed the political targeting during a White House news conference Monday.""I think they would have a much better way of talking about this story rather than simply kind of landing on the 'Well if this happened then we'll look at it'"" Gibbs said on MSNBC.The fresh pair of controversies coincided with a resurgence in the GOP-led investigation into the Sept. 11 2012 attacks on a U.S. compound in Benghazi Libya that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans.Congressional Republicans launched another round of hearings on the attacks last week. And on Friday a congressional official disclosed details of emails among administration officials that resulted in talking points used to publicly discuss the deadly incident being revised to downplay the prospect that the attacks were an act of terror.Obama aides insisted the emails were either taken out of context or provided no new information but they resisted pressure to make the emails public for five days before finally disclosing them to reporters Wednesday. The emails revealed that then-CIA Director David Petraeus disagreed with the final talking points despite the White House's insistence that the intelligence agency had final say over the statements.The White House has publicly defended its handling of the controversies. Obama spokesman Jay Carney has insisted it would be ""wholly inappropriate"" for the president in the case of the Justice Department matter to weigh in on an active investigation and in the case of the IRS controversy to insert himself in the actions of an independent agency.However legal scholar Jonathan Turley disputed those assertions saying there is no legal reason a president would be precluded from learning about the investigations before the public did or from commenting on them at least broadly.""These comments treat the president like he's the bubble boy"" said Turley a law professor at George Washington University.David Axelrod Obama's longtime adviser acknowledged the White House could have acted more aggressively in ""the interest of stagecraft."" But he insisted that the president's handling of the matters will ultimately be vindicated.""One virtue he has is that he takes a long-range view"" he said. ""It's easy to get whipped up by the frenzy but it's responsible to react to the facts. It has short-term liabilities but in the long-run it's a quality you want in a president.""___Follow Julie Pace on Twitter at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC",0

""I don't think anyone will leave.""Earlier Thursday EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said Yanukovych who had rejected the proposed deal in recent weeks ""made it clear to me that he intends to sign the association agreement.""The about-face from Yanukovych could help ease tensions after three weeks of protests and building occupations in the capital city of Kiev but experts and the protesters themselves said that in the wake of a violent crackdown that broadened the protesters' demands they are unlikely to immediately disperse.""People want to keep on building pressure definitely until the 17th of December"" said Orysia Lutsevych a non-resident fellow in the Russia and Eurasia program at the London-based Chatham House think-tank.Yanukovych is scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss a potential strategic partnership on that date Lutsevych said adding that protesters remaining out on the streets could deter Yanukovych from signing any kind of agreement with Russia.Protests have been taking place in Kiev's central Independence Square for weeks and in the past week violent clashes have erupted after large numbers of police and security forces tried to clear roadblocks and occupy buildings and the square itself.The protests were sparked by Yanukovych's surprising decision prompted by Russian pressure not to sign a far-reaching trade and cooperation pact with the European Union at a summit in late November in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius.The parties have a chance to get talks back on track but the frayed relationship between Ukraine and its would-be partners in the EU could hamper an agreement Lutsevych said.""The main story is that the EU as always says 'We are open' but they were also disgusted and I'm sure the trust is lowering every day"" she said. ""After Vilnius it was very low and now after all the violence they used overnight on the protesters … think about it.""Lutsevych said the violent crackdowns against the protest were ""a kind of tipping point.""The protesters ""saw that this government is not willing to listen to people and is trying to pretend it's business as usual"" she said. ""But it's not business as usual for them.""Zhuk echoed that sentiment.""At first it was indeed the protest for signing the association agreement with EU but after what happened — all the force used against protesters — only someone who is completely ignorant can say 'OK now everything will change to the best' and go home"" he said.Lutsevych said a pact with the EU would entail far more than an agreement from Yanukovych to pursue it.The status of former prime minister and opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko whose arrest in 2011 and ongoing incarceration for abuse of power which many in the EU establishment view as politicized sits atop the list of potential issues.""The EU agreement will not happen until Tymoshenko is released and all these things are done"" Lutsevych said. ""They may have a declaration of intention to do something but that's not enough.""She said she expected the EU to ask Ukraine to make certain changes to the electoral code and to the prosecutor's office. The Ukrainian government is trying to ""divert attention to only economic things.""On the streets Ukrainians overwhelmingly supported accession to the EU. There were a few dissenters.""The protesting students heard a fairy tale about Europe being a heaven about a visa-free regime and about secure life for elderly people"" said Anna Shyshkova who witnessed protests in the southern Ukrainian city of Simferopol.

807,"Susan Page USA TODAYAmericans overwhelmingly support universal background checks for gun buyersTwo-thirds back tracking gun sales%2C but there%27s a big partisan divide on the issue.Gun-rights supporters much more likely to place a priority on the issue.WASHINGTON — An ""activism gap"" between gun rights supporters and those who back stricter limits helps explain why gun control legislation has proved so difficult to enact even in the wake of public outrage over shooting rampages.A nationwide poll by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press finds Americans by 51%-45% say it's more important to control gun ownership than to protect the right of Americans to own guns.However those concerned about gun rights are much more likely to place a priority on the issue and be politically active about it. Nearly one in four have contributed to a group that takes a position on gun policy for instance compared with 5% of those who say it's more important to control guns. Gun rights advocates are nearly twice as likely to have contacted a public official to express an opinion about gun policy 15%-8%.The phone survey of 1502 adults taken Jan. 9-13 shows broad and bipartisan consensus in support of two particular proposals:Making background checks on gun buyers universal including at gun shows and in private sales is backed by 85% of Americans including about equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans.Preventing people with mental illness from buying guns is backed by 80% including 86% of Republicans and 78% of Democrats.Both ideas are supported by close to nine in 10 gun owners who made up about a third of those surveyed.On other proposals there are sharp partisan splits. Two-thirds endorse creating a federal database to track gun sales but Democrats are nearly twice as likely as Republicans to back the idea. A ban on assault-style weapons is supported by 84% of Democrats but 44% of Republicans.""My starting point is not to worry about the politics"" President Obama said at a news conference Monday when asked about gun control one month after 20 children and six educators were shot to death at an elementary school in Newtown Conn. ""My starting point is to focus on what makes sense what works what should we be doing to make sure that our children are safe and that we're reducing the incidence of gun violence.""He said ""If in fact — and I believe this is true — everybody across party lines was as deeply moved and saddened as I was by what happened in Newtown then we're going to have to vote based on what we think is best. We're going to have to come up with answers that set politics aside. And that's what I expect Congress to do.""What about the National Rifle Association's proposal to protect children by arming more adults in schools?By 2-1 64%-32% those surveyed support the idea of using more armed security guards and police officers. A solid majority 57%-40% oppose arming more teachers. On that issue the partisan divide is particularly stark: 56% of Republicans and 23% of Democrats say it's a good idea.On some issues involving guns men and women have different views. Two-thirds of women but fewer than half of men support an assault weapons ban. Nearly half of men but just a third of women endorse arming teachers with guns in schools.The poll's margin of error is +/-2.9 percentage points.",1
808,"Story highlights Top diplomatic economic officials from U.S. China meet in Washington D.C.Fifth annual U.S.-China Strategic Economic Dialogue now underwayCyber hacking theft of intellectual property tariff wars high on agendaAnalysts: U.S.-China mutually dependent cannot afford conflictThorny issues of unbalanced trade cyber security and intellectual property rights stand stark in the spotlight at this year's U.S.-China Strategic Economic Dialogue now underway in Washington D.C.Top officials from both sides including co-chairs U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and China's State Councilor Yang Jiechi have expressed tempered optimism for ""a new chapter"" in bilateral ties -- despite recent stumbles.The U.S. has slammed China on unfair subsidies on solar panels and the theft of secrets owned by U.S. technology companies. China has returned its own complaints -- most recently after NSA leak Edward Snowden alleged Washington has been hacking Chinese computers.Yet leaders of both the U.S. and China -- the world's two largest economies -- know their nations are mutually dependent especially on economy and foreign policy. Should either party try to distance itself from the other the result would be mutually detrimental analysts say.""For the United States the biggest issue is market access to China and making sure American companies have a level playing field"" says Fred Neumann HSBC Co-head of Asian Economics and Managing Director in Hong Kong.JUST WATCHED In China economics influences politics Replay More Videos ...

Washington slapped tariffs on Chinese-made panels in response to alleged subsidies by Beijing. Under the ruling Chinese panels were hit with tariffs from 2.9% to 4.7% echoing similar spats between China and Europe over solar panels and European winesThe biggest technological thorn in U.S.-China ties is ""the respect for intellectual property created by U.S. firms"" -- and lack thereof says Chris Bronk IT Policy Fellow at Rice University's James A. Baker Institute.This includes ""everything from pirated movies and software to R&D and corporate strategy documents"" because ""losses will cut into the capacity for additional development if the return on investment is insufficient.""In June the U.S. Department of Justice charged one of China's biggest wind turbine makers Sinovel with stealing source codes from a U.S. competitor and manufacturing new machines. American Superconductor Corporation claims Sinovel's theft resulted in $800 million in losses.The United States loses some $300 billion each year mostly because of Chinese intellectual property theft said former U.S. ambassador to China John Huntsman to CNN in June.In addition to IP theft U.S.-China cyber security issues have come to the fore in the past month after NSA leak Edward Snowden alleged U.S. intelligence agents have been hacking hundreds of Chinese computers since at least 2009.China claimed Snowden's revelations would ""test developing Sino-US ties"" and exacerbate an already ""soured relationship"" on cybersecurity. Snowden's assertions on top of alleged Chinese hacking of U.S. firms depict a clear degree of mutual mistrust. The majority of headlines in China since then have referenced ""strain"" ""tension"" and even ""anger"" between the U.S. and China.The potential and ease for cyber attacks between the U.S. and China will continue to grow says Andy Mok managing director of Beijing-based Red Pagoda and former technology researcher for RAND Corporation.""When every physical object has an IP address ... the return on malicious behavior becomes much higher. So on both sides -- China and the U.S. -- the targets are increasingly attractive.""National electrical grids and transportation networks are some of the most attractive marks in each country adds Mok.""That said the sky is not falling and I don't believe we are weeks or months away from a cyberwar with China that will leave the U.S. power grid in tatters and the whole country sitting in the dark for months or years.""The chances of direct conflict are low agree analysts. Economic military and technological disparity between the U.S. and China is too great. China is not ready for a clash to occur. And the U.S. -- still on the mend from the 2008 financial crisis -- is unlikely to instigate a conflict with China because of its own fiscal binds to China.Sentiment from top officials appeared to underline this. U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told CNN's Fareed Zakaria China's pace toward market-oriented reforms ""will probably be slower than we would like"" but expects reforms to clearly proceed.Chinese Vice-Premier Wang Yang penned a positive editorial in the Washington Post hoping the U.S. and China would ""forge a more cooperative relationship.He noted that 70% of U.S. companies operating in China made a profit in 2012 the 1500 McDonalds in China have outperformed outlets elsewhere in the world and a flight between the U.S. and China now takes off once every 24 minutes.",0
809,"next Image 1 of 2prev Image 2 of 2A Republican senator blasted the Pentagon after it entered into a new helicopter contract with a Russian company which is supplying the Syrian regime -- even as the U.S. moves to arm the Syrian opposition.The contract was announced Monday with Russian arms firm Rosoboronexport for military helicopters that will go to Afghan security forces. The Pentagon argues the helicopters are the only option but Sen. John Cornyn R-Texas is adamant that the U.S. find an alternative considering the company's ties to the Bashar Assad government in Syria.""American taxpayers should not be indirectly subsidizing the murder of Syrian civilians"" Sen. John Cornyn R-Texas said in a statement.Cornyn first challenged the Pentagon over a prior contract with Rosoboronexport last year and was able to successfully pass an amendment in November barring the use of funds for contracts with the company.But the latest contract used money from the fiscal 2012 budget which was approved before Cornyn's amendment.More On This...Cornyn said Tuesday that the Obama administration also could get around that amendment by arguing the contract was in the country's national security interests.""In other words: they want us to believe that we are promoting U.S. security by doing business with a Russian arms dealer that is helping an anti-American terror-sponsoring dictatorship commit mass atrocities"" he said.The $572 million contract announced Monday would purchase 30 Mi-17 helicopters for Afghan security forces which deals with counterterrorism and other missions. The contract also includes spare parts test equipment and engineering support services. The contract lasts through the end of 2014.The Pentagon has defended its arrangements with Rosoboronexport arguing that the Mi-17 helicopters are ""uniquely suited"" for Afghanistan.Spokeswoman Maureen Schumann said Wednesday the Russian government has notified the U.S. that Rosoboronexport is the ""sole legal exporter of Mi-17s for military use.""""The department explored whether there were any alternatives to contracting with Rosoboronexport to meet this requirement but none were identified"" she told FoxNews.com.Gen. Joseph Dunford commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan also said Tuesday that the Mi-17 is favored in part because of its ""simplicity.""""I can tell you having watched them very closely here over the last several months the Mi-17 is actually operating very well for the Afghans. It seems to be going through their operational construct and they seem to be using it very effectively both for casualty evacuation to move troops around the battlefield and in fact this week we've just equipped it with a weapons system so it's also now capable of providing some limited fire support"" he said.The contract comes as U.S. forces look to hand security responsibility in Afghanistan over to the Afghans.As for the company's work with Syria Russia's government has claimed the company's arms cannot be used against Syria's civilian population.""Weapons do not shoot all by themselves. It is people who shoot from them. Unlike its partners Russia has never tried to add oil to the fire"" a Russian official was quoted as saying last year.But Human Rights Watch claimed last year that Rosoboronexport nevertheless appears to be Syria's main weapons supplier questioning how the company tracks how its weapons are being used.The Pentagon contract comes at a vital time as the Obama administration steps up its support for the anti-Assad opposition by pledging to provide small arms to certain opposition groups. The contract potentially puts the U.S. government in the uncomfortable position of funding a company that is aiding the other side of that civil war.Despite Russia's claims a Pentagon official wrote a letter to Cornyn in March 2012 that acknowledged ""evidence"" that Rosoboronexport's arms ""are being used by Syrian forces against Syria's civilian population.""",1
810,President Barack Obama unveiled his “Power Africa” program on Sunday that will spent $7 billion in U.S. taxpayer money to fund a sub-Saharan Africa electricity program that will also develop geothermal hydro wind and solar power.The International Energy Agency says achieving universal electricity access to sub-Saharan Africa by 2030 would require $300 billion.Obama said his plan is meant to bring “light where there is currently darkness.”The Obama White House released a statement saying that the president’s Africa plan “will commit more than $7 billion in financial support over the next five years” including:The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) will provide $285 million in technical assistance grants and risk mitigation to advance private sector energy transactions and help governments adopt and implement the policy regulatory and other reforms necessary to attract private sector investment in the energy and power sectors. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) will commit up to $1.5 billion in financing and insurance to energy projects in sub-Saharan Africa. The U.S. Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im) will make available up to $5 billion in support of U.S. exports for the development of power projects across sub-Saharan Africa. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) will invest up to $1 billion in African power systems through its country compacts to increase access and the reliability and sustainability of electricity supply through investments in energy infrastructure policy and regulatory reforms and institutional capacity building. OPIC and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) will provide up to $20 million in project preparation feasibility and technical assistance grants to develop renewable energy projects. These efforts will be coordinated through the U.S. – Africa Clean Energy Finance Initiative (US-ACEF) and supported by the recently launched U.S. – Africa Clean Energy Development and Finance Center (CEDFC) in Johannesburg South Africa. The U.S. African Development Foundation (USADF) will launch a $2 million Off-Grid Energy Challenge to provide grants of up to $100000 to African-owned and operated enterprises to develop or expand the use of proven technologies for off-grid electricity benefitting rural and marginal populations. In 2014 OPIC and USAID will jointly host an African energy and infrastructure investment conference. The conference will bring investors developers and companies together with U.S. and African government officials to demonstrate the opportunities for investment and the tools and resources available from the U.S. government and other partners to support investment.Power Africa will also receive $9 billion from General Electric and other private companies.,0
