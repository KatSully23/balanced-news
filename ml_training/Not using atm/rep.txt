The acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of unarmed teen Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Fla., raised fresh discussion of "stand your ground" laws.The case centered around whether Zimmerman acted in self defense and drew national attention to Florida's law, which allows people to defend themselves with force if they feel threatened in their home, business, car, or a place where they "have a legal right to be." At least 22 states have a similar law, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.While Zimmerman did not ultimately use the "stand your ground" defense in his case, Sanford police did not arrest him until almost two months after the shooting because of the Florida stand your ground rules that require police to have specific evidence to refute a self defense claim in order to arrest someone claiming self defense.That provision of the law "does a disservice to Floridians because it's so vague," said Florida Sen. Dwight Bullard, a Democrat, in an interview Sunday with CBS Miami.The police initially did not have evidence to disprove Zimmerman's self-defense claim, said former Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee, Jr.It was not until the case drew national attention and a Department of Justice investigation that prosecutors found evidence to charge Zimmerman with second-degree murder. The NAACP Legal Defense Fund is urging Attorney General Eric Holder to undertake a review of the case and encouraging Trayvon Martin's family to pursue civil action against Zimmerman.Last year, a Florida task force headed by the lieutenant government reviewed the state's "stand your ground" law, but in a final report, the task force only made minor recommendations that required no action from the legislature. No changes were made to the law this year."The liberal activists tried to use that tragedy (the shooting death of Trayvon Martin) as an opportunity to take our rights as Americans," said Florida House Speaker Rep. Will Weatherford, a Republican, on the attempts to change the state's stand your ground law. "We stood our ground on Stand Your Ground."Across the country, at least 22 states have "stand your ground" laws, with varying degrees of requirements for when citizens may use deadly force to protect themselves. Before these new laws were put in place beginning in 2005, people who felt threatened outside their home were required to flee from an attacker before they were allowed to use force to defend themselves.The new laws make clear, however, that if someone feels threatened either inside or outside their home, they do not have to run away and are legally justified in using force to protect themselves."If (my family and I) are walking through the mall and someone attacks us, I should not have to retreat. I should be able to defend myself in any place or forum that I need to," said Florida Rep. Carlos Trujillo, a Republican, on Sunday in an interview with CBS Miami.Some states just allow people to defend themselves in their homes or businesses, while others extend the law to cars or any place someone "has a right to be." Florida's law falls into this second category. (See chart)The Zimmerman case drew national attention to the "stand you ground" laws, which were promoted by the National Rifle Association and the American Legislative Exchange Council through model legislation and advocacy.In a study of "stand your ground" laws commissioned by the National Bureau of Economic Research, researchers found that in states with "stand your ground" laws, the number of homicides had significantly increased from the years before the law was enacted. They found that the provision that allows self-defense "in any place a person has a legal right to be" is the driver of the increase in homicides. The increase in homicides, they argue, negates the claim that these laws reduce crime.Stateline is a nonpartisan, nonprofit news service of the Pew Charitable Trusts that provides daily reporting and analysis on trends in state policy.

The Supreme Court’s 5 to 4 decision to strike down a key part of the Defense of Marriage Act was undeniably historic, a victory not just for gay rights advocates but for anyone committed to advancing equal rights in America. It was also an anomaly. For all the celebration Wednesday — and who will forget the Gay Men’s Chorus of Washingtonsinging the national anthem outside the court? — the underlying theme of the Supreme Court’s term was not the recognition of rights, but their dilution. Time and again, in closely divided decisions on issues as disparate as antitrust law, privacy and discrimination, the court either watered down rights or made it difficult or impossible to enforce them effectively. (Unless, of course, you are a white college applicant challenging affirmative action.) In two cases, the justices made it impossible for plaintiffs alleging serious violations of federal law even to have their claims heard. In Clapper v. Amnesty International, the court denied a constitutional challenge to the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which vastly expanded the National Security Agency’s surveillance powers. This law authorizes the recently disclosed surveillance programs, which involve the interception of international e-mails, phone conversations and social-network communications. The act permits surveillance without having to show that the target is suspected of anything, thereby jettisoning the bedrock requirement of the Fourth Amendment. The plaintiffs in Clapper included lawyers, human rights advocates and journalists, all of whom communicated frequently with people overseas whom the government was likely to be targeting under the statute, and therefore had to take expensive and burdensome measures to preserve the confidentiality of their communications.  With a majority comprised of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Samuel A. Alito Jr., Anthony M. Kennedy, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, the Supreme Court ruled that the plaintiffs’ claims could not be heard because they could not show that they had actually been subjected to the surveillance. The catch: The surveillance is conducted in secret, so no one can be certain that he or she is subject to it.In a second case,  American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant , the same five justices ruled that corporations can insulate themselves from liability for violating federal law by inserting clauses in their contracts that prohibit class-action arbitration. A group of small merchants argued that American Express had violated antitrust laws by using its monopoly power to charge credit card fees 30 percent higher than those of its competitors. But American Express had used the same monopoly power to draft a form contract that directed all legal disputes into arbitration — and then forbade arbitration on a class-wide basis. The merchants argued that because antitrust claims are so expensive to prove, they are not worth pursuing on an individual basis and can be vindicated only through collective, class-wide proceedings.The Supreme Court previously ruled that contracts may require arbitration rather than court litigation only if the arbitration proceeding provides an adequate forum for individuals to vindicate their rights. In Italian Colors, the court’s majority conceded that requiring individual arbitrations would make it too expensive to challenge American Express’s conduct, but, as Justice Elena Kagan paraphrased the majority’s response in her dissent: “Too darn bad.”In three other closely divided decisions, the court’s conservative justices made equality rights decidedly harder to enforce. In Shelby County v. Holder, the court invalidated a key provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that required select states with a history of discrimination to clear any changes in their voting arrangements with the federal government ahead of time, by showing that the changes would not dilute the rights of minority voters. This preclearance requirement was the most effective part of the law because it prevented discriminatory actions from taking effect in the first place, rather than requiring victims to later sue in court, where challenges are often so expensive and time-consuming that they cannot adequately address many discriminatory voting practices.The court previously upheld the preclearance requirement four times, but on Tuesday the conservative majority broke with years of precedent and concluded that the rights of states are more important than the equal voting rights of minority citizens.In a pair of less-noticed decisions released the day before Shelby County, the court, once again by 5 to 4votes, issued employer-friendly, worker-hostile interpretations of Title VII, the section of the Civil Rights Act that prohibits discrimination in employment. In both cases, the court rejected long-standing interpretations of the law by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, the court imposed a more demanding standard on “retaliation” claims, brought when an employer responds to a discrimination complaint by punishing the employee for raising the issue.And in Vance v. Ball State University, the court narrowed the definition of “supervisors” under Title VII, thereby reducing employers’ responsibility for racial and sexual harassment in the workplace. Title VII says employers are more responsible for harassment from supervisors than from co-workers, and the EEOC had sensibly defined “supervisor” as a person with the authority to direct another’s daily work. But the court’s conservatives limited “supervisors” to those who have the formal authority to hire, fire, and grant or deny promotions, a much narrower group. The ruling means that victims of harassment by supervisors who lack such formal authority will be significantly less protected.The justices also curtailed our rights against the police. In Maryland v. King, the court ruled that the state can take DNA samples from arrestees without a warrant or any basis for suspicion. It reasoned that DNA samples, like fingerprints, are taken for identification purposes, not to investigate a crime, and so don’t have to meet the “individualized suspicion” standard that applies to investigatory searches. But as Justice Scalia pointed out in a dissent joined by Justices Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, DNA samples are not taken to identify arrestees but to investigate whether they are responsible for some other crime.The practice of taking DNA samples, if strictly limited to identifying characteristics and not used to determine an individual’s genetic traits, may seem reasonable enough, as the intrusion is minor. But allowing sweeping searches without individualized suspicion runs contrary to the court’s long-standing Fourth Amendment rules.Meanwhile, in Salinas v. Texas, the court’s conservative majority ruled, paradoxically, that Americans’ right to remain silent won’t be protected unless they speak up. The court decided that if someone refuses to answer potentially incriminating questions, it’s perfectly permissible for the state to use that refusal in a criminal trial, as long as the questions were asked outside the trial or an interrogation in custody. The result is that individuals who believe they have a right to remain silent (having been so informed by countless television shows) and exercise it will be punished for doing so.Of course, the high court was not uniformly hostile to individual rights. In addition to striking down the Defense of Marriage Act’s limits on federal marriage benefits, it also gave a partial victory to Abigail Fisher, a white applicant who challenged the University of Texas’s affirmative action plan; in that case, the court compromised, concluding that the lower courts had not subjected the university’s plan to sufficient scrutiny, and sent the case back for further review. But of course that ruling, issued in the name of equal protection, actually limits efforts to remove barriers for minorities.The larger pattern is clear: This term, the Roberts court regularly favored restricting people’s rights or, more insidiously, limiting their ability to enforce those rights.Almost all these rulings were 5 to 4 decisions, most divided along familiar ideological lines. The close votes reflect the fact that there were reasonable arguments to be made on both sides. But courts play an essential role in safeguarding individual rights, and in this term, the Supreme Court repeatedly did the opposite. Congress could, of course, fix many of the problems through legislation — but leaving the protection of individual rights to a polarized and partisan institution offers cold comfort.

    Latest setback for landmark legislationParts of ObamaCare are starting to fray, even before full implementation.The Obama administration now says a special system of exchanges designed to make it easier for small businesses to provide insurance will be delayed an entire year -- to 2015."Lots of small businesses struggle with providing insurance for their workers so this was supposed to facilitate it and make it easier for small business to do this," said Jim Capretta of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. "It was a huge portion of the sale job. When they passed the law in 2010 there were many senators and members of Congress who were saying 'I am doing this because it's going to help small businesses.'"The exchanges were designed to give workers a range of choices supported by dollars from their employers. But now they will have only one choice until 2015, which could mean they can't shop for insurance that includes their current providers. Capretta said the administration is "way" behind schedule.Since insurance is more expensive for small businesses, many of which have no obligation under the law to provide coverage, analysts now fear many might just stop trying and let workers go on the soon-to-be-launched state exchanges.Sara Teppema of the Society of Actuaries -- which did an exhaustive study of ObamaCare -- said that "even if it's just a small change of people who are leaving the employment-based insurance and coming into the individual insurance market, their costs and their numbers will overwhelm those who are currently uninsured."That means costs would increase.Meanwhile, 79 senators including several liberal lawmakers recently voted to repeal a new tax on medical devices contained in the health care law following a similar vote in the House."The House and the Senate agreeing? This is a harmonic convergence, it doesn't happen," said former Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh. "But on this it's happened because the adverse consequences to our economy and the quality of health care are so apparent."The two separate votes have not become law but show widespread opposition to the 2.3 percent sales tax on medical devices. Critics say the law is unfair to the industry since it's a tax on gross sales -- meaning it adds up to a much bigger percentage of a company's profits.But supporters such as Paul Van de Water of the Center for American Progress oppose any repeal."I think that repealing the device tax would be irresponsible. We need the revenue and it's not going to be a job killer," he said.The theory was that ObamaCare would insure 30 million more people and that device makers, like pharmaceutical companies, would get lots of new customers and a steady stream of new revenue to make up for the tax. Van de Water predicted that would still happen."These device manufacturers are for the most part going to be getting a large increase in business thanks to health reform, thanks to ObamaCare," he said. But the CEO of one company said that's not true for the 7,000 small companies with 400,000 employees who make a wide range of devices.Christine Jacobs of Theragenics said: "We make widgets -- hips, knees, stents, pacemakers, and implants, even, for prostate cancer. Those widgets tend to be used by people that are elderly. As the body parts wear out, we're needed."But Jacobs notes that most people whose body parts wear out are already on Medicare, so ObamaCare does not provide a new revenue stream for her company -- only financial pain."In the case of a small company, that medical device tax is equal to our R-and-D budget for this year," Jacobs said.Bayh said in his own state of Indiana, one company planned to open up to five facilities over the next five years but had to scrap those plans because of the "uncertainty created by this tax."Jacobs said the huge multinational device makers might be able to handle the burden but not the small companies."It's just such a disproportionate burden for little guys," she said. "Because we're all being told that it's the little companies that create the jobs. And that's not message that we're getting."The tax will even be applied to sutures used on pets that Theragenics developed for the veterinary market.She sought FDA approval to demonstrate the quality of her products. But now she said "it's hard for me not to get frosted on this one" -- she explained that whoever wrote the regulations said "if you have FDA approval, you will be taxed." President Obama has vowed to veto any repeal of the tax, but Bayh notes that 79 votes in the Senate would be more than enough to override any veto.Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inboxSubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!

      In a public statement that will be released Thursday morning but has been provided exclusively to Breitbart News ahead of its public release, USCIS Council president Kenneth Palinkas warned that Goodlatte (pictured), House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-VA), House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor (R-VA), and Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) seem to be following the same pathway that Senate “Gang of Eight” members did, regarding how they are working on immigration legislation. “At every step, this administration places obstacles and roadblocks in front of our adjudication officers in their attempts to protect our nation’s security and the American taxpayer,” Palinkas said. “I documented these abuses on more than one occasion with the authors of Schumer-Rubio-Corker-Hoeven [S. 744] only to have them ignored. “I worry the House may be following a similar path. Media reports reveal that Chairman Bob Goodlatte, Chairman Paul Ryan, Congressman Luis Gutierrez, and Majority Leader Eric Cantor are working to advance proposals to open citizenship benefits to the majority of those here illegally, in combination with proposals to expand visa programs.”Palinkas warned, too, that any group of “step-by-step” House immigration bills may be used as a tool by congressional leaders to get to a conference committee, at which point they would be combined with the Senate bill and sent to the president for his signature, and illegal immigrants would start getting amnesty. That is exactly what House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Gang of Eight members Sens. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) and Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and some Republicans have said they want to do. “These plans are being pursued before first reforming the very agency – USCIS – that will be charged with reviewing these tens of millions of green card, temporary visa and citizenship applications,” Palinkas said. “Advancing such measures without first confronting the widespread abuses at USCIS would be to invite disaster.”In his statement, Palinkas cited a recent MSNBC report where Gutierrez said he, Goodlatte, and others have worked on a “compromise” position. That MSNBC report also noted that Goodlatte and other Republicans are working with Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX), another Democrat, on a plan to get to conference with the Senate bill. Palinkas stated that USCIS agents have been, like they were from the Senate conversations, excluded from all discussions among House leaders. “Why aren’t USCIS officers being consulted on this ‘compromise’ offer?” Palinkas asked. He further expressed concern over Cantor’s GOP DREAM Act, tentatively called the KIDS act. “I am also worried about the arguments being used to support the KIDS Act, one piece of the wider citizenship plan being drafted,” Palinkas said. “Legislators, including Mr. Cantor and Mr. Goodlatte, have suggested that it is improper to apply immigration law to younger illegal aliens. But if it is improper to apply immigration law to one specific group of illegal aliens, then why should we expect future illegal aliens in this group to be treated any differently?” He warned that the KIDS Act may lead down a slippery slope. “This seems like an argument for extending birthright citizenship in the future to include the foreign citizens of other countries,” Palinkas asserted. “Should we just expect that the next Secretary at DHS will use the arguments we are hearing in the House to enact the next Deferred Action program in anticipation of the next legislated amnesty?”Palinkas alleged that, under the Obama administration, USCIS has been riddled with nefarious activities. “At USCIS, our institutional mission has been corrupted by politics, and I hope these abuses will be examined and fixed before any amnesty proposal is brought forward in the House,” he said. He finished off his statement by listing several immigration issues he hoped House Republicans would address but have thus far not been willing to: “USCIS adjudications officers lack the mission support to safely screen and review applicants for immigration benefits. This includes the inability to conduct in-person interviews, the failure of our software system, the lack of training and office space, and pressure to rubber-stamp applications. We have become an approval machine,” “Failure to protect taxpayers from abuses of the welfare system by those granted immigration benefits,” “Administrative orders that require us to grant immigration benefits to those who, under law, are not properly eligible,” “Approval quotas placed on adjudicators that emphasizes clearing applications more than vetting them,” “A management culture that sees illegal aliens and foreign nationals, not US citizens and taxpayers, as the customer. We believe in treating all with respect and always will, but our agency’s focus must be keeping the country safe and secure on behalf of the American people.”Goodlatte, Ryan, and Cantor are not the only Republicans still pushing to pass an immigration bill in the House of Representatives. According to the Miami Herald, Rep. Steve Southerland (R-FL) said about immigration: “We have to address it. It’s a moral issue.”In addition, according to Politico, House GOP conference chairwoman Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) said she thinks immigration should be a top priority for House Republicans this year. This coming weekend on Univision, McMorris Rodgers will say that House Speaker John Boehner “over the last few weeks has continued to talk about the importance of the House moving forward on immigration reform. I believe that we have a window here between now and the end of the year and that this is a priority.”McMorris Rodgers is the fourth highest-ranking member in the House GOP conference.PoliticsIllegal AliensMSNBCSenate.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 BreitbartTo complete your CNN profile and ensure you are able to receive important account information, please verify your email address.

  The Obama administration finalized rules on Friday that allow religious-affiliated organizations opposing the use of contraception to opt out of a federal mandate requiring that they provide their employees with insurance coverage for birth control.

  The mandates give women at nonprofit, religious-based organizations, like certain hospitals and universities, the ability to receive contraception through separate health policies at no charge. 

  The rules, which were first proposed in February and then open for comment through April, have undergone only minor changes. Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, deputy director for policy and regulations at  the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said in a call with reporters that the rules were “very similar” to the administration’s original proposal.

  One of the few noticeable changes is the process by which insurance companies reimburse nonprofit religious organizations – such as nonprofit religious hospitals and institutions of higher education – that object to contraceptive coverage. This process, officials from HHS said, has provided more distance between the groups that disapprove of contraceptive use and the insurance companies that will be supplying contraceptives to their employees at no cost.

  These slight changes, said one HHS representative, came after hearing from stakeholders during a public comment period this year. In total, more than 400,000 comments were sent to the department on the rule.

  Objecting organizations and insurers will have until January 1, 2014, to comply with the new rules. This date was extended from August 1, 2013.

  “The health care law guarantees millions of women access to recommended preventive services at no cost,” Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a Friday news release. “Today’s announcement reinforces our commitment to respect the concerns of houses of worship and other non-profit religious organizations that object to contraceptive coverage, while helping to ensure that women get the care they need, regardless of where they work.”

  Since Obamacare was signed into law in 2010, administration officials have said the administration has attempted to work out how nonprofit organizations can decline to provide contraception coverage to their employees on religious grounds without facing a penalty.

  In a news release about the finalized plans, administration officials say these final rules “strike the appropriate” balance.

  In February, the health agency said that while it could not provide a final cost of the plan, offering free coverage would lower expenses over the long term, partly because of improvements in women’s health and fewer childbirths.

  As part of the new rules, groups that are insured – such as with student health plans at religious colleges – would be required to let their insurer know that certain participants would like contraception coverage.

  Because the insurer would be covering the costs, the changes would allow religious organizations morally opposed to contraception to avoid paying for it.

  Although many religious groups applauded the compromise, not everyone heralded it as a success.

  The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said in February that it does not support the Obama administration’s proposals because they  fall short of addressing concerns about religious freedom.

  “Because the stakes are so high, we will not cease from our effort to assure that health care for all does not mean freedom for few,” Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York, president of the conference, said in a February statement. “We will continue to stand united with brother bishops, religious institutions, and individual citizens who seek redress in the courts for as long as this is necessary.”

  Those calls of disapproval continued after Friday’s finalization of the contraceptive plans.

  “This latest rule shows the administration is tone-deaf to religious freedom,” said Anna Higgins, director at the Family Research Council. “Family Research Council strongly opposes the latest regulation that continues to mandate that life-ending drugs and contraceptive services be covered, with no copay, by health plans of businesses and organizations that have serious moral and religious objections.”

  Michael Hash, director of the Office of Health Reform for HHS, said the changes that were made took into account suggestions from religious organizations that objected to the rules.

  “I think there is a much brighter line, simpler line, and we think that responds to the good many comments that we got,” he said.

  An original mandate on providing contraception was part of the new federal health care law spearheaded by President Obama, the Affordable Care Act. It required that insurers provide, at no cost to those insured, all forms of contraception approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

  Houses of worship were exempt immediately, and the administration widened those exemptions last year to include other religiously affiliated organizations, like universities and hospitals.

  That still left groups across a wide spectrum of faiths – many of which teach that contraception is morally wrong – covered by the mandate. They denounced it as an infringement on religious liberty. A group of 43 Catholic organizations challenged the rules in federal court in May.

  The administration had long defended the mandate, saying that it did not violate religious liberties.

  The finalized proposal also clarified the definition of a religious employer.

  Instead of using a multipart test that required an employer to show “religious values as its purpose” and to “employ persons who share its religious tenets,” the proposal followed the Internal Revenue Code’s definition that includes “churches, other houses of worship, and their affiliated organizations.”

  After an uproar among religious institutions that didn’t want to pay for contraceptives, the Obama administration offered several alternatives in March 2012. These plans are a continuation of those efforts.

  The issue of Obama’s health care act mandating contraception coverage became a hot-button political issue during last year’s presidential race.

  In August 2012, Republican nominee Mitt Romney released a television ad that attacked the Obama administration.

  “President Obama used his health care plan to declare war on religion, forcing religious institutions to go against their faith,” the ad said. “Mitt Romney believes that is wrong.”

  Although the ad did not specifically mention the contraception rule, a news release that accompanied the ad justified the “war on religion” claim using an editorial published in the San Antonio Express-News in February about the health care law’s rule on providing contraception.

Cispa is designed to help combat cyberthreats by making it easier for law enforcers to get at web data.This is the second time Cispa has been passed by the House. Senators threw out the first draft, saying it did not do enough to protect privacy.Cispa could fail again in the Senate after threats from President Obama to veto it over privacy concerns.A substantial majority of politicians in the House backed the bill.The law is passing through the US legislative system as American federal agencies warn that malicious hackers, motivated by money or acting on behalf of foreign governments, such as China, are one of the biggest threats facing the nation."If you want to take a shot across China's bow, this is the answer," said Mike Rogers, the Republican politician who co-wrote Cispa and chairs the House Intelligence Committee.Cispa has also secured the backing of several technology firms, including the CTIA wireless industry group, as well as the TechNet computer industry lobby group, which has Google, Apple and Yahoo as members. By contrast, the social news website Reddit has been vocal in its opposition to the bill. In March, Facebook said it no longer supported Cispa.The bill could fail again in the Senate after the Obama administration's threat to use its veto unless changes were made. The White House wants amendments so more is done to ensure the minimum amount of data is handed over in investigations.The American Civil Liberties Union has also opposed Cispa, saying the bill was "fatally flawed". The Electronic Frontier Foundation, Reporters Without Borders and the American Library Association have all voiced similar worries.Cispa's authors say existing amendments have addressed many of the criticisms and more oversight was being given to data before it was handed over.White House threatens Cispa vetoActivists switch on net 'bat signal'Cyber-security bill past US HouseCongressman Mike RogersJordan: Prince Hamzah plotted against kingdomThe king's half-brother sought to mobilise tribal leaders against the government, the deputy PM says.France enters third lockdown as ICU numbers surgeState of emergency over Florida toxic water leak'We found a baby on the subway - now he's our son'Long lost pen pals reunited after 70 years.

The new files "provided by Edward Snowden illustrate the scale of cooperation between Silicon Valley and the intelligence agencies over the last three years," the Guardian said.Microsoft, in a statement to NBC News, did not address the encryption workaround specifically, but said, "We only ever comply with orders about specific accounts or identifiers, and we would not respond to the kind of blanket orders discussed in the press over the past few weeks, as the volumes documented in our most recent disclosure clearly illustrate. "To be clear, Microsoft does not provide any government with blanket or direct access to SkyDrive, Outlook.com, Skype or any Microsoft product."The company said when it upgrades or updates products, "legal obligations may in some circumstances require that we maintain the ability to provide information in response to a law enforcement or national security request. There are aspects of this debate that we wish we were able to discuss more freely. That's why we've argued for additional transparency that would help everyone understand and debate these important issues." ACLU principal technologist Chris Soghoian told NBC News that the new revelations show that "time and time again, companies that specifically advertise their services as privacy protecting have been forced to circumvent those privacy protections to enable the government to spy on their customers."Microsoft isn't the only technology company believed to be cooperating with the government to share data, but it is the first to have more details revealed since the initial disclosures last month by Snowden. At that time, he said that Microsoft and other technology companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, Yahoo and AOL were allowing the FBI and NSA to look at Americans' video, audio, photos, emails and other data files under what is known as the Prism program. Most of the companies, including Microsoft, have since requested government permission to share the information requests that have been made to them.According to the information shared by Snowden with the Guardian, Microsoft "helped the NSA to circumvent its encryption to address concerns that the agency would be able to intercept Web chats on the new Outlook.com portal."Microsoft completed the transfer of its 300 million Hotmail users to Outlook.com, a more modern webmail experience, in May. The NSA "already had pre-encryption stage access to email on Outlook.com, including Hotmail," the Guardian said.The Redmond, Wash.-based company "also worked with the FBI's Data Intercept Unit to 'understand' potential issues with a feature in Outlook.com that allows users to create email aliases," the newspaper said.Video-chat service Skype "worked with intelligence agencies last year to allow Prism to collect video of conversations as well as audio," the Guardian said. There have been concerns since Microsoft bought Skype in 2011 about what data the Redmond company is sharing with law enforcement. Last January, dozens of organizations, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Digital Rights Foundation, sent an open letter to Microsoft asking how, when and why the popular video chatting program complies with government requests for information. In March, Microsoft published a transparency report about Skype, and other of its services. "Microsoft and Skype received a total of 75,378 law enforcement requests," the company said in the report. "Those requests potentially impacted 137,424 accounts. While it is not possible to directly compare the number of requests to the number of users affected, it is likely that less than 0.02 percent of active users were affected."The Guardian reports that Microsoft also worked with the FBI this year "to allow the NSA easier access via Prism to its cloud storage service SkyDrive, which now has more than 250 million users worldwide."In its statement Thursday, Microsoft said it has "clear principles which guide the response across our entire company to government demands for customer information for both law enforcement and national security issues."The company takes its "commitments to our customers and to compliance with applicable law very seriously, so we provide customer data only in response to legal processes." Microsoft's compliance team "examines all demands very closely, and we reject them if we believe they aren't valid."Snowden, 30, has worked with the Guardian since last month to share information he learned in his time as an NSA contractor about data-gathering practices of the NSA, one of the country's most secretive agencies.He is now believed to be staying in the transit zone of Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport, as he decides where he can go for asylum and where he can avoid being extradited to the United States. Federal prosecutors have charged Snowden with three counts of espionage.© 2021 NBC UNIVERSALLon Snowden (bên phải) và luật sư của ông đã nói chuyện với các nhà báoLuật sư cho hay ông Lon Snowden, cha của Edward Snowden, đã nhận được visa và sẽ sớm đi Nga thăm con trai.Ông Snowden cha nói với kênh truyền thông ABC của Mỹ rằng ông mong muốn con mình trở về Mỹ với điều kiện hệ thống pháp lý được bảo đảm công minh trong trường hợp này.Ông nói thêm rằng con trai ông "đã nói lên sự thật" và hy sinh nhiều thứ.Edward Snowden đã được Nga cho tỵ nạn mặc dù Mỹ yêu cầu dẫn độ ông về nước để xử lý.Lon Snowden đã xuất hiện với luật sư của ông là Bruce Fein trên kênh ABC.Luật sư Fein nói về kế hoạch đi Moscow: "Chúng tôi đã có visa, đã có ngày tháng nhưng chúng tôi không muốn tiết lộ vì sợ bị săn đuổi".Edward Snowden tới Moscow ngày 23/6 từ Hong Kong, sau khi rò rỉ thông tin về chương trình do thám mật của Mỹ cho báo chí.Sau đó ông đã trải qua hơn 5 tuần ở khu quá cảnh sân bay Sheremetyevo, Moscow.

The government says it needs the time to sort through the allegations in the 65-page complaint. It doesn't help, Justice Department lawyers say, that Pentagon employees have been furloughed because of sequestration."We are pleased that the federal government appears to be taking this case seriously, and is taking extra time to conduct its internal inquiry in response to this lawsuit," Raul said in a statement.Kelley had been an unpaid social liaison to the military and had hosted parties for military officials, including Petraeus and Gen. John Allen, at her home on Tampa's Bayshore Boulevard. The headquarters of Central Command, which oversees military action in the Middle East, is a few miles away.Petraeus' extramarital affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell, was exposed after Kelley complained to the FBI about harassing e-mails she had received. Broadwell was behind them.Allen's name also popped up in Kelley's e-mails.That prompted then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta to call for an investigation of Allen's relationship with Kelley to determine if there had been "professional misconduct" on his part. Allen and Kelley say there was nothing inappropriate about their relationship. The Pentagon inspector general agreed, although the Defense Department refuses to release its findings. USA TODAY and other news organizations have filed multiple requests for the report but have been denied.Allen and Kelley exchanged 3,000 e-mails from July 2010 to July 2012, according to Rep. Jackie Speier, the California Democrat on the Armed Services Committee. She was briefed by the inspector general on the report but not shown the document. Of those e-mails, 41 were reviewed more thoroughly, Speier was told.Speier wants Allen to divulge e-mails from his private account to Kelley. He refused to provide them to the inspector general, Speier said.Kelley and her husband, Scott, want an apology and unspecified damages for what they say were willful leaks by federal officials of false and damaging information about them. Those officials should have been protecting them and their privacy, they say in their lawsuit."The Kelleys are trying to deter the government from violating the privacy rights of other Americans by calling attention to the government's profound over-collection of private e-mails and egregious leaking of confidential investigative material," Raul said.WSJ MembershipCustomer ServiceTools & FeaturesAdsMoreDow Jones ProductsPerhaps we can help you find what you wanted when you hit this error page?Try our site map for a list of all online sections or check out our columnists page.We also have search tools for finding a particular stories and topics pages covering many major issues and people.If you are looking for a particular suburban publication or story, the best place to start is our suburbs page.

PetersWASHINGTON — Frustrations in the Senate over the slow pace of approval for President Obama’s second-term cabinet deepened Thursday even as the Senate voted 97 to 0 to confirm Mr. Obama’s nominee for a long-vacant seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.That vote to confirm the nominee, Sri Srinivasan, which was added to the calendar at the last minute after Republicans dropped objections that would have delayed it two more weeks, came as Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, took to the Senate floor to denounce Democrats. Mr. McConnell directed most of his anger at Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, accusing him of trying to jam the nomination through and force a rule change that would limit the minority party’s ability to block nominations.“What I fear is the majority leader is working his way toward breaking his word to the Senate and to the American people, and blowing up this institution,” Mr. McConnell said.“He wants to have no debate,” he continued. “ ‘Do what I say when I say it. Sit down, shut up. Or we’ll change the rules. We’ll break the rules to change the rules.’ ”Both parties were closely watching Mr. Srinivasan’s path to confirmation as a test case for other high-profile Obama nominations to come. The court on which he will serve is considered the most important in the country after the Supreme Court and often decides cases involving government regulations and the power of federal agencies. Its judges have become Supreme Court justices. But Thursday’s vote resolved only one of several messy confirmation battles that are brewing.With other nominations in the pipeline that Republicans have threatened to delay — including those to head the Labor Department and the Environmental Protection Agency — Democrats are discussing rewriting Senate rules to prevent Republicans from forcing a 60-vote supermajority on cabinet-level nominees, a procedure that before this year had been used just twice in nearly 100 years.But the politics of such a move are dangerous, Democrats concede. The Senate is soon to start considering an immigration bill that will need considerable Republican support to succeed. And Democrats seem, at least for the time being, unwilling to sacrifice immigration overhaul in a fight over the filibuster.“I’m going to do nothing to interfere with immigration,” Mr. Reid said Thursday, echoing the sentiment of many of his members that a rules change could not happen until after immigration was dealt with. To that end, Mr. Reid will postpone scheduling votes on the president’s more controversial pending nominees.An alternative possibility is that a bipartisan group of senators could try to reach a deal on the filibuster themselves, that way averting a confrontation that would further strain the already distrustful relationship between the two parties.Republicans have threatened to filibuster several Obama appointees. Among them: Gina McCarthy, the president’s choice to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, on the ground that she was not forthcoming in responding to their written questions. (They sent her nearly 1,100.) The nomination of Thomas E. Perez for labor secretary is in peril because Republicans view his work as head of the Justice Department’s civil rights division as too political. They have vowed to block Mr. Obama’s pick to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Richard Cordray, because they object on principle to the existence of such a bureau. And nominees to the National Labor Relations Board are meeting similar obstacles.“There may be some that we really have a fight over,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, saying a drawn-out argument over nominations could do considerable harm to the Senate. “So that’s when we have to think this thing through,” he added, saying he would support reopening talks with Democrats over changing the rules on filibusters. “If it becomes a problem and we get hung up over cabinet nominees, yes, I’d be willing to.”There does appear to be one bright spot for the administration: the nomination of Penny Pritzker as commerce secretary. Ms. Pritzker, a Chicago businesswoman who was a top fund-raiser for Mr. Obama, appeared before the Senate Commerce Committee on Thursday and met little resistance from Republicans.But even a relatively gentle confirmation process for Ms. Pritzker is unlikely to resolve the bigger differences between Republicans and Democrats. Republicans point out that they have approved the majority of Mr. Obama’s nominees. But the new lengths to which they have gone to slow down confirmation — including the first-ever filibuster of a defense secretary nominee and requests that nominees respond to hundreds of written questions — have made the process highly contentious.Senator Mary Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, said that after the Senate voted on immigration changes she would support efforts to broker a compromise on the use of the filibuster. “It might be a good time to sit down and talk about what can be done, because it’s really just truly shameful,” she said. Ms. Landrieu, like Mr. Graham, helped negotiate the 2005 pact that limited the use of filibusters on judicial nominees to all but “extraordinary circumstances.”Such an agreement would be welcomed by many Democrats, who despite their anger with Republicans are reluctant to force a rule change that could later be used against them.Mr. Reid is confident that a parliamentary ruling would allow him to limit the use of the filibuster on cabinet-level nominees by obtaining a simple 51-vote majority. Usually a two-thirds vote is required for a rules change.But many Democrats worry that they might someday wish for the protections that Senate rules afford to the minority party.“Amazingly enough, the American people do from time to time change their minds about who they would like to be running the country,” Mr. McConnell said. “The shoe could be on the other foot. You never know when.”AdvertisementPresident Obama has invited the president of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority to the White House for a Tuesday afternoon meeting, ending  months of hope and speculation by leaders of the nation’s largest African American sorority who have been gathered in Washington this past week for their 100th anniversary celebration.White House spokesman Kevin Lewis confirmed that Obama will meet with Cynthia Butler-McIntyre. The conversation will come about two hours before an appearance at the convention by former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton, who will speak during the second-to-last day of the convention, which has brought more than 40,000 members to the District.Although sorority leaders said they are pleased that Obama will meet with Butler-McIntyre, many members had hoped that Obama would visit one of the largest conventions  in D.C.’s history. Many members of the sorority expressed disappointment that neither the president nor first lady Michelle Obama would be making an official appearance. On Monday, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. spoke to the Deltas. In addition to talking about the recent Supreme Court ruling striking down parts of the Voting Rights Act, Holder spoke about the shooting of Trayvon Martin and subsequent trial and acquittal of the shooter, George Zimmerman.“They suffered a pain that no parent should endure,” Holder said of Martin’s parents. Holder said the Justice Department has already launched an investigation as to whether or not Martin’s civil rights were violated.The Rev. Al Sharpton and group of pastors from across the country held a news conference outside the Justice Department on Monday to announce that Florida will be the “battleground,” for a new civil rights movement.The Deltas’ conference began last week and will continue through Wednesday. Events have included a step show, an ecumenical service, a social-action luncheon, a gospel concert and the dedication of a stained-glass window — depicting African American women — at Howard University’s Andrew Rankin Memorial Chapel.

        President Barack Obama talks with his nominee for Labor Secretary, Thomas E. Perez, during an announcement, Monday, March 18, 2013, in the East Room of the White House in Washington. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) Labor secretary nominee Thomas Perez cut a "secret deal behind closed doors" with leaders of a Minnesota city, persuading them to drop a contentious lawsuit in exchange for the Justice Department staying out of whistleblower cases brought against the city, according to a congressional Republican report.The "quid pro quo," according to the report, potentially cost taxpayers as much as $200 million.The allegations are highly unusual, though are already being disputed by congressional Democrats. Perez is not a favorite of congressional Republicans, and the charges could impact his pending confirmation hearing -- scheduled for this Thursday.The report, obtained in advance by Fox News, claimed Perez in February 2012 "manipulated" federal law as assistant attorney general and "pushed the limits of justice to make this deal happen."Both cases involved the city of St. Paul. The 67-page report states that the Justice Department's decision to opt out of the whistleblower cases potentially cost taxpayers as much as $200 million -- the amount the government could have won had it pursued damages in the case.But, according to the report, the Justice Department stayed away from that case in order to get the city to drop an appeal to the Supreme Court on another matter. The department was allegedly concerned that the high court, in the course of reviewing that case, would strike down a major element of civil rights enforcement."Perez simply could not allow the Court to rule," the report said. "Perez sought leverage to stop the city from pressing its appeal."The case the Justice Department was allegedly concerned about was St. Paul's appeal to the Supreme Court, on a case in which property owners said the city made extraordinary efforts, through strict code enforcement, to condemn their properties.The owners said reducing the amount of affordable housing for minorities violated the federal Fair Housing Act -- by what is known as "disparate impact."Perez appeared to think the Supreme Court overturning the case would have been a severe blow to civil rights enforcement, the report concluded.The "disparate impact" provision, which the report described as legally questionable, prohibits housing policies that end up discriminating against certain groups even if those policies are not blatantly discriminatory."Perez sought, facilitated, and consummated this deal because he feared that the Court would find disparate impact unsupported by the text of the Fair Housing Act," the report said.The other end of the alleged deal was for the Justice Department not to get involved in cases against the city of St. Paul that alleged the city received millions in Department of Housing and Urban Development funds -- including stimulus money -- but failed to file the requisite paperwork regarding the hiring of low-income workers.In that case, which also involved the city of Minneapolis, plaintiff Thomas Newell got neither the backing of the agency nor the Justice Department and lost the case, which if won would likely have resulted in the cities repaying tens of millions in damages.The Obama administration has acknowledged that senior Justice Department attorneys recommended intervening in the case and characterized the False Claims Act infractions reported by Newell as "particularly egregious."However, they thought the case would be "quite weak and never should have been a serious candidate for intervention," according to the report.The Justice Department claims everything was above board -- and that the department held three staff briefings, heard 24 hours of additional testimony and reviewed 1,400 pages of documents before deciding not to intervene."The litigation decisions made by the department were in the best interests of the United States and were consistent with the department's legal, ethical, and professional responsibility obligations," the department said in a statement.Former Justice Department spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler also questioned the use of the term "quid pro quo" to describe what happened."It's such a loaded term," she said. "I think in fact you have almost everybody agreeing nothing inappropriate happened."The report -- subtitled "How Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez manipulated Justice and Ignored Rule of Law" -- was a joint effort by minority leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Republican-led House's Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform committees."The facts surrounding this quid pro quo show that Perez may have exceeded the scope of the ethics and professional-responsibility opinions he received from the department and thereby violated his duties of loyalty and confidentiality to the United States. Perez also misled senior Justice Department officials about the quid pro quo," the report states.But congressional Democrats put out a statement and memo of their own late Sunday refuting the details.The statement said the "overwhelming evidence" indicates Perez and others "acted professionally to advance the interests of civil rights and effectively combat the scourge of discrimination in housing." They said the decision not to intervene in the suit against St. Paul was based on expert recommendations."Instead of identifying inappropriate conduct by Mr. Perez, it appears that the accusations against him are part of a broader political campaign to undermine the legal safeguards against discrimination that Mr. Perez was protecting," they said.Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inboxSubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!

      I’m sure Jeffrey Goldberg got it right. Whatever the reason the President leaked his unhappiness with Bibi to Goldberg just a few days before the Israeli election–whether in an effort to influence the vote against Bibi, serve payback to Bibi for a perceived preference for Romney, or because the President could simply no longer suppress his dissatisfaction–it must indeed be unnerving to be the most powerful man on earth and have the elected leader of a tiny Middle Eastern country defy you. Especially when that country, in your opinion, owes you so much! You are their only reliable friend who watches helplessly as that little nation continues to isolate itself through its self-destructive policies. According to Goldberg, Obama has “become inured to what he sees as self-defeating policies of his Israeli counterpart…Obama said privately and repeatedly, “Israel doesn’t know what its own best interests are… Netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near-total isolation.”If only Israel would recognize the President’s genius. If only it would stop building in Jerusalem and E1 and allow the President to sprinkle his magic peace dust, then Hamas would beat its rockets into ploughshares and Hezbollah would turn its bombs into pruning hooks. But no. Ungrateful to the last, Bibi insists on disobeying the President and claiming all of Jerusalem as Israel’s undivided capitol.No doubt the President is likewise mystified at the Israeli people as well. How could the polls show that they will this week re-elect the intransigent Prime Minister who is doing so much to harm their country? The most powerful man on earth is reduced to watching from the sidelines and complaining to journalists that he knows how to protect Israel far better than the Israelis themselves.Such an ungrateful nation.And yet, perhaps the Israelis have finally figured out that they are a sovereign people whom, while immensely grateful to America for its friendship and support, are still best qualified to judge their security needs better than anyone else. Perhaps they have come to understand that another Democratic president named Bill Clinton, whom noone would argue has a sincere love of the Jewish people and a Jewish son-in-law, still pushed Israel into the Oslo agreements that left a thousand Israeli civilians blown to bits. Perhaps they have come to understand that if Chuck Hagel, President Obama’s nominee for Secretary of Defense, was correct that, as a legislator from Nebraska he was “not an Israeli senator. I’m a United States senator,” then the Prime Minister of Israel is the likewise the leader of the Jewish state who must put the security of the Israeli people even before a nod of approval from the President of the United States.Over the past four years Bibi has grown into one of Israel’s greatest ever leaders. The country is booming economically and in terms of security. Cranes dot the skyline of expanding Israeli cities, terror incidents are negligible compared to the Clinton era, and unlike the anemic American economy, Israel is humming along at about four percent annual growth. And if President Obama is right that, in spite of this prosperity, Israel is isolated in world opinion, then it is arguably no more so than it has been in the past, and, besides, what is better, a popular Israel riddled with dead Jews or an unpopular Israel filled with living ones?But what President Obama does not understand about Netanyahu is that the inflexibility he accuses him of is born not of a narrow-minded obstinacy but rather of a confident Jewish pride and deep-seated conviction that has been Bibi’s lifelong hallmark.In my desire in 1990 to launch a robust response to anti-Israel speeches at the Oxford Union, I booked Netanyahu to lecture at the University. Bibi, just 41 years old, had already electrified the world as Israel’s most capable defender at the UN. Bibi agreed to come with a single stipulation: “If I’m already making the trip, then work me like a horse.”We obliged.We picked him up in a special branch police car and as we drove through the grandeur of Oxford’s ancient center, he commented on the majesty of British academia and its incongruence with some of the petty anti-Israel sentiment that is often expressed within its halls. Arriving at St. Antony’s College for a private forum with Oxford Middle East experts, Bibi put one foot on a chair and for the next 90 minutes held forth on the justice of Israel’s cause, surrounded as it was by nation’s sworn to its destruction. As he finished, the attacks came in fast and furious in what had to be one of the most hostile audiences he ever addressed. He did not blink, he did not flinch, he did not bend. When the last question ended, he turned to me to ask what next. After two more speeches, we took him to my home where we had arranged a dinner with Rhodes Scholars, many of them Jewish, most critical of Israeli policy. This time Bibi was softer in presentation but just as firm in conviction. Israel was a righteous nation, focused on maintaining democracy and human rights while facing existential threats on nearly every border. He spoke to the students of their responsibility to be proud defenders of their people and never bend in the face of opposition. The climax of the day was a lecture at the Union itself. Palestinian and Jewish protesters rallied outside in their hundreds with the rallying cry: “Net-an-ya-hu you should know, we support the P-L-O.” Bibi left his security bubble and walked over to the protesters. “Come inside and listen. Then you can protest. I’ll answer every question you ask.”Many left their barricades and joined the large crowd inside. What followed was one of the great speeches I have heard, a mesmerizing presentation of the need for democracy across the Middle East and the liberalization of Arab governments that deny their citizens their God-given human rights. At its high point Bibi said, “Many of us in Israel have buried children and lost brothers, in fulfillment of a simple dream for Jews to finally live and prosper in a country of their own in peace.” He did not have to mention whom he was referring to as even his detractors knew of Entebbe and the hero-brother he had lost.Again he was bombarded with hostile questions. He responded patiently but forcefully. When he finished he was given a standing ovation by most of the students in the hall. It was a night few of us would forget.No Israeli Prime Minister has ever been as American as Bibi. And yet no Prime Minister has so successfully resisted the pressure from the leader of a country he loves so much for a country he loves even more. And the Israeli people, in supporting Bibi regardless of the absence of a stamp of approval from President Obama, are finally realizing that Israel cannot ultimately be protected from Washington but Jerusalem, especially when the current American Administration is not in step with the strong sympathy of the American people for a tiny and just nation fighting for its life.Shmuley Boteach, “America’s Rabbi” whom The Washington Post calls “the most famous Rabbi in America,” has just published his newest best-seller, “The Fed-up Man of Faith: Challenging God in the Face of Tragedy and Suffering.” Follow him on Twitter @RabbiShmuley.This column is dedicated to the memory of Machla Debakarov, the mother of a close friend of Rabbi Shmuley’s.National SecurityDefenseWashington Post.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 BreitbartPolitics.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 BreitbartAdvertisementSupported byBy Jonathan Weisman and Jeremy W. PetersWASHINGTON — Congressional Republicans, not resting with the Internal Revenue Service scandal, are moving to broaden the matter to an array of tax malfeasances and “intimidation tactics” they hope will ensnare the White House.Republican charges range from clearly questionable actions to seemingly specious allegations, and they grow by the day. On Friday, lawmakers sought to tie the I.R.S. matter to the carrying out of President Obama’s health care law, which will rely heavily on the agency. Whether they succeed holds significant ramifications for Mr. Obama, who will soon know if he is dealing with a late spring thunderstorm that may soon blow over or a consuming squall that will leave lasting damage.Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan, the usually mild-mannered chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, set the tone Friday at Congress’s first hearing on the targeting of conservative groups by the I.R.S., laying out details, from the alleged threatening of donors to conservative nonprofit groups to the leaking of confidential I.R.S. documents.In that context, he said, the screening of Tea Party groups for special scrutiny was not the scandal itself but “just the latest example of a culture of cover-ups — and political intimidation — in this administration.”“It seems like the truth is hidden from the American people just long enough to make it through an election,” Mr. Camp said.Taken aback, the ranking Democrat on the committee, Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, modified his prepared remarks to warn, “If this hearing becomes essentially a bootstrap to continue the campaign of 2012 and to prepare for 2014, we will be making a very, very serious mistake.”Republicans raised a long list of issues. Mr. Camp contended, for instance, that a White House official’s divulging of a private company’s tax status constituted “a clear intimidation tactic.” The 2010 incident involved an offhand comment by the White House economist Austan Goolsbee that Koch Industries had not paid corporate income taxes because it pays taxes through the personal income tax code. As it turned out, that was not true, but the assertion was made in a discussion of tax reform ideas, not politics.The Republicans also criticized the publication of donors to the National Organization for Marriage, a group opposed to same-sex marriage. That donors list surfaced mysteriously in March 2012 from a whistle-blower whose identity is still unknown. The whistle-blower apparently obtained it by simply requesting it from the I.R.S. Linkage to the health care law came through Sarah Hall Ingram, a longtime I.R.S. official who has headed the agency’s program to carry out the Affordable Care Act since December 2010. Before that, she led the I.R.S.’s tax-exempt and government-entities division, which contained the political targeting effort. “This is an audit, and it’s helpful,” Representative Tim Griffin, Republican of Arkansas, said of the investigation of I.R.S. targeting by the Treasury inspector general for tax administration, “but it’s the tip of the iceberg.”But the inspector general made clear that effort did not reach the attention of high-level I.R.S. officials until 2011 at the earliest.The inspector general gave Republicans some fodder Friday when he divulged that he informed the Treasury’s general counsel he was auditing the I.R.S.’s screening of politically active groups seeking tax exemptions on June 4, 2012. He told Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal Wolin “shortly after,” he said. That meant Obama administration officials were aware of the matter during the presidential campaign year.The disclosure last summer came as part of a routine briefing of the investigations that the inspector general would be conducting in the coming year, and he did not tell the officials of his conclusions that the targeting had been improper, he said. Treasury officials stressed they did not know the results until March 2013, when the inspector presented a draft. “Treasury strongly supports the independent oversight of its three inspectors general, and it does not interfere in ongoing I.G. audits,” the department said in a statement Friday evening.Still, Inspector General J. Russell George’s testimony fueled efforts by Congressional Republicans to ensnare Mr. Obama in the scandals suddenly swirling over the White House. Representative Paul D. Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican who joined the national ticket as the vice-presidential nominee last year, said of the revelation, “That raises a big question.” Republicans hit hard on the divulging of confidential tax information, hinting of intimidation not only by the I.R.S. but also by the White House. In March 2012, the Human Rights Campaign and The Huffington Post made public confidential tax documents from the National Organization for Marriage. The Human Rights Campaign said it obtained the documents from a “whistle-blower” who mailed them to the gay rights group’s Washington headquarters.In a similar incident, ProPublica, an investigative journalism Web site, asked the I.R.S.’s Cincinnati office for the applications of 67 nonprofits, both liberal and conservative. When the I.R.S. responded, it inadvertently included applications for nine conservative groups that had not yet been granted tax-exempt status, a violation of confidentiality law.When ProPublica realized what it had — including the application from Crossroads GPS, the conservative group founded by Karl Rove and other Republican strategists — it alerted the I.R.S., which warned the journalists that “publishing unauthorized returns or return information was a felony” punishable by up to five years in prison. ProPublica ProPublica redacted certain details and published the documents anyway.Representative Peter Roskam, Republican of Illinois, hit on a different explanation. “On the one hand, you’re arguing today that the I.R.S. is not corrupt, but the subtext of that is you’re saying, ‘Look, we’re just incompetent,’ ” Mr. Roskam said. “It is a perilous pathway to go down.”One release that turned out to be advertent was last Friday’s disclosure of the agency’s conservative targeting. Steven Miller, the ousted acting commissioner of the I.R.S., confessed that the agency’s apology was prompted by a question planted by the agency at an American Bar Association meeting. At that meeting, Lois Lerner, the head of the I.R.S.’s division overseeing tax-exempt organizations, was asked about an inquiry into the targeting issue, eliciting an apology that quickly leaked out of the closed-door session. The I.R.S. then scrambled to issue a formal release on the issue. Mr. Miller divulged that the exchange was not an impromptu apology but a planned exchange between Ms. Lerner and Celia Roady, a tax lawyer at the Washington office of the Morgan Lewis law firm. That revelation only underscored the ham-handed way the scandal has burst into view. Under fire, Mr. Miller called the agency’s targeting of conservative groups “obnoxious,” but he told the House Ways and Means Committee it was not motivated by partisanship. And in testy exchanges, he said he had not misled Congress, even though he did not divulge the targeting efforts of a Cincinnati unit examining 70,000 applications for tax exemption. He called the group’s centralization of applications from groups with names that included the words “Tea Party” or “patriots” simply “foolish mistakes” that “were made by people trying to be more efficient in their workload selection.” AdvertisementWSJ MembershipCustomer ServiceTools & FeaturesAdsMoreDow Jones Products

    Questions surround use in U.S.As President Obama nominates a new FBI director, the bureau is coming under rising pressure from lawmakers to explain the limits of its recently disclosed drone fleet.Civil liberties-minded senators on both sides of the aisle have fired off sharply worded letters and statements in recent days criticizing the FBI for deploying surveillance drones without clear guidance on how to protect privacy rights.Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was the latest to scrutinize the bureau, sending a letter on Thursday to outgoing Director Robert Mueller asking a string of questions about his agency's drone use."I am disturbed by the revelation that the FBI has unilaterally decided to begin using drone surveillance technology without a governance policy, and thus without the requisite assurances that the constitutional rights of Americans are being protected," Paul wrote.Mueller acknowledged Wednesday, during a Senate hearing, that the bureau has a limited number of drones that it uses for surveillance on U.S. soil. He stressed they are used in a "very, very minimal way and very seldom." Newly released documents show that the FBI has sought and received permission from the FAA at least four times to fly surveillance drones inside the U.S. since 2010.The use of non-lethal drones for surveillance purposes is rapidly getting off the ground among local law enforcement agencies and other groups. Mueller, in acknowledging that the FBI, too, has obtained surveillance drones, said the bureau is in the "initial stages" of drafting rules and regulations for their use.Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., took umbrage at that fact, saying that while drones have the potential to help law enforcement agencies, constitutional rights must come first."I am concerned the FBI is deploying drone technology while only being in the 'initial stages' of developing guidelines to protect Americans' privacy rights. I look forward to learning more about this program and will do everything in my power to hold the FBI accountable and ensure its actions respect the U.S. Constitution," he said in a statement.The FBI clarified on Friday that its drone use is governed by existing bureau regulations and FAA rules. It confirmed that the specific drone model is the PUMA AE, manufactured by California firm AeroVironment. The model is hand-launched, battery-powered and can send live color and thermal video to its operator, according to the company. It is designed to respond to disasters and other incidents.The issue is likely to follow Obama's new nominee to lead the FBI, Jim Comey. Obama nominated the former federal prosecutor on Friday.Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who originally asked Mueller about the drone program, also wrote a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder on Wednesday seeking "clarification" regarding a prior response from the department that did not disclose the FBI's drones. He, too, asked Holder to explain when the FBI began using them, what checks are in place for the program and whether any are capable of being armed.FBI spokesman Paul Bresson clarified earlier this week that the aircraft are only used in "very limited circumstances to support operations where there was a specific operational need."He cited an example of a hostage situation in Alabama earlier this year where a drone helped law enforcement. He said they are only used to conduct surveillance "on stationary subjects." And the bureau must obtain FAA approval first.Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inboxSubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!

"This administration has institutionalized the practice of pitting bureaucrats against the very people they're supposed to be serving, and it needs to stop."Speaking to the same organization last year, McConnell accused the administration and Obama's re-election campaign of leaking tax information and maintaining an enemies list in a chilling style reminiscent of President Richard Nixon, the Republican who resigned in 1974 amid the Watergate scandal.In the first six months of Obama's second term, the administration's problems have produced an assortment of political targets for Republicans. One is the IRS affair, which has resulted in resignations and departures from the agency. No evidence has come to light that anyone in the Obama administration outside the IRS was involved in targeting conservative groups for extra scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status.Other issues facing the Obama administration this year include government surveillance of phone and Internet records; its handling of last year's terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, which killed four Americans; the Justice Department's seizure of phone records of journalists at the Associated Press and, in another case, reading the e-mails of Fox News reporter James Rosen.McConnell referred to the IRS episode with a bit of I-told-you-so."When I warned about all this last year, I got slammed by the usual suspects on the left. They said I was full of it," he said. "But even some of them now seem to realize that just because McConnell is the one pulling the alarm doesn't mean there isn't a fire. The IRS scandal has reminded people of the temptations to abuse that big government, and its political patrons, are prone to. People are waking up to a pattern here."In comments certain to appeal to Republican voters, McConnell described public sector unions as power hungry and able to expand their reach with the help of congressional friends. He said the unions no longer serve the public's interest but rather the government's."There's no better illustration of this than the announcement this week that in the midst of congressional hearings into their activities, unionized employees at the IRS are about to get $70 million in bonuses," McConnell said.Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said this week that the IRS plans to hand out $70 million in bonuses to employees. Under a contract with the employees' union, IRS workers can receive individual performance bonuses of up to $3,500 a year.In response to Grassley's criticism, the agency said it's under a legal obligation to comply with its collective bargaining agreement with the National Treasury Employees Union. The agency and the union say they are in negotiations over the matter.McConnell used the speech to deliver a forceful defense of the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United ruling, which lifted many restrictions on corporate spending in political elections.MOSCOW (AP) — Former National Security Agency systems analyst Edward Snowden says surveillance programs used by the United States to tap into phone and Internet connections around the world are making people less safe.In short video clips posted by the WikiLeaks website on Friday, Snowden said the NSA mass surveillance he revealed before fleeing to Russia "puts us at risk of coming into conflict with our own government."Snowden, who faces espionage charges in the U.S. over the leak, described the techniques as "dragnet mass surveillance that puts entire populations under sort of an eye that sees everything even when it's not needed.""They hurt our economy. They hurt our country. They limit our ability to speak and think and live and be creative, to have relationships and to associate freely," Snowden said.The videos are the first of Snowden speaking since July 12, when he was shown at a Moscow airport pleading with Russian authorities to grant him asylum, which they did on Aug. 1.That decision has strained the relations between the U.S. and Russia. President Barack Obama called off a meeting with President Vladimir Putin at a summit hosted by Russia in September.Snowden said the U.S. government was "unwilling to prosecute high officials who lied to Congress and the country on camera, but they'll stop at nothing to persecute someone who told them the truth."In a note accompanying the videos, WikiLeaks said Snowden spoke on Wednesday in Moscow as he accepted the Sam Adams Award, given annually by a group of retired U.S. national security officers and named for a CIA analyst during the Vietnam War who accused the U.S. military of deliberately underestimating the enemy's strength for political purposes.Four former U.S. government officials who were at the ceremony told The Associated Press on Thursday that Snowden is adjusting to life in Russia and said they saw no evidence that he was under the control of local security services. They refused to say where they met with Snowden or where he is living.A New Zealand television commentator who adopted a mock Asian accent during a post-game rugby interview on Friday is likely to keep his job despite an outpouring of public criticism.

The Oxford/AstraZeneca jab has yet to obtain approval from the US Food and Drug Administration, but production of the vaccine has started in anticipation of a green light. It was being produced by a sub-contractor at a plant operated by Emergent BioSolutions in Baltimore. The plant was also manufacturing Johnson & Johnson's vaccines and workers at the factory mistakenly mixed the ingredients. As a result 15 million doses of the vaccine produced by Johnson & Johnson, which has been given FDA approval, had to be destroyed. Johnson & Johnson will now assume full responsibility for the production of its vaccine at the plant. The pharmaceutical giant, which has promised to deliver 100 million doses of its single-shot vaccine to the US by the end of May, said it will deploy additional staff at the Baltimore plant.With no competing bloodlines or public rivalries, Jordan’s royal family have traditionally avoided the high-profile arrests, purges and coups seen in other monarchies in the Middle East. It is part of the regime's carefully-cultivated reputation as a Western-allied bastion of stability in a region often marked by chaos. But the house arrest of Prince Hamzah, and the detention of another junior member of the royal family and multiple other high-profile figures has dramatically pushed previously private rifts into the public eye. “Praying that truth and justice will prevail for all the innocent victims of this wicked slander. God bless and keep them safe,” tweeted Hamzah’s American born mother, Queen Noor, on Sunday morning. While the Jordanian government denied that Hamzah had been arrested, a video shared with the BBC by his lawyer showed the prince saying he is “not allowed to go out, to communicate with people or to meet with them, because in the meetings that I had been present in — or on social media relating to visits that I had made — there had been criticism of the government or the king.”A viral TikTok video shows a dispute with a passenger on a Southwest Airlines flight who refused to comply with COVID-19 safety protocols.Residents ordered to evacuate over fears for the pond in the Tampa Bay area, which stores 500 million gallons of water containing radium and uranium.The memorial included illustrations of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, as well as locks with the names of other people killed by police.Parents are angry after a freshman class at Cedar Hill High School in Dallas had to watch the full video of George Floyd's death for the assignment.Each mummy was carried in a glass capsule with shock-absorbers so that the ancient royals didn't get damaged during the journey to a new museum.No COVID vaccine has been authorized for use for children under 16.PALMETTO — Gov.

SPRINGFIELD --- The Senate today approved legislation that would allow doctors to prescribe medical marijuana to patients with serious illnesses, sending the measure to Gov. Pat Quinn. The issue pitted supporters arguing for compassion for those suffering from pain they say only cannabis can ease against opponents who contend the legislation would undermine public safety. Sponsoring Sen. Bill Haine, D-Alton, argued the measure is one of the toughest in the nation. Haine said his bill does not reflect other states that have "sloppily" instituted medical marijuana laws. "This bill is filled with walls to keep this limited," said Haine, a former Madison County state's attorney. Sen. Kyle McCarter, R-Lebanon, raised concerns about lawmakers endorsing a product that classified as a controlled substance by the federal government, arguing marijuana is a gateway drug that could lead users to harder substances. "For every touching story we have heard about the benefits to those in pain, I remind you today that there are a thousand time more parents who will never be relieved from the pain of losing a child due to addiction which in many cases started with the very illegal, FDA-unapproved addiction-forming drug that you are asking us to now make a normal part of our communities," McCarter said. The proposal would create a four-year trial program in which doctors could prescribe patients no more than 2.5 ounces of marijuana every two weeks. To qualify, patients must have one of 42 serious or chronic conditions -- including cancer, multiple sclerosis or HIV -- and an established relationship with a doctor. Patients would undergo fingerprinting and a criminal background check and would be banned from using marijuana in public and around minors. Patients also could not legally grow marijuana, and they would have to buy it from one of 60 dispensing centers across Illinois. The state would license 22 growers. The measure drew strong opposition from the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police and the Illinois Sheriffs' Association, which sent a letter to the governor and lawmakers warning the proposal would not stop medical marijuana card holders from driving while under the influence. They suggested blood and urine testing be included in the legislation to allow police to determine whether card holders had marijuana in their system while driving. Haine argued the law has safeguards to prevent that, including designating on a driver's license whether they use medical marijuana. The Senate vote was 35-21, with 30 needed to pass the bill. It goes to Quinn, who has not indicated whether he will sign it. The Democratic governor recently said he is open minded to the legislation.

Rep. Steve King, an Iowa Republican, has always been a bit of a melon head, but he outdid himself in an interview that came to light this week in which he described “DREAMers” — people brought to this country illegally as children — as misshapen drug mules. “For every one who’s a valedictorian, there’s another 100 out there that — they weigh 130 pounds and they’ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they’re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert,” the honorable gentleman said.Cantaloupe calves? This was a rotten tomato tossed at Latinos, who were already suspicious of Republicans before the insult was added to the injury of House conservatives such as King blocking action on bipartisan immigration legislation. “Hateful,” said House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). “Inexcusable,” said Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.). King kept on throwing. “It’s not something that I’m making up,” he told Radio Iowa on Tuesday evening, hours after a Democrat who had discovered the recent interview with Newsmax read the offending comments aloud at a congressional hearing. “We have people that are mules, that are drug mules, that are hauling drugs across the border and you can tell by their physical characteristics what they’ve been doing for months, going through the desert with 75 pounds of drugs on their back. And if those who advocate for the DREAM Act, if they choose to characterize this about valedictorians, I gave them a different image.”King certainly gave his colleagues a different image: that of a Republican Party driven into extinction in coming decades because it antagonized what is becoming the most important voting bloc. Even his usual conservative partners moved to isolate him. “Irresponsible and reprehensible,” Rep. Raul Labrador (Idaho) said at a luncheon gathering with reporters called Conversations with Conservatives. “I think what he said was out of touch with the [GOP] conference.” In lieu of a defense of King, Labrador scolded the assembled journalists for their reporting on King’s out-of-his-gourd remark but not the favorable things other Republicans say about immigrants. “Shame on you. Shame on the media,” he lectured. “Make sure that your article talks about what every Republican said,” Labrador proposed, “not what one outlier said.” This is similar to scolding the media for focusing on the one plane that crashes and not giving equal attention to all the planes that land safely. More to the point, it’s not at all clear that King is such an outlier. Certainly, his zany remarks are low-hanging fruit for journalists. Just last week, he got into a heated exchange with a Univision host who asked about a speech in which King likened immigrants to a litter of puppies. “You want a good bird dog?” he asked. “Pick the one that’s the friskiest. . . . You get the pick of the litter and you got yourself a pretty good bird dog. Well, we’ve got the pick of every donor civilization on the planet.” But if Republicans think King is a fruitcake, they don’t show it on the House floor, where last month they approved, along party lines, an amendment King offered that would force the Obama administration to resume deportation of the DREAMers who immigrated as children. “If this position holds, no amnesty will reach the president’s desk,” the congressman said in a celebratory statement after the vote. And King’s position is holding. Boehner, responding to House conservatives, is refusing to take up the Senate legislation. Because he has chosen a strategy of passing legislation through the House without Democratic votes, the speaker can’t afford to lose more than a handful of Republicans. This empowers “outliers” such as King. “The reason we’re in a bottleneck here in Congress is because of a few like him,” Rep. Rubén Hinojosa (D-Tex.), chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, told me Wednesday afternoon at a caucus event outside the Capitol. “Evidently there’s enough to be able to force the speaker of the House to stall and not be able to do this immigration reform.”Republicans say their objections to the immigration bill have nothing to do with racial or ethnic discrimination, and that’s surely the case for most of them. But King makes it easy for Democrats to tar the Republicans with sinister motives. Rep. Ben Luján (D-N.M.), one of several speakers denouncing King on the House floor Wednesday, said his slur shows why “the American people continue to see House Republicans as out of touch.”That’s not quite fair. But when one of their own is talking about cantaloupe calves, Republicans aren’t in a strong position to complain about cherry-picking.

Instead of treating 100 grams of cocaine the same as 1 gram of crack for sentencing purposes, the law cut the ratio to 18 to 1. Initially, the law applied only to future offenders, but, a year later, the United States Sentencing Commission voted to apply it retroactively. Republicans raged, charging that crime would go up and that prisoners would overwhelm the courts with frivolous demands for sentence reductions. Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa said the commission was pursuing “a liberal agenda at all costs.” This week, we began to learn that there are no costs, only benefits. According to a preliminary report released by the commission, more than 7,300 federal prisoners have had their sentences shortened under the law. The average reduction is 29 months, meaning that over all, offenders are serving roughly 16,000 years fewer than they otherwise would have. And since the federal government spends about $30,000 per year to house an inmate, this reduction alone is worth nearly half-a-billion dollars — big money for a Bureau of Prisons with a $7 billion budget. In addition, the commission found no significant difference in recidivism rates between those prisoners who were released early and those who served their full sentences. Federal judges nationwide have long expressed vigorous disagreement with both the sentencing disparity and the mandatory minimum sentences they are forced to impose, both of which have been drivers of our bloated federal prison system. But two bipartisan bills in Congress now propose a cheaper and more humane approach. It would include reducing mandatory minimums, giving judges more flexibility to sentence below those minimums, and making more inmates eligible for reductions to their sentences under the new ratio.But 18 to 1 is still out of whack. The ratio was always based on faulty science and misguided assumptions, and it still disproportionately punishes blacks, who make up more than 80 percent of those prosecuted for federal crack offenses. The commission and the Obama administration have called for a 1-to-1 ratio. The question is not whether we can afford to do it, but whether we can afford not to. AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Charlie SavageWASHINGTON — President Obama, expanding his push to curtail severe penalties in drug cases, on Thursday commuted the sentences of eight federal inmates who were convicted of crack cocaine offenses. Each inmate has been imprisoned for at least 15 years, and six were sentenced to life in prison.It was the first time retroactive relief was provided to a group of inmates who would most likely have received significantly shorter terms if they had been sentenced under current drug laws, sentencing rules and charging policies. Most will be released in 120 days. The commutations opened a major new front in the administration’s efforts to curb soaring taxpayer spending on prisons and to help correct what it has portrayed as inequality in the justice system. In a statement, Mr. Obama said that each of the eight men and women had been sentenced under what is now recognized as an “unfair system,” including a 100-to-1 sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine offenses that was significantly reduced by the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010.“If they had been sentenced under the current law, many of them would have already served their time and paid their debt to society,” Mr. Obama said. “Instead, because of a disparity in the law that is now recognized as unjust, they remain in prison, separated from their families and their communities, at a cost of millions of taxpayer dollars each year.”The commutations have come during a pendulum swing away from tough mandatory minimum sentencing laws enacted a generation ago amid the crack epidemic. The policies fueled an 800 percent increase in the number of prisoners in the United States. They also carried a racial charge: Offenses involving crack, which was disproportionately prevalent in impoverished black communities, carried far more severe penalties than those for powder cocaine, favored by affluent white users.According to Families Against Mandatory Minimums, about 8,800 federal inmates are serving time for crack offenses committed before Congress reduced mandatory minimum sentences, going forward, in the 2010 law.The commutation recipients included Clarence Aaron of Mobile, Ala., who was sentenced to three life terms in prison for his role in a 1993 drug deal, when he was 22. Mr. Aaron’s case has been taken up by civil rights groups and congressional critics of severe sentencing for nonviolent drug offenses, and has received significant news media attention. Margaret Love, his lawyer, said she received a call informing her of the decision on Thursday morning and called her client, who along with his family was “very grateful.”“He was absolutely overcome,” Ms. Love said. “Actually, I was, too. He was in tears. This has been a long haul for him, 20 years. He just was speechless, and it’s very exciting.”Rights groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, which had profiled several of the recipients in a recent report on nonviolent offenders serving life sentences, greeted the announcement with praise and calls for additional efforts. Reaction among conservatives, who in states like Texas and South Carolina have been at the forefront of efforts to reduce the mass incarceration of nonviolent offenders, was muted. The top Republicans on the House and Senate Judiciary Committees declined to comment.The commutation recipients also included Reynolds Wintersmith, of Rockford, Ill., who was 17 in 1994 when he was sentenced to life in prison for dealing crack, and Stephanie George, of Pensacola, Fla., who received a life sentence in 1997, when she was 27, for hiding a boyfriend’s stash of crack in a box in her house. In both cases, the judges criticized the mandatory sentences they were required to impose, calling them unjust.In December 2012, The New York Times published an article about Ms. George’s case and the larger rethinking of the social and economic costs of long prison terms for nonviolent offenders. Mr. Obama mentioned the article in an interview with Time magazine that day and said he was considering asking officials about ways to do things “smarter.”Around that time, a senior White House official said, Mr. Obama directed Kathryn Ruemmler, his White House counsel, to ask the Justice Department to examine pending clemency petitions to assess whether there were any in which current inmates serving long sentences would have benefited from subsequent changes to sentencing laws and policy.The deputy attorney general, James M. Cole, who oversees the pardon office, worked on the policy shift and ultimately returned the eight cases with positive recommendations from the department, the official said.In 2010, there was bipartisan support in Congress for reducing the disparity in sentences between crack and powder cocaine, against a backdrop of crime rates that have plunged to the lowest levels in four decades. And in August, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. instructed prosecutors to omit listing any quantities of illicit substances in indictments for low-level drug offenses in order to avoid triggering mandatory minimum sentences. But those moves have left unanswered what, if anything, to do about federal inmates serving lengthy sentences for crack offenses committed before the Fair Sentencing Act.A bill co-sponsored by Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, and Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, would make the Fair Sentencing Act retroactive for some offenders, allowing inmates to apply to a judge for a review of whether a reduced sentence would be appropriate. The Obama administration supports that bill, the White House said on Thursday, as an orderly way to ensure case-by-case analysis in addressing the broader problem. “In the new year, lawmakers should act on the kinds of bipartisan sentencing reform measures already working their way through Congress,” Mr. Obama said. “Together, we must ensure that our taxpayer dollars are spent wisely, and that our justice system keeps its basic promise of equal treatment for all.”Mr. Obama, who has made relatively little use of his constitutional clemency powers to forgive offenses or reduce sentences, also pardoned 13 people who completed their sentences long ago. Those cases involved mostly minor offenses, in line with his previous pardons.AdvertisementDiscover Thomson ReutersAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

For Cristian, this will mean that instead of hiding his plants from the police, the authorities will supervise them to make sure he complies with the new rules.A central body, the National Institute for Cannabis Regulation, will provide those who want to grow marijuana with seeds and ensure that their crop does not exceed the legal limit of 480g (1lb 1oz) per year.Cristian welcomes the change."I think it was about time that cannabis became legal. Police should worry about fighting crime and drug trafficking, not me," he says.The man behind the law is 78-year-old former guerrilla fighter turned President Jose Mujica.The president says he opposes drug consumption but wants to take the multi-million-dollar cannabis business away from the drug cartels. "This won't be a weed-for-all country," Mr Mujica assured critics.Under the new law, buyers will have to officially register - something only residents can do, not tourists.There will also be a strict 40g/month limit on those who grow the drug or buy it at licensed pharmacies."What I am doing is offering consumers a legal amount," President Mujica explains. The bill goes several steps further than existing legislation in the Netherlands, where growing cannabis is not legal, although the authorities turn a blind eye to those who grow some plants at home.It bears some similarities to drug laws in the US states of Colorado and Washington, where the sale of cannabis for medicinal or recreational use was made legal in 2012.But Uruguay is the first nation state to regulate the production, distribution and sale of the drug. The country, which has a population of fewer than 3.5 million people, has so far been spared much of the drug-related violence that other Latin American countries have suffered from, but officials say it is time to tackle drug gangs before they get too strong."Last year, 82 people were killed in drug-related violence in Uruguay. We are starting to see episodes of criminal score-settling, groups of hitmen ... but we are not aware of anybody who died because of marijuana consumption," explains the head of the National Drug Agency, Julio Calzada.Other Latin American countries are watching Uruguay's experiment with interest.Guatemalan President Otto Perez Molina, whose country is suffering from a wave of violence blamed on drug cartels, has described his Uruguayan counterpart as "a visionary".Others view Mr Mujica's experiment with scepticism.Mexican Foreign Minister Jose Antonio Meade recently warned that "unilateral policies" would not solve the problem, and asked for a global discussion about drug policy.Uruguay's neighbour Brazil sent a delegation to Montevideo earlier this year to express its concern about the potential impact of the new law.But Mr Calzada insists Uruguay's neighbours will benefit as well as its own citizens. "Our commitment to other countries is that our legal marijuana will not end up smuggled into their territory. This will not happen," he assures foreign sceptics.But the law is also facing criticism at home. According to recent polls, 60% of Uruguayans oppose the bill. Congresswoman Veronica Alonso of the National Party is one of them."This law does not solve the real problems. If the government really wants to fight insecurity it should tackle the places where illegal drugs are sold," she told the BBC."If it is a matter of public health, then it should work to prevent the consumption of other drugs, like tobacco or alcohol," she argues.Ms Alonso fears that the law will encourage drug consumption, especially among young Uruguayans."There will be a higher availability of marijuana and at the same time the perception of marijuana as a dangerous drug will be lower. Therefore consumption will grow," she says."This is going to cause us a lot of problems, especially from a social and medical point of view, and the State is not ready to face them."Whether good or bad, the effects of the government's pioneering move are certain to be scrutinised and analysed by both opponents and supporters of cannabis legalisation not just in Uruguay but across the world.Mexico's mellow vibe on drug legalisationUruguay's cannabis bill reflects liberal pastUruguay MPs back marijuana billJordan: Prince Hamzah plotted against kingdomThe king's half-brother sought to mobilise tribal leaders against the government, the deputy PM says.France enters third lockdown as ICU numbers surgeState of emergency over Florida toxic water leak'We found a baby on the subway - now he's our son'Long lost pen pals reunited after 70 years.

Among the changes: Ending waivers for states that during the recession allowed as many as 4 million people to collect food stamps who otherwise would not have qualified.The fate of the congressional legislation is uncertain. The Senate approved much smaller reductions, and the White House threatened to veto any large cuts to food stamps.But in six states—Delaware, Kansas, New Hampshire, Utah, Vermont and Wyoming—similar reductions are already in place, or soon will be. Two more states will join them once their waivers expire, potentially taking away food stamps from tens of thousands of current recipients.Republicans blame the program's ever-increasing rolls and cost on lax enrollment criteria rather than real need. Since before the recession, the price tag for food stamps has more than doubled, topping $82.5 billion in fiscal year 2013. Enrollment hit record highs, with 15 percent of Americans now collecting benefits. Many states have more than 20 percent of their population enrolled.Costs have continued to spike as well, as Washington pays for the benefits and states administer them. A new Congressional Research Service report released this month showed fiscal year 2012 was the 12th year in a row a new historical high was reached for federal food and nutrition programs, the vast majority of which is food stamps. Since fiscal year 2000, the report said, spending on federal food assistance has more than tripled.Put in a different context, the U.S. Census Bureau said food stamps lifted 4 million Americans out of poverty last year if the benefits were counted as income.What states are doingKansas is the latest to embrace the cuts, ending a federal waiver on Oct. 1 that allows unemployed, non-elderly and able-bodied adults without children to remain on food stamps despite failing to meet certain work requirements. The change is expected to affect 20,000 Kansans. Wisconsin will let its waiver expire in July 2014, and Oklahoma will also let its waiver at the end of this month; 71,000 and 47,000 people, respectively, received benefits through the waiver in 2011, the latest year for which data is available.The waivers, part of the 1996 welfare reform, were designed to give states flexibility in times of high unemployment. It suspends a requirement that limits benefits to three months unless recipients work 20 hours a week or spend a certain amount of time on work-related activities, such as job training.Until this year, 45 states took advantage of the waiver during the recession, and two that did not – Vermont and New Hampshire – weren't eligible for statewide coverage, which is based on unemployment and job market data. Delaware and Utah chose not to request a waiver, while Wyoming wasn't eligible.Many Republican-led states are trimming safety nets as the recession wanes. In addition, food stamp benefits for all recipients are set to fall Nov. 1 when federal stimulus money ends. Some states have changed welfare enrollment criteria. Others enacted unprecedented cuts in unemployment insurance, as Stateline previously reported.Against that backdrop, supporters of the cuts see the work requirement as a prime opportunity to trim the rolls. Those possibly affected by ending the waivers comprise less than 5 percent of Americans collecting food stamps.Republicans see the improving economy as a sign enrollment should be dropping anyway, with cuts to benefits a good way to push some people back into the labor market. Kansas made its case clear, calling the policy "an effort to encourage employment over welfare dependency.""Employment is the most effective way to escape poverty," Kansas Department of Children and Families Secretary Phyllis Gilmore said in a statement announcing the move.Those who support ending the waivers also promise robust job placement and training programs to help those affected meet work requirements, which could allow them to keep their benefits. Wisconsin, for example, is spending an additional $33 million on those efforts as its waiver expires.Are cuts premature?Others say the cuts are premature in the face of a weak job market— 11 states and the District of Columbia have unemployment rates measurably higher than the national 7.3 percent jobless rate. The waivers are designed to end once employment improves. Ending them sooner could strip flexibility to deal with lingering joblessness, which is expected to remain above normal for years."It's hard to imagine any state would want to lose the flexibility to use waivers to tailor the policy to meet local conditions," said Dottie Rosenbaum, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank. Rosenbaum added that the work-requirement policy can have "harsh effects on very poor individuals."Underlying the debate is the question of whether policies enacted during the recession have increased enrollment levels beyond actual need. Critics cite the outsized growth of food stamps compared with other safety net programs during the recession.Projections paint a bleak picture. The Congressional Budget Office estimates more than 43 million will collect food stamp benefits in 2017, just 4 million fewer than today. By 2022, the CBO estimates enrollment will be 9 million more than pre-recession levels and total spending will be nearly $73 billion—more than double than it was in 2007.Stateline is a nonpartisan, nonprofit news service of the Pew Charitable Trusts that provides daily reporting and analysis on trends in state policy. This Friday, Dec. 13, 2013 photo shows a view of a Macy's flagship store in New York. Claims over racial profiling at department stores in New York have helped expose the practice in more than 40 states of retailers holding shoplifting suspects and assessing fines, even if a person hasn’t yet technically stolen anything. At Macy’s flagship store, suspects are held in cells, asked to sign an admission of guilt and pay hundreds in fines. (AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews)NEW YORK (AP) -- Outside the view of paying customers, people accused of shoplifting at Macy's huge flagship store are escorted by security guards to cells in "Room 140," where they can be held for hours, asked to sign an admission of guilt and pay hundreds in fines, sometimes without any conclusive proof they stole anything.As shoppers jam stores ahead of the December holidays, claims of racial profiling at department stores in New York have helped expose the wide latitude that laws in at least 27 states give retailers to hold and fine shoplifting suspects, even if a person hasn't yet technically stolen anything, is wrongly accused or criminal charges are dropped."You must remember, these people are not police officers; they are store employees," said Faruk Usar, the attorney for a 62-year-old Turkish woman who sued Macy's, which some customers say bullied them into paying fines on the spot or harassed them with letters demanding payment. "When they are detained, they are not yet even in a real jail."Industrywide, more than $12 billion is lost to shoplifting each year. The laws, which vary on strictness and fine amounts, allow stores to try to recoup some losses. Under New York's longstanding law, retailers may collect a penalty of five times the cost of the stolen merchandise, up to $500 per item, plus as much as $1,500 if the merchandise isn't in a condition to be sold. A conviction is not necessary to bring a civil claim.Some customers say stores have harassed them into signing admissions of guilt in order to turn a profit — not just recoup a loss.Retailers don't divulge how much money they recoup but use it in part to offset security costs, said Barbara Staib, spokeswoman for the National Association for Shoplifting Prevention. The total is a fraction of what they lose, she said."We tend to forget that retailers are the victims of crime when it comes to shoplifting," she said.But at least nine customers at the Macy's store immortalized in "Miracle on 34th Street" say in lawsuits that the retailer is abusing the law, wrongly targeting minorities and holding customers for hours, years after it settled similar claims brought by the state attorney general by paying a $600,000 fine and changing practices. That agreement expired in 2008.New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is investigating the new claims against retailers. Last week, New York state stores agreed to post a customer "bill of rights" on their websites explicitly prohibiting profiling and unreasonable searches.Usar's client, Ayla Gursoy, was detained in 2010 after she carried two coats in her arms up several flights of stairs in the flagship store, according to her suit. Store security accused Gursoy, who speaks little English, of trying to steal. She was asked to sign a form admitting guilt and pay a fine. She refused, the police were called and she was arrested.Gursoy and others say they were held for hours in Room 140, a bare room with two small, barred holding cells with wooden benches within the store.Elina Kazan, a spokeswoman for Cincinnati-based Macy's, said the company's practices prohibit coercion when recovering fines."Our policy of exercising our right to pursue a civil recovery payment is consistent with common practice in the retail industry and within the parameters of the law," she said.Many retailers detain suspected shoplifters, industry experts said, but few have dedicated jail cells and most don't ask for payments on the spot like Macy's.Most of the accused receive letters in the mail demanding payment from a law firm like the one used by Macy's, Palmer, Reifler & Associates, of Orlando, Fla. That firm also represents Home Depot, Wal-Mart and many other stores and sends out about 115,000 letters per month."We are confident in our clients' training processes and procedures for evaluating and investigating theft matters," attorney Natt Reifler said.Letters sent to Gursoy said that if she didn't pay, she would be sued. One said she owed $400; the next said she owed $675 — the increase unexplained."We believe the whole purpose of her detention was to get the signature, to get the payments," Usar said shortly before his client's suit was settled in court Dec. 4. The terms were not disclosed. Her criminal charge was dismissed after no witness could testify.In San Leandro, Calif., Jimin Chen accused Home Depot in a federal lawsuit of abusing the laws by shaking down customers to make an extra profit.He said he was stopped in September by a security guard there who falsely accused him of trying to steal work gloves worth $3.99 that he had taken off the shelves and worn to load lumber into his cart. He said he was detained until he signed an admission of guilt.Later, he started receiving letters demanding money; $350, then $675. Home Depot disputes the claims and has asked for dismissal.Lawyers say that retailers rarely actually sue for the money, and they often suggest letter recipients don't bother paying because refusing won't affect their credit.Generally, industry experts say, the laws allowing retailers to hold and fine suspected shoplifters are applied correctly."Retailers do a really good job of identifying where actual theft cases have occurred, and intervening and conducting investigations," said Joseph LaRocca, who runs RetaiLPartners, an industry group aimed at building partnerships between retailers and law enforcement. "There are always exceptions, but by and large, there are few mistakes here."The racial profiling allegations started in New York this fall with a different retailer, Barneys New York, after two black customers said they were stopped while buying expensive merchandise. The retailer has said it does not profile, and neither customer was asked to sign a confession or pay a fine.But the allegations grew to include Macy's. Among those complaining was Rob Brown of the HBO show "Treme," who said he was stopped after buying a $1,300 Movado watch for his mother this summer.Brown, 29, said he too was taken to Room 140. There, he said in a federal suit filed by attorney Doug Wigdor, others being held were all "individuals of color." He was released, he said, when people realized he was a celebrity.Kazan, of Macy's, said she couldn't comment on pending litigation.___Associated Press news researcher Rhonda Shafner contributed to this report.A New Zealand television commentator who adopted a mock Asian accent during a post-game rugby interview on Friday is likely to keep his job despite an outpouring of public criticism.

The Oxford/AstraZeneca jab has yet to obtain approval from the US Food and Drug Administration, but production of the vaccine has started in anticipation of a green light. It was being produced by a sub-contractor at a plant operated by Emergent BioSolutions in Baltimore. The plant was also manufacturing Johnson & Johnson's vaccines and workers at the factory mistakenly mixed the ingredients. As a result 15 million doses of the vaccine produced by Johnson & Johnson, which has been given FDA approval, had to be destroyed. Johnson & Johnson will now assume full responsibility for the production of its vaccine at the plant. The pharmaceutical giant, which has promised to deliver 100 million doses of its single-shot vaccine to the US by the end of May, said it will deploy additional staff at the Baltimore plant.With no competing bloodlines or public rivalries, Jordan’s royal family have traditionally avoided the high-profile arrests, purges and coups seen in other monarchies in the Middle East. It is part of the regime's carefully-cultivated reputation as a Western-allied bastion of stability in a region often marked by chaos. But the house arrest of Prince Hamzah, and the detention of another junior member of the royal family and multiple other high-profile figures has dramatically pushed previously private rifts into the public eye. “Praying that truth and justice will prevail for all the innocent victims of this wicked slander. God bless and keep them safe,” tweeted Hamzah’s American born mother, Queen Noor, on Sunday morning. While the Jordanian government denied that Hamzah had been arrested, a video shared with the BBC by his lawyer showed the prince saying he is “not allowed to go out, to communicate with people or to meet with them, because in the meetings that I had been present in — or on social media relating to visits that I had made — there had been criticism of the government or the king.”A viral TikTok video shows a dispute with a passenger on a Southwest Airlines flight who refused to comply with COVID-19 safety protocols.Residents ordered to evacuate over fears for the pond in the Tampa Bay area, which stores 500 million gallons of water containing radium and uranium.The memorial included illustrations of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, as well as locks with the names of other people killed by police.Parents are angry after a freshman class at Cedar Hill High School in Dallas had to watch the full video of George Floyd's death for the assignment.Each mummy was carried in a glass capsule with shock-absorbers so that the ancient royals didn't get damaged during the journey to a new museum.No COVID vaccine has been authorized for use for children under 16.PALMETTO — Gov.

BlowAlong with — and because of — dramatic social and demographic changes, America is quickly dividing itself into two separate nations, regional enclaves of rigid politics, as the idea of common national priorities fades further into a distant past.Rich Morin, a senior editor at the Pew Research Center, wrote about a new study on public opinion on Wednesday and found that:“Americans often say they want their representatives in Congress to put the country’s needs over local concerns. But four novel experiments suggest that the public does just the opposite.”He continued:“Respondents rated a member of Congress far more favorably if the lawmaker put the interests of his or her district or state over those of the country as a whole.”He concluded, in part, with this damning line:“The study’s author says legislators who ‘nobly’ put national preferences ahead of local ones will be punished by constituents.”Here’s why this is so problematic: on a state level, and even on a county and community level, we as a country continue to self-sort into ideological islands.According to the author Bill Bishop, who in 2008 published “The Big Sort: Why the Clustering of Like-Minded America is Tearing Us Apart”:“In 1976, only about a quarter of America’s voters lived in a county a presidential candidate won by a landslide margin. By 2004, it was nearly half.”And the country’s seismic demographic and cultural shifts threaten to make our tribalism permanent.There has been the rapid rise of minority populations and stagnation in the growth of the non-Hispanic white population in this country. Now, non-whites represent a majority of all births in America, and last week The New York Times reported on census data that revealed that “deaths exceeded births among non-Hispanic white Americans for the first time in at least a century.”In fact, according to an Associated Press report last week, which cited government reports: “For the first time, America’s racial and ethnic minorities now make up about half of the under-5 age group.”But there were also some worrisome statistics in the report that could help to signal those children’s views on policy. According to the report: “Black toddlers were most likely to be poor, at 41 percent, followed by Hispanics at 32 percent and whites at 13 percent. Asian toddlers had a poverty rate of 11 percent.”As a Pew Research Center report found in 2009, while top earners (those earning $100,000 or more) were almost evenly split among Democrats, independents and Republicans, the lowest earners (those making $20,000 or less) were more than twice as likely to be Independents than Republicans, and were nearly three times as likely to be Democrats than Republicans.Furthermore, what constitutes a family and who is seen as the head of that family has also changed. According to a March report titled “Knot Yet,” which was sponsored by The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, the Relate Institute and The National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia:“By age 25, 44 percent of women have had a baby, while only 38 percent have married; by the time they turn 30, about two-thirds of American women have had a baby, typically out of wedlock. Over all, 48 percent of first births are to unmarried women, most of them in their 20s.”In fact, the report found that “for women as a whole, the median age at first birth (25.7) now falls before the median age at first marriage (26.5), a phenomenon we call ‘The Great Crossover.’ ”But in almost every case, the states that went for Barack Obama in 2012 had the higher ages of first marriage, and the ones that went for Mitt Romney had lower ones.It would stand to reason that attacks on contraception and a full range of family planning options — including a woman’s right to an abortion — might be viewed differently by these families.And, we are becoming less blindly religious and more blindly militaristic. (The former is a good thing; the latter, not so much.)According to Gallup, the percentage of Americans saying that they have quite a lot or a great deal of confidence in “the church or organized religion” went from 68 percent in 1975 to 48 percent in 2013. Over the same period, those expressing the same amount of confidence in the military has gone from 58 percent to 76 percent.This means that on the moral front, more liberal views — like support for same-sex marriage — are allowed to quickly spread and have gone from being seen as radical to mainstream. But even on this issue, we are becoming two Americas: one where same-sex marriage is legal in some states and another where it’s specifically outlawed.But on the military front, it means that revelations about recent government snooping on Americans doesn’t sound as many alarms as it should have. Politically, it also means that some of the old ideological battle lines on national security have been scrambled so that Republicans no longer get all the credit, nor Democrats all the blame.These new realities have changed the conversation about the role and size of government, about the line between individual liberty and the collective good, about the meaning of personal responsibility and societal responsibility.They have also signaled that conservative arguments on many of these issues are losing their resonance nationally, and that the Republican pool of potential voters is shrinking while the Democratic pool expands.So, to defend themselves, their ways of thinking (and, to their minds, their way of life), Republicans are pulling every lever to slow the change on the state level — gerrymandering, limiting voter access, passing anti-immigrant laws, cutting assistance to the poor.This means we’re now at a point where people may not worry as much about all of America as about their slice of America. In the tumult and transition of change, we may be becoming a nation divided against itself.AdvertisementSectionsTVFeaturedMore from NBC Follow NBC News Latest news from around the globe."I wasn't investigating this, and if it wasn't my grandfather, I wouldn't have looked into it," Silvia Foti said."Who would have believed that the regime would kill its own people with chemicals and warplanes?"

But its ultimatum did not change any legislators’ minds. The 8 to 5 roll call matched the outcome of an earlier vote on the matter, taken before Wal-Mart’s warning.“The question here is a living wage; it’s not whether Wal-Mart comes or stays,” said council member Vincent B. Orange (D-At Large), a lead backer of the legislation, who added that the city did not need to kowtow to threats. “We’re at a point where we don’t need retailers. Retailers need us.”Whether or not Wal-Mart needs the District, it had spent the past three years wanting to enter the city in a way no other business had. Activists celebrated Wednesday’s vote, saying the company, which reported net income of $17 billion on sales of $470 billion in its most recent fiscal year, could afford to pay better wages. But the council action threatens to halt several developments anchored by Wal-Mart in neighborhoods long under­served.“Nothing has changed from our perspective,” Wal-Mart spokesman Steven Restivo said in a statement after the vote, reiterating that the company will abandon plans for three unbuilt stores and “review the financial and legal implications” of not opening three others under construction.The company’s strategy had to this point been calibrated to avoid political conflicts in a city of liberal sentiment, where the retailer’s earlier entreaties had been met with deep skepticism.Well before it had any solid plans to open stores in the District, Wal-Mart joined the D.C. Chamber of Commerce and began making inroads with politicians, community groups and local charities that work on anti-hunger initiatives.The campaign was matched with cash. Through its charitable foundation, Wal-Mart made $3.8 million in donations last year to city organizations including D.C. Central Kitchen and the Capitol Area Food Bank, according to a company spokesman. Meanwhile, it has kept a prominent local lobbyist, David W. Wilmot, on a $10,000-a-month retainer to smooth relations with elected officials.The company has not disclosed what it has spent on plans and designs for its six D.C. stores, but development and retail experts say it is probably in the hundreds of thousands of dollars and possibly as high as $1 million per location. Some of the stores have undergone major design changes since they were first announced.Should the bill be signed by Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D) and pass a congressional review period, retailers with corporate sales of $1 billion or more and operating in spaces 75,000 square feet or larger would be required to pay employees no less than $12.50 an hour. The city’s minimum wage is $8.25, a dollar higher than the federal minimum wage.The vote sets up a high-profile veto decision for Gray, who has supported Wal-Mart’s entry into the city, arguing that the company would bring badly needed jobs and retail stores to neighborhoods in need of both. The three stores that the company has pledged definitively not to pursue are all in the city’s eastern half, in areas largely devoid of quality retail.Gray made a particular push to have Wal-Mart anchor a development at Skyland Town Center, a site along Alabama Avenue SE near the mayor’s home that has long been eyed by city leaders for renewal.Gary D. Rappaport, the project’s developer, has said Wal-Mart’s withdrawal would put those plans on ice. “If there’s not a Wal-Mart at Skyland, then Skyland is not able to go forward at this time,” he said late Tuesday.The mayor initially called Wal-Mart’s announcement of its ultimatum “immensely discouraging” and said much the same in a letter to council members delivered Wednesday morning. “It is clear that numerous issues remain unclear about the impact of the bill on the District’s current economic development renaissance,” he wrote.Gray, who has met recently with Wal-Mart representatives, reiterated “serious concerns over the lost jobs and retail opportunities for District residents that the bill will cause,” in a statement released after the council vote.Before this week, Wal-Mart had made statements opposing the bill but had not directly threatened to withdraw from its plans.Seven years ago, when the retailer moved to open its first store in Chicago and the City Council there passed a similar “living-wage” measure, the company indicated then that the bill would cause it to scale back or entirely scrap its plans to open several stores, Mayor Richard M. Daley vetoed the bill, and the council failed to override it.The debate over the living-wage bill has been highly pitched, echoing conflicts elsewhere in the country over similar measures targeting Wal-Mart and other “big box” retailers.Several dozen pro-Wal-Mart protesters rallied on the front steps of the John A. Wilson Building on Wednesday, while inside a larger group of living-wage supporters walked from council office to council office hoping to pick up additional votes.“If you allow a bully to bully you, it’s never going to end,” said the Rev. Graylan Hagler, the senior pastor of Plymouth Congregational United Church of Christ and a leader of pro-living-wage group Respect DC. “There will be something else. There will always be another agenda.”Hagler and union supporters hailed what they called the council’s resolve in the face of Wal-Mart’s warning but acknowledged that fending off a mayoral veto could prove difficult. “We’ve got some work to do,” he said.Council member Yvette M. Alexander (D-Ward 7) said the company’s threats were credible and constituted her “worst nightmare.” She moved unsuccessfully to table the bill Wednesday before voting against it.“This legislation is a development killer,” she said. “This legislation is a jobs killer.”Orange, early in the debate, said the “District has arrived” as a desirable place for major retailers to locate. But council member Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4), a mayoral candidate, said that was not true throughout the city. “When I go to Skyland, we have not arrived,” she said. “That project has been some 20 years in the waiting.”Voting in favor of the bill were Orange, Chairman Phil Mendelson (D), David Grosso (I-At Large), Anita Bonds (D-At Large), Jim Graham (D-Ward 1), Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), Kenyan R. McDuffie (D-Ward 5) and Marion Barry (D-Ward 8). Voting against were Alexander, Bowser, David A. Catania (I-At Large), Mary M. Cheh (D-Ward 3) and Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6).

Council has forced our hand - Wal-Mart says it will pull out of D.C. plans should city mandate ‘living wage’ With all the excitement over Syria last week -- we went from "Assad is Hitler" to "we have achieved peace in our time" almost overnight! -- you may have missed another big story. The IRS scandal, which has slumbered over the summer as Congress has been in recess, seems to be waking up.It has now been over four months since the IRS admitted it was targeting conservative groups in the run-up to the 2012 election. The chief IRS official in charge of Exempt Organizations, Lois Lerner, has "taken the Fifth" -- invoking her right against self-incrimination in order to avoid testifying before Congress on what went on. Nonetheless, President Obama -- who himself "joked" about auditing his enemies -- has lumped the IRS misconduct in with what he calls "phony scandals."But new emails have come out that make the IRS scandal look anything but phony. Emails recovered by the House Ways and Means Committee demonstrate that the targeting of Tea Party groups -- and of voter-integrity groups -- was orchestrated from the top of the agency. Rather than being conducted by a few rogue employees in the Cincinnati office of the IRS, the Tea Party targeting was regarded by Lerner as something "very dangerous" politically, and she observed that "Cincy should probably NOT have these cases."The emails also reveal Lerner's concerns that the Democrats might lose their Senate majority, and her hopes that the Federal Election Commission might "save the day" by interfering with right-leaning grassroots activity. The IRS also shared information with the FEC, something not permitted by statute, raising questions about just how politicized both agencies were.An editorial in Investor's Business Dailyobserves:"Like the Internet video the Benghazi terrorist attack was blamed on, the only thing phony about the IRS scandal is the administration's cover story that a couple of rogue agents in the Cincinnati office concocted and executed this most blatant abuse of power by the most powerful and feared agency of government. Lerner's email further blows out of the water that discredited fiction. It also confirms a suspected reason for the planned intimidation and hamstringing of conservative opposition to the Obama administration's policies, saying that those Tea Party group applications for tax-exempt status could end up being the 'vehicle to go to court' to get more clarity on the 2010 Supreme Court ruling on campaign finance rules."That's right, and that's just another reason why we need to get to the bottom of the IRS scandal, which isn't the least bit "phony." It seems to me that there are two possible problems here. One is that this came from the Obama White House. The other is that the -- overwhelmingly Democratic -- career civil service at the IRS didn't need White House instructions to go after Tea Party groups it saw as enemies.The first possibility is bad enough, but is presumably remediable with stricter rules. The second possibility, however, calls into question the possibility of a nonpartisan career civil service, and certainly the possibility of fair administration for something as complex, and involving as many discretionary decisions, as the Internal Revenue Code. Worse yet, given that overwhelming partisan identification with Democrats pervades the civil service as a whole, it calls into question the very possibility of a nonpartisan and politically neutral civil service.I'm not ready to call for a return to the "spoils system," but the fully politicized federal bureaucracy of our nation's first century or so did have two advantages: First, presidents couldn't hide behind the bureaucracy, as they were presumed responsible for the actions of government bureaus staffed with their supporters; and second, politicians were less inclined to trust the bureaucracy with enormous and discretionary power when they knew that it would sometimes be staffed by their political adversaries.At any rate, it all boils down to trust. One reason for the resonance of not only the IRS scandals but also the NSA scandal, the Benghazi scandal, Fast and Furious, and so on is that fewer Americans than ever trust the federal government. It's a mess that needs to be cleaned up, and denying that the mess exists only exacerbates the lack of trust.It's doubtful that Eric Holder's Justice Department -- which is even more partisan and politicized than the IRS -- will clean this mess up. Nor is Holder likely to appoint a special prosecutor. So it's up to congressional investigators to get to the bottom of it.

Valentine’s Day is also a day when people with crazy ex-boyfriends or -girlfriends are reminded of how thankful they are for anti-stalking laws.Every state has made stalking a crime. These laws help protect people who might otherwise live in fear. Yet labor unions have successfully, and disconcertingly, lobbied to be exempt from anti-stalking laws in at least four states – California, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Nevada.“The most glaring examples of union favoritism under state laws,” notes a 2012 U.S. Chamber of Commerce report, “tend to occur in criminal statutes and allow individuals who engage in truly objectionable behavior to avoid prosecution solely because they are participating in some form of labor activity.”Pennsylvania unions now enjoy a loophole that the state’s anti-stalking law “shall not apply to conduct by a party to a labor dispute.” In Illinois, anti-stalking laws exempt “any controversy concerning wages, salaries, hours, working conditions or benefits … the making of collective bargaining agreements.”These exemptions prove that organizing tactics used by unions can have something in common with those of stalkers – and can perhaps inflict similar emotional distress.While a number of states have exemptions that have allowed union members to intimidate and harass, California is by far the worst actor. As in other states, it is a crime in California to interfere with a lawful business through physical obstruction or intimidation of workers or customers.Yet California has exempted unions from this law. The negative effects were clear in 2008, when United Food and Commercial Workers Union members picketed a new Ralph’s grocery store in Fresno. They went beyond traditional picketing, harassing customers and instigating confrontations with employees on store property. When store workers finally called the police, authorities refused to come and put a stop to the union’s disruptive behavior.With the nation’s highest income and sales tax rates, in addition to many costly regulations, California is already one of the most difficult places to do business. Its exemptions permitting such behavior on the part of unions – which would be considered criminal for you or me – makes the state an even more inhospitable place to do business.California also has a host of exemptions that allow union members to violate the property rights of private citizens. The 2008 Researcher Protection Act makes entering the residences of academic researchers to interfere with their work a crime. Sounds reasonable. Yet this doesn’t apply to union members. They can invade a professor’s home in California and it’s not a crime – so long as the invader is “engaged in labor union activities.”You might wonder why unions have lobbied to be exempt from laws against trespassing. The fact is that they have a long history of targeting private residences. In 2010 roughly 500 protesters from the Service Employees International Union showed up outside the home of a Bank of America deputy general counsel to protest the company’s policies. That bank official wasn’t home, but his teenage son was – and felt forced to barricade himself in a bathroom as union demonstrators surrounded his house and even came onto the front porch.Unions can also invade your personal space if you’re riding public transit in California. The California Penal Code states “willfully blocking the free movement of another person” in a public transit system is a crime subject to up to 90 days in jail and a $400 fine. However, California legislators have passed a provision exempting unions. This means that union protesters can block the movement of people on public transit so long as it is related to collective bargaining efforts – something to keep in mind before getting on BART during your next visit to San Francisco.Labor bosses have even deemed it necessary to get legislators to grant unions exemptions from laws against sabotage. Wisconsin’s state law against sabotage exempts unions, so as to not curtail their organizing activities. The fact that anti-sabotage laws might be construed as an impediment to union organizing says more about union organizing efforts than anything else.Yet, in 2011, union members were alleged to have sabotaged equipment belonging to supporters of Governor Scott Walker’s labor reforms. In New York and New Jersey, during a labor dispute between Verizon and the Communications Workers of America, the telephone company contacted the FBI to investigate allegations of sabotage. The company reported equipment being stolen, fiber-optic lines cut and an office heating system tampered with.During a union organizing effort in Ohio, the owner of one non-union electrical services company had his tires slashed and rocks thrown at his windows. One of his employees was assaulted. The owner was himself shot in the arm while confronting a person who was vandalizing his car on his property. Other owners of non-union shops experienced similar harassment and intimidation. When the Associated Builders and Contractors called on unions to halt such odious behavior, the unions responded that their actions were perfectly legal.State lawmakers should oppose efforts to exempt unions from anti-stalking and anti-trespassing laws. Where such laws are already on the books, they should be repealed. For union bosses can be like those scary exes who insist they aren’t letting you break up with them.Workers and employers deserve the freedom to tell unions, “I’m just not that into you.” PHOTO: Striking Vons worker talks to a potential customer outside a supermarket in San Diego, California, on November 26, 2003.

And they suffer no sanctions from the NLRB.Great Piece.  I still think you should change the “Twin” photos Reuters.What claptrap.  A bunch of laws, out of the context which they refer to, and piled high with childish assertions.  This desperate attempt to smear unions is nothing more than fear-mongering from the most biased of commentators.Grover should be hiding shame-faced, after his disgraceful attempts to hamstring legislators with the asinine no-tax pledge.Shame“With the nation’s highest income and sales tax rates, in addition to many costly regulations, California is already one of the most difficult places to do business.

This year, the unemployed have received 14 to 47 weeks of emergency benefits, depending on their state's jobless rate, NELP figures show.Those benefits are slated to end Dec. 28, abruptly cutting off payments to the 1.3 million people already receiving them and ensuring that another 850,000 will get no more checks when their 26 weeks of state benefits expire between January and March.By some measures, the labor market has improved, with unemployment falling to 7.3% last month from a peak of 10% in October 2009. But long-term unemployment has come down only modestly, with 4.1 million Americans, or 36% of all the unemployed, out of work at least six months. They would be the most affected by a phaseout of emergency benefits."There's still a crisis of long-term unemployment," says NELP program director Maurice Emsellem.The portion of the long-term unemployed receiving benefits has fallen to 34% from 45% a year ago, and would drop to 25% if the emergency program is shut down, NELP says.The move also would reduce economic growth next year by 0.15 percentage points, says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics. Each dollar the government pays out in benefits yields $1.42 in economic output because the unemployed tend to spend nearly all their payments, he says.The economy has grown at a relatively weak annual rate of 2.1% in the first three quarters of this year.Zandi says renewing the extended benefits program is somewhat less likely this year because there's no directly relevant bill, such as the fiscal cliff package, to which the measure could be attached.Greenstein says it could be added to anticipated budget or Medicare legislation. The White House recently urged Congress to extend the program and last week Democratic members of the House Ways and Means Committee called for a hearing on the issue.Candace Stewart, 58, says she would have to sell her townhouse if she lost her emergency benefits of about $400 week. Stewart, who was laid off from her job as a quality control inspector last April, has sent out nearly 200 résumés but gotten just two interviews."There's just nothing out there to get," she says.Do Not Sell Will you notice an immediate effect? Not likely.  For the most part, the ramifications would kick in over months, not several days or weeks.  "By [April], government agencies will execute reduced work schedules and the budget crunch will become more acute," Sean West, U.S. policy director for the Eurasia Group, explained in a research note. "The pain will pick up speed from there."  Of course, anyone directly affected will feel the cuts right away. But the general public's awareness may be delayed and uneven. Different cuts will create different domino effects, according to longtime budget expert Stan Collender.  For instance, a government worker facing a furlough may think twice about buying a new car, whereas a federal contractor getting less business from Uncle Sam may not make new hires. Summer travelers may be surprised to face reduced hours at national parks or increased delays at airports.  The exact timeline of how the so-called sequester will unfold is still unclear. And lawmakers may eventually agree to replace the cuts. But here's what we know now.  (Related: Obama order triggers cuts)  Friday, March 1 - Sequester goes into effect: The White House budget office will issue an official sequestration order that cancels $85 billion in spending authority for the seven months remaining in the fiscal year. It will also submit a report to Congress detailing the level of cuts each agency must make to its programs, projects and activities.  March 1 and beyond - Federal workers put on notice; grants and contracts curtailed: So far at least one federal agency -- the National Labor Relations Board -- has already issued a formal 30-day furlough notice to employees. The Department of Justice says it plans to do so by Friday.  And the bulk of federal agencies planning furloughs will follow suit sometime thereafter.  Agencies will also cut back on issuing new contracts and reduce federal grants to everything from schools to airports to states.  Related: Biggest problems with the budget cuts  March 26 and on - Furloughs take effect: Federal workers subject to furloughs will start working fewer days. That may be when the public first notices delays in federal services -- from making decisions about disability benefits to processing visas to providing airport security -- as well cutbacks in the hours of national parks.  When furloughed, employees are prohibited from working for a set number of days for which they will not be paid. The furloughs will vary from agency to agency.  The Pentagon, for instance, has said workers would be furloughed for one day a week up to 22 weeks starting in April. But the Department of Housing and Urban Development is planning on furloughs of just seven days: May 10, May 24, June 14, July 5, July 22, Aug. 16 and Aug. 30, according to a document obtained by CNNMoney. HUD offices nationwide would be closed on those seven days. And the IRS won't start furloughs until summer.  March 27 - Funding for the government expires: Congress must pass a new bill setting funding levels for the rest of fiscal year 2013, which ends Sept. 30. If they don't, the government would shut down all but essential services. This is one legislative vehicle that could contain a sequester fix.  April 1 - Medicare docs take a hit: Medicare payments to health care providers, health care plans and drug plans will be reduced by 2%.  April and May - Budget negotiations: If lawmakers haven't agreed to a sequester fix by this point, they may try to do so during their annual budget negotiations for the next fiscal year.  Mid-May to August - Debt ceiling negotiations: Congress will need to raise the country's debt limit. This could provide another legislative vehicle for a sequester fix, if one hasn't been put in place already.  August and September - Back to school, but not for some: Teachers and school staff affected by education-related cuts may be laid off for the 2013-14 school year.  Still unknown - Smaller unemployment checks: Everyone collecting federal extended unemployment benefits will see their checks cut by 9.4% retroactive to March 1. Just when they would start seeing smaller checks depends on how quickly their state unemployment office makes the change, which will vary from state to state. But chances are good many collecting benefits would see smaller checks sometime in March.  By Dec. 31 - Fewer jobs created: The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the economy would produce 750,000 fewer full-time jobs as a result of the forced spending cuts if they remain in effect for the whole calendar year.  -- CNNMoney's Tami Luhby contributed to this report.

        CNN Sans™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.Bill Maher’s New Rules on the plea to raise the minimum wage is on point. It is hard to understand anyone’s objection to it. A country cannot frown on citizen’s using public assistance if it does not create an economy that pays a living wage to all its citizens that are working.The following snippet with the most relevant bullets from his New Rules segment on the minimum wage is on point.When it comes to raising the minimum wage Conservatives always say it is a non-starter because it cuts into profits. … You might think that paying people enough to live is so self-evident that even crazy people could understand it. But you would be wrong. …Michele Bachmann is not only against raising the minimum wage, she is against having one at all. She wants said “… if we took away the minimum wage … we could … virtually wipe out unemployment … because we would be able to offer jobs at whatever level.” …And naturally Ted Cruz agrees. Ted Cruz thinks it’s a good thing that when his Cuban father came to America he was paid fifty cents an hour to work as a dishwasher. …When did the American dream become this pathway to indentured servitude, this economic death spiral where workers get paid next to nothing, so they can only afford to buy next to nothing, so businesses are forced to sell cheaper and cheaper shit?Consider the fact that most fast food workers whose average age by the way is 29 … are on some form of public assistance which is not surprising. When even working people can’t make enough to live they take money from the government.This is the question the Right has to answer. Do you want smaller government with less handouts or do you want do you want a low minimum wage because you cannot have both. If Coronel Sanders isn’t going to pay the lady behind the counter enough to live on, then Uncle Sam has to. And I for one is getting a little tired of helping highly profitable companies pay their workers.



Bill Maher makes a very important statement. The average American citizens are subsidizing McDonald’s. Americans are subsidizing all companies that are paying below subsistence level wages.The viral story of a McDonald’s employee calling a McDonald’s help line is probative. McDonald’s gave her information necessary to get government assistance and charity. This was a full time worker. What she really needs is an increase in the minimum wage. What she needs is the dignity of pay she can live on.Bill Maher is late to the party. George Carlin figured out long time ago that the American Dream had become a pathway to indentured servitude. He laid it out in his “The American Dream” standup skit. The minimum wage is part of the problem. However, the problem of the poor and working middle class is much deeper.The problem is income and wealth disparity that is getting worse. Income and growth is extracted from the poor and the middle class with policies to ensure the incessant steady growth of the wealth and income of a very few.

    State of the Union, Part 2: President pledges to make 'America a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing'President Barack Obama took us inside his mind, again, Tuesday night and gave us a glimpse of what motivates him, how he sees the country and how much of the country sees itself. The president is psychologically predictable. He does not surprise. Having been abandoned as a boy by his father, and then his mother, only to then learn that his grandmother feared people of his race, he seems inherently to distrust individual initiative and intention and to place his trust only in the collective—i.e. the state. What benefits a burgeoning central authority is good for all.  When a child’s guardians keep letting him down in profound ways, that child can grow up to want a lot of power himself and distrust the idea of giving anyone else very much.Hence, the president wants to use tax increases to remove wealth from those who earned it, fair and square.  Because, you see, wealth really does confer power on those who amass it, and giving that kind of authority to individuals, rather than the collective, is anathema to the President.  It likely reawakens in him very closely held memories of what he got from his parents when most in need: Not much. Individuals are also better off without guns, the president would have us believe. It is true, of course, that some capital crimes are committed with guns (but only the minority with automatic weapons, and lots with knives and explosives and by strangulation, too).[pullquote]But guns also happen to empower tens of millions of American individuals, too. They promote in individuals the idea that they can take care of themselves and make their own decisions and take care of their families, including their children. And that’s what I believe is the president’s real problem with them.  Because, as a boy, the independent decisions of the adults around him were, frankly, horribly traumatizing.The president celebrates his Affordable Care Act. But the reality of ObamaCare is that, for the first time, ever, it earmarks American citizens’ after-tax income to be spent, by law, on a product that they might or might not want:  health insurance. They have to buy it. The collective always knows best in Obama’s mind.  Because individuals left him out in the cold, when he needed consistency and nurturance the most.Many millions of young Americans listened to Barack Obama on Tuesday night, as they have listened to his core message for nearly five long years. And his message has remained remarkably consistent and remarkably toxic to their psychological well-being:  Do not rely on yourself.  Entitlement Nation will parent you, until you forget about growing up, period. Stay on your parents’ health insurance, even if you are 18 and in great health and would rather—wisely or not—use that money to start an Internet company in your basement.  It’s okay to blame rich people if you can’t earn money.  Just ignore the fact that government policy is now hostile to entrepreneurs who might otherwise decide it is worth the risk to staff up. The government will even grade colleges and tell you which ones are worth attending.  Really?  Teenagers can’t even research that for themselves, anymore?  Their parents can’t help them evaluate schools?  The state, the collective—long known for the miserable educational system it has deployed—will  decide which institutions of higher learning are worthy? Welcome to the psychological projection of an abandoned boy’s vision of how much you can rely on other individuals and on yourself. The less, the better.  When your mother and father take off on you as a kid, when your white grandmother seems to fear people of color, you probably figure putting any trust in individuals is crazy.My 10-year-old son was watching last night.  I was just glad that he got to see part of the Bruins’ game, too.  Because he saw remarkable athletes find something inside themselves that they tapped to come back from being down three goals, to tie the game 3-3 (even though they eventually lost in a shootout).  And when Brad Marchand scored that tying goal, with 42 seconds left, and no goalie in the Bruins’ net, I saw my son jump up, out of his chair and pump his fist in the air and yell, “Yes!  He did it!  He did it!” “Yup,” I said, “He’s amazing.”People—individual people—make things happen.  Yes, they are part of a team.  But celebrating their individual accomplishments and rewarding them for them isn’t bad.  It’s good.  Brad Marchand scored that goal.  He did it.  And people build their own businesses, too, Mr. President.  Things did not go well for you at the hands of the individuals who were empowered to care for you.  But individuals are not inherently bad.Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.SubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!

      Governor Jan Brewer (R/Teahadi-AZ) is getting a lot of really good press right now for having pushed Medicaid expansion through the more-or-less Tea Party controlled Arizona legislature. Admittedly, this is, in and of itself, an unabashedly good thing. Hundreds of thousands of Arizonans, the poorest and most at-risk among us, will no longer be without care. The safety net Arizona voted to give ourselves, AHCCCS, has been restored in a way that will improve our economy and shore up our state's still shaky finances. Regardless the motive, the outcome is a great thing.That said, you can take this media redemption of Jan Brewer and stuff it. Chris Hayes, I'm looking at you.Let's be clear, Jan Brewer is not an idiot. She may have been the rising star and darling of the far right of the Arizona Republican Party, but she's not a Black Helicopter Republican. Consider the gold coin bill. This pile of arble-garble had two reasons behind it. There was the reason that the national press got - the need to give opportunities to gold savers to spend their gold (which defeats the purposes of gold saving). Then there was the actual reason that circulated on the ground. OBAMA was going to spend so much money that the dollar was just going to continue inflating so much it would be useless, and Arizona needed to be prepared! Prepared, I say!!Nevermind that the facts dictate that neither inflation nor federal spending have exactly been rocketing into the sun, they know.The Black Helicopter Caucus has given us the Agenda 21 ban, forced oaths of loyalty, a pee bill (not joking, and neither were they), and defended your right to hate. Granted, this has provided Arizona with some excellent political entertainment. But walk through the Governor's signatures of these bills. The Agenda 21 ban? Signed. Pee bill? Killed in the House (due to global outrage turning it completely toxic, thanks everybody). The gold coin bill? Vetoed for technical reasons. But what Jan Brewer cares about is Jan Brewer. That lovely religious anarchy bill? She wrote in a letter that she regretted vetoing it, but she shot that hostage (and four more) dead to get AHCCCS expansion.Now, to someone who has lived here for years, I feel the need to inform all of you who have not of a simple truth. Arizona is not normal. I do not mean "weird" the way most out of state folk mean it. I do not mean crazy. I mean there's the way the rest of the South runs, then there's how the South runs, and then there's Arizona. Arizonans like the political theater. We're the state that produced both Sinema and McCain, both Brewer and Grijalva. We expect them to be colorful, energetic, full of ideas and brilliant speeches, and if they are anything less, we tend to just stay home and let the other guy win.Now, in terms of colorful, Jan Brewer is a damn rainbow. The electoral issue for her is to whom her colors appeal. Arizona's demographics are shifting at a breathtaking pace. The state is rapidly turning younger and browner, the electorate is moving steadily leftward on high-visibility issues. Now, were Jan Brewer running for governor again, she'd've taken the Medicaid money and not moved on immigratiion. But Brewer can't run for Governor, she's term limited. She can, however, run for McCain's seat in 2016.Consider McCain's behavior. He's back to work on his legacy issue - immigration. On immigration, he reality checked his own party. On drones he all but body checked Rand Paul. He's monkeying in Syria, rumored to be scuttling Russian-American talks on the subject. McCain is spending political capital like a sailor spends cash, which only makes sense for one reason: he's getting done. McCain will be 80 when his term ends. Generic old at this age usually raises the r-word, but lest we forget, the man valiantly served his country under what can only be described as the most harrowing of circumstances, and carries the physical scars that go with it. I may not always agree with his politics, but he's generally proved himself to be an upright man whose convictions are real. He's earned the right to shore up his reputation, settle some old scores, and live out his days in well-earned peace on his Cornville ranch. That said, in my opinion, all signs point to Brewer burnishing her legacy in the hopes that in 2016 she'll be remembered more for Medicaid expansion than for SB1070, for denying DREAMers their licenses, for selling the Capitol, and on and on the list goes. The reason is simple - she is gambling that by the 2016 Senate race, if she can run as the Governor that worked across the aisle, she can force the Democrat to run negative against her, and Democrats do not win when we run negative.There's only one catch. This strategy relies on collective amnesia. We would do well to let that stop being a feature of the American electorate. She's no less extreme and calculating a politician after Medicaid than before it, and the media, especially the liberal media, should remember all of her tenure, from 2009 to 2014, not from January til now. So America, do Arizona a favor - stop white-washing Jan Brewer. She doesn't deserve it.Perhaps we can help you find what you wanted when you hit this error page?Try our site map for a list of all online sections or check out our columnists page.We also have search tools for finding a particular stories and topics pages covering many major issues and people.If you are looking for a particular suburban publication or story, the best place to start is our suburbs page.

But it's not clear what the actual turnout will be, how many of the participants are workers and what impact they'll have on restaurant operations.The actions would mark the largest showing yet in a push that began a year ago. At a time when there's growing national and international attention on economic disparities, labor unions, worker advocacy groups and Democrats are hoping to build public support to raise the federal minimum wage of $7.25, or about $15,000 a year for full-time work.Protesters are calling for pay of $15 an hour, but the figure is seen more as a rallying point than a near-term possibility.In New York City, about 100 protesters blew whistles and beat drums while marching into a McDonald's at around 6:30 a.m.; one startled customer grabbed his food and fled as they flooded the restaurant, while another didn't look up from eating and reading amid their chants of "We can't survive on $7.25!"Community leaders took turns giving speeches for about 15 minutes until the police arrived and ordered protesters out of the store. The crowd continued to demonstrate outside for about 45 minutes. A McDonald's manager declined to be interviewed and asked that the handful of customers in the store not be bothered.In Detroit, about 50 demonstrators turned out for a pre-dawn rally in front of a McDonald's. A handful of employees walked off the job, but the restaurant stayed open as a manager and other employees worked the front counter and drive-thru window.Julius Waters, a 29-year-old McDonald's maintenance worker who was among the protesters, said it's hard making ends meet on his wage of $7.40 an hour."I need a better wage for myself, because, right now, I'm relying on aid, and $7.40 is not able to help me maintain taking care of my son. I'm a single parent," Waters said.In Atlanta, about 40 demonstrators rallied at a Burger King; another demonstration was planned later in the day.The push for higher pay in the fast-food industry faces an uphill battle. The industry competes aggressively on value offerings and companies have warned that they would need to raise prices if wages were hiked. Most fast-food locations are also owned and operated by franchisees, which lets companies such as McDonald's Corp., Burger King Worldwide Inc. and Yum Brands Inc. say that they don't control worker pay.However, labor advocates have pointed out that companies control many other aspects of restaurant operations through their franchise agreements, including menus, suppliers and equipment.Fast-food workers have historically been seen as difficult to unionize, given the industry's high turnover rates. But the Service Employees International Union, which represents more than 2 million workers in health care, janitorial and other industries, has been providing considerable organizational and financial support to the push for higher pay over the past year.Berlin Rosen, a political consulting and public relations firm based in New York City, also has been coordinating communications efforts and connecting organizers with media outlets.The National Restaurant Association, an industry lobbying group, said most those protesting were union workers and that "relatively few" workers have participated in past actions. It called the demonstrations a "campaign engineered by national labor groups."McDonald's said in a statement that it's "committed to providing our employees with opportunities to succeed." The company, based in Oak Brook, Ill., said it offers employees advancement opportunities, competitive pay and benefits.In the meantime, the protests are getting some high-powered support from the White House. In an economic policy speech Wednesday, President Barack Obama specifically mentioned fast-food and retail workers "who work their tails off and are still living at or barely above poverty" in his call for raising the federal minimum wage.Labor Secretary Thomas Perez also offered words of support for the protesters on the agency's blog."We see momentum gathering and a consensus emerging around the idea that we need to increase the federal minimum wage, to give these workers and millions like them a fair day's pay for a fair day's work," Perez said in the statement.Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has promised a vote on the wage hike by the end of the year. But the measure is not expected to gain traction in the House, where Republican leaders oppose it.Supporters of wage hikes have been more successful at the state and local level. California, Connecticut and Rhode Island raised their minimum wages this year. Last month, voters in New Jersey approved an increase in the minimum to $8.25 an hour, up from $7.25 an hour.___AP Labor Writer Sam Hananel contributed from Washington, AP Writer Mike Householder contributed from Detroit and AP videographer Johnny Clark contributed from Atlanta.____Follow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoiA New Zealand television commentator who adopted a mock Asian accent during a post-game rugby interview on Friday is likely to keep his job despite an outpouring of public criticism.

Marwa Elselehdar was working as a first mate in command of the Aida IV in Alexandria when the 220,000 ton Ever Given got stuck, blocking one of the world’s busiest shipping routes for six days. The 29-year-old is a celebrated feminist figure in Egypt. In 2015 she became both the youngest and the first female Egyptian captain to cross the newly-expanded Suez Canal. Two years later she was honoured by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi during women’s day celebrations. Her Instagram - a collection of motivational messages and her life on board - boasts over 30,000 followers. But when the Ever Given became an online sensation, a rumour mill was telling the world that she was to blame. "I felt that I might be targeted maybe because I'm a successful female in this field or because I'm Egyptian, but I'm not sure," she told the BBC.Online rumors and fake news headlines said Marwa Elselehdar was the captain of the Ever Given container ship blocking the Suez Canal.Alaska has largely restored the pre-pandemic amenities to which flyers were accustomed.

The Oxford/AstraZeneca jab has yet to obtain approval from the US Food and Drug Administration, but production of the vaccine has started in anticipation of a green light. It was being produced by a sub-contractor at a plant operated by Emergent BioSolutions in Baltimore. The plant was also manufacturing Johnson & Johnson's vaccines and workers at the factory mistakenly mixed the ingredients. As a result 15 million doses of the vaccine produced by Johnson & Johnson, which has been given FDA approval, had to be destroyed. Johnson & Johnson will now assume full responsibility for the production of its vaccine at the plant. The pharmaceutical giant, which has promised to deliver 100 million doses of its single-shot vaccine to the US by the end of May, said it will deploy additional staff at the Baltimore plant.With no competing bloodlines or public rivalries, Jordan’s royal family have traditionally avoided the high-profile arrests, purges and coups seen in other monarchies in the Middle East. It is part of the regime's carefully-cultivated reputation as a Western-allied bastion of stability in a region often marked by chaos. But the house arrest of Prince Hamzah, and the detention of another junior member of the royal family and multiple other high-profile figures has dramatically pushed previously private rifts into the public eye. “Praying that truth and justice will prevail for all the innocent victims of this wicked slander. God bless and keep them safe,” tweeted Hamzah’s American born mother, Queen Noor, on Sunday morning. While the Jordanian government denied that Hamzah had been arrested, a video shared with the BBC by his lawyer showed the prince saying he is “not allowed to go out, to communicate with people or to meet with them, because in the meetings that I had been present in — or on social media relating to visits that I had made — there had been criticism of the government or the king.”A viral TikTok video shows a dispute with a passenger on a Southwest Airlines flight who refused to comply with COVID-19 safety protocols.Residents ordered to evacuate over fears for the pond in the Tampa Bay area, which stores 500 million gallons of water containing radium and uranium.The memorial included illustrations of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, as well as locks with the names of other people killed by police.Parents are angry after a freshman class at Cedar Hill High School in Dallas had to watch the full video of George Floyd's death for the assignment.Each mummy was carried in a glass capsule with shock-absorbers so that the ancient royals didn't get damaged during the journey to a new museum.No COVID vaccine has been authorized for use for children under 16.PALMETTO — Gov.

      Editor’s Note: Donna Brazile, a CNN contributor and a Democratic strategist, is vice chairwoman for voter registration and participation at the Democratic National Committee. She is a nationally syndicated columnist, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and author of “Cooking with Grease: Stirring the Pot in America.” She was manager for the Gore-Lieberman presidential campaign in 2000.
    
  Despite the many differences I had with former President George W. Bush on a range of public policy issues, or as he called them, “decision points,” I found common ground with him in one area, simply because we decided to put aside partisanship and do something good.

  Hurricane Katrina’s devastation and the bungled rescue efforts are seared in the national memory.  Bush’s “heckuva job” remark turned into a byword for government incompetence and public distrust. The shallowness of it coming at such a terrible and low point  left deep wounds that are still healing.  That was what it was. 

  But rather than rehash all that went wrong, I want to share what I believe to have been President Bush’s determination to follow up on commitments, and the intense, personal, dedicated efforts he made to revive and restore people’s futures.  I know what I’m talking about.

  Bush 43: ‘History will ultimately judge’

  Kathleen Blanco, Louisiana’s governor in 2005, asked me to serve on the state’s commission overseeing the long-term recovery from the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina.  I’ve kept a close watch over the last eight years.

  Hurricane Katrina wasn’t one natural disaster: It was a triple whammy of water, winds and lawlessness. An Army Corps engineer on CBS talked this week about Midwest flooding: “Water is the perfect instrument of destruction,” he said.  He is so right: Katrina’s waters laid waste to an area the size of Great Britain. Its winds reached 174 mph and, together, they took 1,833 lives.

  Every member of my family was displaced by Katrina. Last year, I lost both my father and sister.  But I had them with me that much longer because they were rescued from the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. My father, Lionel, left New Orleans only two times in his life. The first was to serve his country in Korea. The second was when FEMA evacuated him to San Antonio, Texas.

  How will history remember George W. Bush?

  My older sister, Sheila – people sometimes thought we were twins, we looked so much alike – was in an assisted care home. Sheila developed a brain tumor in childhood. Brain surgery left her needing help, although she still managed to finish high school and college.  When FEMA officials told me it might be weeks before we found Sheila, I was furious.

  CNN’s Wolf Blitzer made a public plea for nearby citizens to see if the residents had survived.  Eddie Rodriguez of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, and our cousin, Keith, a cop, rescued her from the building’s rooftop. Most other residents had left before her. Sheila wouldn’t leave until she saw someone she knew.  Like so many others, she was relocated to Baton Rouge.

    Bitterness can corrode the soul. A grudge is like the chains on Marley’s ghost.
  
    Donna Brazile
  
  My 92-year-old great uncle Henry, a WWII vet, was plucked from another rooftop and transported to Roswell, Georgia, only to suffer a heart attack.  All seven of my remaining siblings, my father, uncle, aunts, and other relatives, lost everything in Katrina.  I was upset – mad as hell – and disappointed  But, I made a decision not to act out – act against Bush – but rather to turn to his administration for help, and to offer my help.

  “Mr. President,” I said, “how can I help you?”

  “Civility,” he said.

  Opinion: Jury is still out on Bush

  Bitterness can corrode the soul.  A grudge is like the chains on Marley’s ghost.  We can carry these chains in life and they weigh us down.  President Obama and former President Bush have been working for eight years to change the atmosphere in Washington, to get Congress to move beyond pride and party.

  So far, not even disasters or tragedies that have united the American people – Hurricane Sandy, Sandy Hook, and Boston –  have moved the politicians. Not enough, anyway.

    Bush understood the need for civility. I joined him despite my frustration because the need was too great for finger-pointing and blame-making. 

  
    Donna Brazile
  
  Bush understood the need for civility. I joined him despite my frustration because the need was too great for finger-pointing and blame-making.  He flew to New Orleans and addressed the nation:  “Tonight I also offer this pledge to the American people: Throughout the area hit by the hurricane, we will do what it takes. We will stay as long as it takes to help citizens rebuild their communities and their lives.”

  Glimpse at a White House before everything changed

  George W. Bush was good as his word. He visited the Gulf states 17 times; went 13 times to New Orleans. Laura Bush made 24 trips. Bush saw that $126 billion in aid was sent to the Gulf’s residents, as some members of his own party in Congress balked.

  Bush put a special emphasis on rebuilding schools and universities. He didn’t forget African-Americans: Bush provided $400 million to the historically black colleges, now integrated, that remain a pride, and magnet for African-American students.  Laura Bush, a librarian, saw to it that thousands of books ruined by the floods were replaced. To this day, there are many local libraries with tributes devoted to her efforts.

  It was a team effort.  I’m glad to report the commission I served on went out-of-business in 2010.  I’m also grateful and proud to report that President Bush was one of the leaders, and a very important member, of that team. Our recovery can be credited to the civility and tireless efforts of President Bush and other Americans, who united and worked together to help rebuild the Gulf and the place of my birth, New Orleans.

  Leaked classified documents show the U.S. National Security Agency and its British counterpart are among the “worst offenders” of mass surveillance without oversight, according to an open letter purportedly written by Edward Snowden and published Sunday by the German magazine Der Spiegel.

  The publication of the letter, titled “A Manifesto for the Truth,” comes as leaks by the former NSA contract analyst have roiled U.S.-European relations amid allegations that the NSA and the UK’s Government Communications Headquarters monitored the communication data of some world leaders.

  “The world has learned a lot in a short amount of time about irresponsibly operated security agencies and, at times, criminal surveillance programs. Sometimes the agencies try to avoid controls,” Snowden wrote, according to the news magazine. 

  “While the NSA and GCHQ (the British national security agency) appear to be the worst offenders – at least according to the documents that are currently public – we cannot forget that mass surveillance is a global problem and needs a global solution.” 

  The letter, published in German by Der Spiegel, was written on Friday in Moscow and provided to Der Spiegel through a “locked channel,” the news magazine said. It was published in German and has been translated by CNN. 

  Snowden, 30, has admitted in interviews he was the source behind the leak of classified NSA documents, which revealed the existence of top-secret surveillance programs that collect records of domestic e-mails and telephone calls in the United States and monitor the cell phone and Internet activity of overseas residents. He is wanted in the United States on espionage charges. 

  A recent report by Der Spiegel, citing documents provided by Snowden, alleged the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cell phone. Some reports also suggest the United States carried out surveillance on French and Spanish citizens.

  The allegations have prompted some European countries to call for investigations. It also has prompted congressional hearings in the United States, where some are calling for more transparency and more oversight of American spy programs. 

  Opinion: Don’t underestimate risks of government spying

  ’Witch hunt’

  The letter also accused governments of trying to squash debate about mass surveillance “with a never before seen witch hunt” that threatens journalists and criminalizes the publication of details about the programs. 

  In the letter, Snowden purportedly writes that his actions were bringing about change. 

  “The debate they wanted to avoid is now taking place in countries around the world,” the letter said. 

  “And instead of causing damage, the use of this new public knowledge is causing society to push for political reforms, oversight and new laws.”

  Snowden has been in Moscow since June after fleeing from Hong Kong. In August, Russia granted him asylum for one year.

  Snowden gets website job in Russia

  The release of the open letter is the second in a matter of days from Snowden, who released a letter to German authorities through an intermediary. 

  Last week, Hans-Christian Stroebele, a member of Germany’s parliament, met with Snowden in Russia. Stroebele returned from the meeting with a letter from Snowden to German authorities, which was distributed to the media.

  In it, Snowden said he is confident that with international support, the United States would abandon its efforts to “treat dissent as defection” and “criminalize political speech with felony charges.”

   “I hope that when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved, I will be able to cooperate in the responsible finding of fact regarding reports in the media, particularly in regard to the truth and authenticity of documents, as appropriate and in accordance with the law,” he wrote. 

  Report: Snowden’s Russia asylum not breached by NSA spying reports

  ’Face justice’

  The White House did not immediately respond to Snowden’s claims in the letter. 

  But earlier Sunday, White House Senior Adviser Dan Pfeiffer said on ABC’s “This Week” that there has been no discussion of granting Snowden clemency. 

  “Mr. Snowden violated U.S. law,” Pfeiffer said. “And our belief has always been that he should return to the U.S. and face justice.”

  It was a sentiment echoed by the heads of the House and Senate intelligence committees. 

  “He had an opportunity – if what he was, was a whistle-blower – to pick up the phone and call the House Intelligence Committee, the Senate Intelligence Committee, and say, ‘I have some information,’” Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Sunday on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”

  House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, said Snowden has to “own up with what he’s done.”

  “If he wants to come back and open up to the responsibility of the fact that he took and stole information, he violated his oath, he disclosed classified information – that by the way has allowed three different terrorist organizations, affiliates of al Qaeda to change the way they communicate – I’d be happy to have that discussion with him,” Rogers said on “Face the Nation.”

The payouts went to about 4,500 farmers between 2008 and 2012.According to estimates in the report, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) made $10.6 million in payments to 1,103 deceased individuals for a year or more after their deaths. The Risk Management Agency (RMA) made $22 million in subsidies and allowances to 3,434 program policyholders for two or more years after death.This is a drop in the bucket given the $20 billion the USDA spends yearly to help more than 1 million participants, says Bob Young, chief economist with the American Farm Bureau Federation.“In the overall grand scheme of things, it was not a whole heck of a lot of money,” Young told Yahoo News. “Any dollar that is not spent properly is an issue, admittedly. But, wow, in terms of overall percentages of money that were put out of whatever, I thought it was kind of amazing that it was as small as it was.”The USDA’s written response to the audit stated it “generally agrees with the report’s findings and recommendations” but defended the agencies by pointing out that the programs had close working relationships with participants and imposed yearly reporting.“Although NRCS and RMA can identify some deceased participants during their normal operations, we do not believe that identifying deceased individuals during normal operations is a reliable substitute for having a systematic process,” federal auditors wrote.Young says he doubts very few farming families tried to deliberately fraud the government.“Sometimes you’ll end up with some time between when a person passes away and the time the estate gets restructured or whatever, and you’ll get a payment that gets caught in the middle,” Young says.The RMA, the report notes, put a computer system in place and started checking claims against the government’s list of deceased persons in May.The GAO’s fraud findings come at time when Washington is squabbling over the cost of the current farm bill, which expires in two months.In its report to Congress, federal auditors said their findings “may call into question whether these safety net programs are benefiting the agriculture sector as intended.”A New Zealand television commentator who adopted a mock Asian accent during a post-game rugby interview on Friday is likely to keep his job despite an outpouring of public criticism.  Joe Wheeler, a former New Zealand Maori representative who commentates for the cable network Sky Sport, used the accent after the Super Rugby Aotearoa match between the Highlanders and Crusaders.  Speaking with Highlanders flyhalf Mitchell Hunt, Wheeler referenced the performance of Japan international flanker Kazuki Himeno who started a match for the Highlanders for the first time.Survivors and their family members recount what happened when Islamist militants targeted Palma.Egypt’s first female ship captain says she was subject to a fake news campaign blaming her for grounding the Ever Given container ship in the Suez Canal, despite at the time working on a ship that was hundreds of miles away. Marwa Elselehdar was working as a first mate in command of the Aida IV in Alexandria when the 220,000 ton Ever Given got stuck, blocking one of the world’s busiest shipping routes for six days. The 29-year-old is a celebrated feminist figure in Egypt. In 2015 she became both the youngest and the first female Egyptian captain to cross the newly-expanded Suez Canal. Two years later she was honoured by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi during women’s day celebrations. Her Instagram - a collection of motivational messages and her life on board - boasts over 30,000 followers. But when the Ever Given became an online sensation, a rumour mill was telling the world that she was to blame. "I felt that I might be targeted maybe because I'm a successful female in this field or because I'm Egyptian, but I'm not sure," she told the BBC.Online rumors and fake news headlines said Marwa Elselehdar was the captain of the Ever Given container ship blocking the Suez Canal.Alaska has largely restored the pre-pandemic amenities to which flyers were accustomed.

The Oxford/AstraZeneca jab has yet to obtain approval from the US Food and Drug Administration, but production of the vaccine has started in anticipation of a green light. It was being produced by a sub-contractor at a plant operated by Emergent BioSolutions in Baltimore. The plant was also manufacturing Johnson & Johnson's vaccines and workers at the factory mistakenly mixed the ingredients. As a result 15 million doses of the vaccine produced by Johnson & Johnson, which has been given FDA approval, had to be destroyed. Johnson & Johnson will now assume full responsibility for the production of its vaccine at the plant. The pharmaceutical giant, which has promised to deliver 100 million doses of its single-shot vaccine to the US by the end of May, said it will deploy additional staff at the Baltimore plant.With no competing bloodlines or public rivalries, Jordan’s royal family have traditionally avoided the high-profile arrests, purges and coups seen in other monarchies in the Middle East. It is part of the regime's carefully-cultivated reputation as a Western-allied bastion of stability in a region often marked by chaos. But the house arrest of Prince Hamzah, and the detention of another junior member of the royal family and multiple other high-profile figures has dramatically pushed previously private rifts into the public eye. “Praying that truth and justice will prevail for all the innocent victims of this wicked slander. God bless and keep them safe,” tweeted Hamzah’s American born mother, Queen Noor, on Sunday morning. While the Jordanian government denied that Hamzah had been arrested, a video shared with the BBC by his lawyer showed the prince saying he is “not allowed to go out, to communicate with people or to meet with them, because in the meetings that I had been present in — or on social media relating to visits that I had made — there had been criticism of the government or the king.”A viral TikTok video shows a dispute with a passenger on a Southwest Airlines flight who refused to comply with COVID-19 safety protocols.Residents ordered to evacuate over fears for the pond in the Tampa Bay area, which stores 500 million gallons of water containing radium and uranium.The memorial included illustrations of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, as well as locks with the names of other people killed by police.Parents are angry after a freshman class at Cedar Hill High School in Dallas had to watch the full video of George Floyd's death for the assignment.Each mummy was carried in a glass capsule with shock-absorbers so that the ancient royals didn't get damaged during the journey to a new museum.No COVID vaccine has been authorized for use for children under 16.PALMETTO — Gov.

The chart shows up until 1980 a fairly stable trend - labor's share would fall during a recession and then grow until the next recession.  After 1980 the trend changes - the recovery in mid-80's never restored labor's share of income to what it was in 1980.  Even the boom of the '90's did not restore labor's share to what it was before '80.  Things really start to breakdown after 2000 - where there is a continuing and unprecedented decline in labor's share of income.  Why does this matter? At its core I think most everyone to the left of center would agree that the fundamental problem with the economy is a problem of demand.  In introductory economics they usually talk about the Marginal Propensity to Consume ("MPC").  One of the first things you learn is that poor people have a higher propensity to consume than the rich.  There are only so many houses and cars the rich can buy until they start stashing money in places like Switzerland.  As the rich increase their share of the economy, you begin to have a systemic problem in the economy.  The rich get more and more share of the wealth, but they don't spend it so the demand problem gets worse and worse.In my opinion this is the current problem.  Labor's share is declining because companies are offshoring production, or alternatively, automating it.  In either instance, labor gets less and less share of the total income.I promised one graph - but lets look at one more.  Let's compare labor's share of income to the S&P 500 since 2000.Two things to note - the stock market is going up while labor's share is going down.  I don't think is a a real surprise, but the graph shows the cause pretty well.  But there is a second point I want to make as well.  In addition to a lack of demand, a world where the rich have too much money is a world that is going to be subject to asset bubbles.  If the rich don't spend their money it is going to go somewhere.  That somewhere is in part various financial markets.  But because financial markets are prone to panic, I think you can predict that we will see more bubbles build and then burst.The graph suggests at least in part that my second point is true is well.There are many conclusions you can draw on this.  Some here will say that this is a house of cards that will all come crashing down.  I don't think this is really right for a variety of reasons.  But I DO think that until something happens to change the balance of power between labor and capital, the economy will not perform as it could, and the fruits of that economy will be very unequally distributed.I close with Marriner Eccles' (the head of the Fed under FDR) famous explanation of the cause of the Great Depression.  His words ring true today:Instead of achieving that kind of distribution, a giant suction pump had by 1929-30 drawn into a few hands an increasing portion of currently produced wealth. This served them as capital accumulations. But by taking purchasing power out of the hands of mass consumers, the savers denied to themselves the kind of effective demand for their products that would justify a reinvestment of their capital accumulations in new plants. In consequence, as in a poker game where the chips were concentrated in fewer and fewer hands, the other fellows could stay in the game only by borrowing. When their credit ran out, the game stopped.Thu Jun 06, 2013 at  7:01 AM PT: Since this is on the reclist, I thought I would point people to a very wonkish - but still important piece by Brad Delong this morning.  Delong is pretty much required reading if you want to understand the economy - he was one of the leaders of the attacks on Reinhart and Rogoff.He notes in part about the incredible gap between corporate profits and the Treasury rate:"Right now the profit share in the US economy is at levels far and away higher than I at least ever imagined I would see. And, given the high profit share and the extremely low return on Treasury notes the stock market is far and away lower than I at least ever imagined I would see. With downward pressure on real wages from elevated unemployment making it more likely that profits will grow faster than the economy rather than shrink, the 9% point gap between the S&P earnings yield of 7% and the Treasury note real yield of -2%--I never thought I would see anything like this in my lifetime."WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court usually isn't friendly toward questionable patents, but it came down overwhelmingly on the side of agribusiness giant Monsanto Monday in a case that's bound to resonate throughout the biotechnology industry.The court ruled unanimously that an Indiana farmer violated Monsanto's patent on genetically modified soybeans when he culled some from a grain elevator and used them to replant his own crop in future years."If simple copying were a protected use, a patent would plummet in value after the first sale of the first item containing the invention," Justice Elena Kagan ruled in a short 10-page opinion. "The undiluted patent monopoly, it might be said, would extend not for 20 years as the Patent Act promises, but for only one transaction. And that would result in less incentive for innovation than Congress wanted."Who it helps: Inventors and entrepreneurs who have patents on products that can be self-replicated, from computer software to cell lines. While Kagan's decision is limited to the Monsanto case, it bolsters the argument that self-replicating products can be protected from patent infringement even if their challengers go through third parties.Who it hurts: Consumers paying high prices. The Center for Food Safety released a report in February that showed three corporations control much of the global commercial seed market. It found that from 1995-2011, the average cost to plant 1 acre of soybeans rose 325%.What's to come: Still pending is a decision on whether human genes can be patented. That case tests a company's patent on the genes that can identify an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. During oral arguments in April, the justices seemed far more skeptical of the merits of that patent.Monsanto's soybeans represent the cream of the crop because they are resistant to the weed killer Roundup. Farmers must pay Monsanto's price to plant the beans themselves.That's not what Indiana farmer Vernon Hugh Bowman did. After one year of going through Monsanto, he bought his second crop from a grain elevator. Then he used his own soybeans that resisted Roundup in future years -- in essence, the court said, making copies of a patented invention.Bowman's attorney, Mark Walters, had argued that the Monsanto seeds were acquired innocently enough from the grain elevator, and that Bowman's little operation never would threaten the company's monopoly.Two lower federal courts weren't impressed with Bowman's case, ruling in favor of Monsanto. And that argument carried little weight with the justices when the case was argued in February. They noted that Monsanto had spent hundreds of millions of dollars over more than a decade to perfect its soybeans -- something it would not have done if others could so easily replicate them.Bowman contended the soybeans were "self-replicating," but Kagan said that "blame-the-bean defense" wasn't worthy."Bowman was not a passive observer of his soybeans' multiplication," she said. "Or, put another way, the seeds he purchased, miraculous though they might be in other respects, did not spontaneously create eight successive soybean crops."It was Bowman, and not the bean, who controlled the reproduction (unto the eighth generation) of Monsanto's patented invention," Kagan said.Monsanto officials applauded the decision, not just for the company but for innovators of all shapes and sizes."The court's ruling today ensures that longstanding principles of patent law apply to breakthrough 21st century technologies that are central to meeting the growing demands of our planet and its people," said David F. Snively, the company's executive vice president. "The ruling also provides assurance to all inventors throughout the public and private sectors that they can and should continue to invest in innovation that feeds people, improves lives, creates jobs, and allows America to keep its competitive edge."Jim Greenwood, president of the Biotechnology Industry Organization, said the ruling will benefit all forms of biotechnology, "as well as the patients, farmers and consumers who benefit from biotechnology's help in healing, feeding and fueling the world."But Center for Food Safety executive director Andrew Kimbrell called the ruling a setback for farmers. "The court chose to protect Monsanto over farmers," he said. "The court's ruling is contrary to logic and to agronomics, because it improperly attributes seeds' reproduction to farmers, rather than nature."Fordham University School of Law professor Mark Patterson noted the decision stops short of determining how self-reproducing inventions should be handled in all cases."Justice Kagan, in the last paragraph of the opinion, noted that 'such inventions are becoming ever more prevalent, complex, and diverse,'" Patterson said. "Either the court or Congress will have to address them again soon."Follow @richardjwolf on Twitter.Bill Maher’s New Rules on the plea to raise the minimum wage is on point. It is hard to understand anyone’s objection to it. A country cannot frown on citizen’s using public assistance if it does not create an economy that pays a living wage to all its citizens that are working.The following snippet with the most relevant bullets from his New Rules segment on the minimum wage is on point.When it comes to raising the minimum wage Conservatives always say it is a non-starter because it cuts into profits. … You might think that paying people enough to live is so self-evident that even crazy people could understand it. But you would be wrong. …Michele Bachmann is not only against raising the minimum wage, she is against having one at all. She wants said “… if we took away the minimum wage … we could … virtually wipe out unemployment … because we would be able to offer jobs at whatever level.” …And naturally Ted Cruz agrees. Ted Cruz thinks it’s a good thing that when his Cuban father came to America he was paid fifty cents an hour to work as a dishwasher. …When did the American dream become this pathway to indentured servitude, this economic death spiral where workers get paid next to nothing, so they can only afford to buy next to nothing, so businesses are forced to sell cheaper and cheaper shit?Consider the fact that most fast food workers whose average age by the way is 29 … are on some form of public assistance which is not surprising. When even working people can’t make enough to live they take money from the government.This is the question the Right has to answer. Do you want smaller government with less handouts or do you want do you want a low minimum wage because you cannot have both. If Coronel Sanders isn’t going to pay the lady behind the counter enough to live on, then Uncle Sam has to. And I for one is getting a little tired of helping highly profitable companies pay their workers.



Bill Maher makes a very important statement. The average American citizens are subsidizing McDonald’s. Americans are subsidizing all companies that are paying below subsistence level wages.The viral story of a McDonald’s employee calling a McDonald’s help line is probative. McDonald’s gave her information necessary to get government assistance and charity. This was a full time worker. What she really needs is an increase in the minimum wage. What she needs is the dignity of pay she can live on.Bill Maher is late to the party. George Carlin figured out long time ago that the American Dream had become a pathway to indentured servitude. He laid it out in his “The American Dream” standup skit. The minimum wage is part of the problem. However, the problem of the poor and working middle class is much deeper.The problem is income and wealth disparity that is getting worse. Income and growth is extracted from the poor and the middle class with policies to ensure the incessant steady growth of the wealth and income of a very few.

Follow @EgbertoWilliesAdvertisementSupported byBy Paul KrugmanSomething terrible has happened to the soul of the Republican Party. We’ve gone beyond bad economic doctrine. We’ve even gone beyond selfishness and special interests. At this point we’re talking about a state of mind that takes positive glee in inflicting further suffering on the already miserable.The occasion for these observations is, as you may have guessed, the monstrous farm bill the House passed last week.For decades, farm bills have had two major pieces. One piece offers subsidies to farmers; the other offers nutritional aid to Americans in distress, mainly in the form of food stamps (these days officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP). Long ago, when subsidies helped many poor farmers, you could defend the whole package as a form of support for those in need. Over the years, however, the two pieces diverged. Farm subsidies became a fraud-ridden program that mainly benefits corporations and wealthy individuals. Meanwhile food stamps became a crucial part of the social safety net.So House Republicans voted to maintain farm subsidies — at a higher level than either the Senate or the White House proposed — while completely eliminating food stamps from the bill.To fully appreciate what just went down, listen to the rhetoric conservatives often use to justify eliminating safety-net programs. It goes something like this: “You’re personally free to help the poor. But the government has no right to take people’s money” — frequently, at this point, they add the words “at the point of a gun” — “and force them to give it to the poor.”It is, however, apparently perfectly O.K. to take people’s money at the point of a gun and force them to give it to agribusinesses and the wealthy.Now, some enemies of food stamps don’t quote libertarian philosophy; they quote the Bible instead. Representative Stephen Fincher of Tennessee, for example, cited the New Testament: “The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat.” Sure enough, it turns out that Mr. Fincher has personally received millions in farm subsidies.Given this awesome double standard — I don’t think the word “hypocrisy” does it justice — it seems almost anti-climactic to talk about facts and figures. But I guess we must.So: Food stamp usage has indeed soared in recent years, with the percentage of the population receiving stamps rising from 8.7 in 2007 to 15.2 in the most recent data. There is, however, no mystery here. SNAP is supposed to help families in distress, and lately a lot of families have been in distress.In fact, SNAP usage tends to track broad measures of unemployment, like U6, which includes the underemployed and workers who have temporarily given up active job search. And U6 more than doubled in the crisis, from about 8 percent before the Great Recession to 17 percent in early 2010. It’s true that broad unemployment has since declined slightly, while food stamp numbers have continued to rise — but there’s normally some lag in the relationship, and it’s probably also true that some families have been forced to take food stamps by sharp cuts in unemployment benefits.What about the theory, common on the right, that it’s the other way around — that we have so much unemployment thanks to government programs that, in effect, pay people not to work? (Soup kitchens caused the Great Depression!) The basic answer is, you have to be kidding. Do you really believe that Americans are living lives of leisure on $134 a month, the average SNAP benefit?Still, let’s pretend to take this seriously. If employment is down because government aid is inducing people to stay home, reducing the labor force, then the law of supply and demand should apply: withdrawing all those workers should be causing labor shortages and rising wages, especially among the low-paid workers most likely to receive aid. In reality, of course, wages are stagnant or declining — and that’s especially true for the groups that benefit most from food stamps.So what’s going on here? Is it just racism? No doubt the old racist canards — like Ronald Reagan’s image of the “strapping young buck” using food stamps to buy a T-bone steak — still have some traction. But these days almost half of food stamp recipients are non-Hispanic whites; in Tennessee, home of the Bible-quoting Mr. Fincher, the number is 63 percent. So it’s not all about race. What is it about, then? Somehow, one of our nation’s two great parties has become infected by an almost pathological meanspiritedness, a contempt for what CNBC’s Rick Santelli, in the famous rant that launched the Tea Party, called “losers.” If you’re an American, and you’re down on your luck, these people don’t want to help; they want to give you an extra kick. I don’t fully understand it, but it’s a terrible thing to behold.

Roy Blunt, number three on that list up there of votes against Sandy relief. Let's rewind to May 2011.“I’m asking for 100 percent federal reimbursement to local governments,” Blunt said, “They’ve agreed to 75.   I think they have to come to a better number than that, and the right number, I think, would be 100 percent.”Politicians not the kind of dreamer you respect? Fear not! People go on from food stamps to all kinds of achievement.And of course, given the sheer number of people who've participated in nutrition programs over the years, there are millions of everyday successful adults—teachers, lawyers, writers, chefs, executives—who would say things similar to what politicians, actors, musicians and athletes say about how food stamps helped them get through tough times.Of course, not everyone who needs food stamps at some point in their lives goes on to lavish success. But, as with so many other things about government assistance, that's more about poverty than it is about assistance. This is, after all, a nation where rich kids with low test scores are more likely to graduate from college than poor kids with high test scores and where, in big parts of the country, a kid raised in the bottom fifth of the income scale has less than a 10 percent chance of rising to the top fifth. And Paul Ryan's policies would make those outcomes worse, at the same time he's trying to rid himself of the stench of Mitt Romney by claiming to be some kind of anti-poverty crusader.Anyway, Paul Ryan's own dreams apparently weren't killed by the Social Security survivor benefits he collected after his father died.A bipartisan Senate group has agreed on a sweeping legislative proposal that would represent the most ambitious overhaul of the U.S. immigration system in three decades. The Washington Post will be examining portions of the bill on Post Politics in a series of blog entries.One area of the immigration bill that will be proposed this week by a bipartisan group of eight senators that is already drawing fire from civil libertarians is the legislation's dramatic expansion of the E-Verify system, a computer system designed to ensure employers hire only workers legally present in the United States.Though some details of the proposal are not yet clear — the bill itself has not been made public — a summary of the legislation provided to The Washington Post indicates that the bill would require companies with more than 5,000 employees to adopt the system within two years. Those with 500 employees would get three years and all employers, including those in agriculture, would need to do so within four years.The new system will rely more heavily on "photo-matching." The E-Verify system will contain a vast database of photographs, and workers applying for jobs would need to present identification with photographs that match those in the database to prove they are who they say they are and that they are in the country legally.For non-citizens, that would mean showing a work authorization or green card with a photo. Citizens could show passports or driver's licenses, where states have agreed to provide license information to the E-Verify system. To encourage states to turn over the information, he bill includes $250 million in new funding to reimburse states that choose to take part.Photo-matching is less expensive for employers — and potentially less invasive-feeling for workers — than finger-printing, which had been considered by senators during their extensive negotiations.Still, the process already has its critics, which say it amounts to the creation of a new national ID."If you take a step back and think about what that means, when this reaches fruition and is completed, you'll have an Internet-accessible system that has everyone’s photo and identifying information in it," said Chris Calabrese, legislative counsel with the ACLU. "You can easily imagine E-Verify becoming the national ID system."That the system will now be required for employers, even small businesses that might have trouble shouldering the cost, is also a concern, he said. "That's a fundamental shift," he said from the current system, which is largely voluntary.Jim Harper, director of information studies at the Cato Institute, said photographs are the weakest form of biometric identification.  He predicted that a system that is launched using photos would later be expanded to include other identifiers people might see as more problematic  including iris scans and fingerprints. But he said the "knitting together" of available sources of photographs into a single database is itself a concern."I’m standing down on the horizon, waving my arms saying , 'Hey, hey this is a national ID system!" he said. "It's big government at it's worst."Still, many immigration advocates have shelved their long-time opposition to E-Verify, believing it one piece of a necessary compromise that will also allow a path to citizenship for those now in the country illegally. The system, they believe, is necessary to convince wary conservatives that the nation will not face a new flood of illegal immigrants once a path to citizenship is provided for many who are already here.Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, said a new system to reduce incentives for employers to hire illegal immigrants — and make it harder for them to do so — is a key piece of any broad-based overhaul of the system."It's the essential trade-off: legalization and a path to citizenship, for employer verification," he said. "That is really the heart of every comprehensive immigration reform  package ever put together."The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy PolicyThe most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy PolicyAdvertisementSupported byBy Binyamin AppelbaumWASHINGTON — The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was conceived by a Harvard professor, embraced by the Obama administration and pushed into law by Congressional Democrats determined to expand the federal government’s authority to protect borrowers from abusive lending practices — all in the space of just three years.But even after the agency opened its doors in July 2011, almost exactly two years ago, its legal authority remained uncertain so long as Republicans prevented the confirmation of a director to lead the agency, as required by law.That barricade collapsed on Tuesday. Republicans agreed to allow the confirmation of Richard Cordray, by a vote of 66 to 34, cementing a new era of expansive federal oversight of companies that lend money to consumers.Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who conceived the agency when she was a Harvard professor and supervised its creation as an Obama administration official, presided over the 66-to-34 confirmation vote, announcing the results with obvious satisfaction.“It is a truly historic day,” Ms. Warren told reporters before the vote. “There’s no doubt that the consumer agency will survive beyond the crib. There is now no doubt that the American people will have a strong watchdog in Washington.”Mr. Cordray, 54, and the agency are now set up to regulate interactions between borrowers and lenders, from the largest banks to mom-and-pop payday shops, and the terms of mortgages and student loans among other financial transactions.He was confirmed one day shy of the second anniversary of his nomination by Mr. Obama. In January 2012, Mr. Obama installed Mr. Cordray at the agency when Congress was in recess, a move that the administration described as fulfilling the legal requirement for the agency to exercise the full measure of its powers. But some administration opponents did not agree. Since then, the agency has begun to assert authority over nonbank financial companies, including mortgage and payday lenders, but its actions have been shadowed by uncertainty about the legality of Mr. Cordray’s appointment.The Supreme Court agreed in June to hear a case regarding the legality of Mr. Obama’s recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board. If the court rules against the administration, it would open the way for challenges regarding Mr. Cordray, who was appointed on the same day and in the same way. The vote on Tuesday, however, means any such ruling most likely would have limited consequences. “Today’s action brings added certainty to the industries we oversee and reinforces our responsibility to stand on the side of consumers and see that they are treated fairly in the financial marketplace,” Mr. Cordray said in a statement.Republicans had insisted they would block any nominee to lead the consumer agency, instead demanding that Democrats agree to eliminate the position and replace it with a board of directors. Forty-four Republican senators made that demand in a May 2011 letter, and 43 repeated it earlier this year. Senator Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, said Tuesday that he had agreed to allow a vote after speaking with Mr. Cordray in person on Monday night and again on Tuesday morning. Mr. Portman said that Mr. Cordray, who is also from Ohio, had promised to testify before the Senate Appropriations Committee, although the panel still would not have power over the agency’s budget. He also said that Mr. Cordray had promised to obtain cost-benefit analyses on proposed regulations. Mr. Portman and other Republicans said they would continue to pursue structural reforms of the agency.The banking industry, which largely opposed the agency’s creation and then sought to prevent Mr. Cordray’s confirmation, found a silver lining on Tuesday in the prospect that the government would increase its oversight of other financial institutions.“What we’re looking for now is full steam ahead to level the playing field between banks and nonbanks,” said Richard Hunt, president of the Consumer Bankers Association. He cited payday lenders and Wal-Mart as particular examples of the kind of nonbank lenders that banks would like to see subjected to additional regulation.Mr. Hunt emphasized that his group had always been concerned about the agency’s structure, not about the particular choice of Mr. Cordray. “I think it would have been much better for the American people” if the structure had been changed, he said. “But I think that train has left the station after today’s vote.” Ms. Warren proposed the creation of a federal agency to protect consumers of financial products in a 2007 article, memorably arguing that the government put more effort into ensuring the safety of toaster ovens than the safety of mortgage loans. The idea resonated with Mr. Obama and his senior advisers, and it became a centerpiece of the administration’s proposal to overhaul financial regulation.Mr. Obama named Ms. Warren to oversee its creation, and she brought in Mr. Cordray after he lost a bid for re-election as Ohio attorney general, where he had pursued a series of investigations of financial companies.When Mr. Obama passed over Ms. Warren to nominate Mr. Cordray, she decided to run for the Senate instead. She has remained a vigorous advocate for the agency and for Mr. Cordray. “I can’t think how many times people said to me that this agency has no chance, none at all, that it will be killed in the crib,” she said. “I just couldn’t be more pleased.”Advertisement
